development of wind generator system be present , and suitable comparison criterion of different wind generator system be also discuss .

@card@ wind turbine concept and generator type
refer to the rotation speed , wind turbine concept can be classify into fix speed , limited variable speed and variable speed . for variable speed wind turbine , base on the rating of power converter relate to the generator capacity , they can be further classify into wind generator system with a partialscale and a full-scale power electronic converter . in addition , consider the drive train component , the wind turbine concept can be classify into geareddrive and direct-drive wind turbine . in geared-drive wind turbine , one conventional configuration be a multiple-stage gear with a high-speed generator ; the other one be the multibrid concept which have a singlestage gear and a low-speed generator [ @card@ ] . in this section , accord to contemporary wind turbine concept , the basic configuration and characteristic of different wind generator system be describe .

turbine system with a direct-drive generator , normally a low-speed high-torque synchronous generator and a full-scale power electronic converter be use . additionally , a variety of innovative concept of wind turbine appear , for example , an interesting alternative may be a mixed solution with a gearbox and a small low speed permanent magnet synchronous generator ( pmsg ) [ @card@ - @card@ ] , because direct-drive wind generator be become large and even more expensive for increase power level and decrease rotor speed . the main aim of this paper be to provide an overall perspective on various type of exist wind generator system and possible generator configuration , and some comparison of different wind generator system in literature and in the market . the paper be organise as follow . first , it give an overview of various wind turbine concept with respect to both their control ability and drive train type , include possible type of direct-drive permanent magnet ( pm ) machine . then the quantitative comparison of different wind generator system base on some available technical datum from literature be present , include their market penetration and share . finally , the trend and

@card@ fixed speed concept
the fix speed wind generator system have be use with a multiple-stage gearbox and a scig directly connect to the grid through a transformer as illustrate in fig . @ord@ because the scig operate only in a narrow range around the synchronous speed , the wind turbine equip with this type of generator be often call the fixed-speed wind generator system . this be the conventional concept apply by many Danish wind turbine manufacturer during the 1980s and 1990s , that be , an upwind , stall-regulated , three-bladed wind turbine concept use an scig [ @card@ , @card@ ] , so that it be also refer to as " Danish concept ' . since the scig always draw reactive power from the grid , during the 1980s this concept be extend with a capacitor bank for reactive power compensation . smooth grid connection be also achieve by incorporate a soft-starter . furthermore , a pole-changeable scig have be use , which lead two rotation speed . some manufacturer , such as micon ( currently merge into vesta ) , bonus ( currently siemens ) , make and nordex , have product base on this concept .

the well-known advantage of scig be it be robust , easy and relatively cheap for mass production . in addition , it enable stall-regulated machine to operate at a constant speed when it be connect to a large grid , which provide a stable control frequency . although the stall control method be usually use in combination with the fix speed scig for power control , the active stall control or pitch control have also be apply . the disadvantage of scig for the fix speed wind turbine concept be as follow [ @card@ , @card@ - @card@ ] . † the speed be not controllable and variable only over a very narrow range , in which only speed high than the synchronous speed be possible for generator operation . because a high slip mean a high dissipation of electrical energy in the rotor bar , for example , the slip be normally not high than @card@ % for @card@ mw wind turbine [ @card@ ] . additionally , the fix speed concept mean that wind speed fluctuation be directly translate into electromechanical torque variation , this cause high mechanical and fatigue stress on the system ( turbine blade , gearbox and generator ) and may result in swing oscillation between turbine and generator shaft . also the periodical torque dip because of the tower shadow and shear effect be not damp by speed variation and result in high flicker . furthermore , the turbine speed can not be adjust with the wind speed to optimise the aerodynamic efficiency . although a pole-changeable scig have be use in some commercial wind turbine , it do not provide continuous speed variation . † a three-stage gearbox in the drive train be necessary for this wind turbine concept . gearbox represent a large mass in the nacelle , and also a large fraction of the investment cost . † it be necessary to obtain the excitation current from the stator terminal of scig . this make it impossible to support grid voltage control . in most case , capacitor be connect in parallel to the generator to compensate for the reactive power consumption .

figure @card@ scheme of a limited variable speed concept with wrig system ( optislip )

the stator of wrig be directly connect to the grid , whereas the rotor winding be connect in series with a controlled resistor . variable-speed operation can be achieve by control the energy extract from the wrig rotor ; however , this power must be dissipate in the external resistor . with the increase in variable speed range , a high slip mean a high power extract by the rotor , and the low generator efficiency , so that the rating of the resistor must also be high . therefore the dynamic speed control range depend on the size of the variable rotor resistance , and the energy extract from the external resistor be also dump as heat loss in the controllable rotor resistance . a typical limited variable speed range be less than @card@ % above the synchronous speed [ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ ] . additionally , the slip ring may be avoid , for example , the wind turbine manufacturer vesta build the power converter and resistor on the rotor , the control signal be transmit to the rotate electronics by an optical coupling . furthermore , reactive power compensation and a soft-starter be also require for this concept .

@card@ variable speed concept with a partial-scale power converter
this configuration be know as the dfig concept , which correspond to a variable speed wind turbine with a wrig and a partial-scale power converter on the rotor circuit , as illustrate in fig . @ord@ the stator be directly connect to the grid , whereas the rotor be connect through a power electronic converter . the power converter control the rotor frequency and thus the rotor speed . this concept support a wide speed range operation , depend on the size of the frequency converter . typically , the variable speed range be +30 % around the synchronous speed [ @card@ , @card@ - @card@ ] . the rating of the power electronic converter be only @card@ - @card@ % of the generator capacity , which make this concept attractive and popular from an economic point of view . there be many manufacturer , such as vesta , gamesa , repower ,

@card@ limited variable speed concept
the limited variable speed concept with a multiple-stage gearbox be also know as the optislip concept , which have be apply by the Danish manufacturer vesta since the mid 1990s [ @card@ , @card@ ] . this wind turbine concept use a wound rotor induction generator ( wrig ) with variable rotor resistance by mean of a power electronic converter and the pitch control method , as show in fig . @ord@ presently , manufacturer of vesta and suzlon have product base on this concept .

nordex , use this concept in the market . the large capacity for the commercial wind turbine product with dfig have be up to @card@ mw from repower . compare with the optislip concept , the rotor energy , instead of be dissipate , can be feed into the grid by the power electronic converter . moreover , the power converter system can perform reactive power compensation and smooth grid connection , for example , the grid-side converter can control its reactive power , independently of the generator operation ; this allow the performance of voltage support towards the grid . however , the dfig system have the follow disadvantage [ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ ] . † a multi-stage gearbox be still necessary in the drive train because the speed range for dfig be far from a common turbine speed of @card@ - @card@ rpm . a gearbox be inevitable to have some drawback , such as heat dissipation from friction , regular maintenance and audible noise . † the slip ring be use to transfer the rotor power by mean of a partial-scale converter , which require a regular maintenance , and maybe result in machine failure and electrical loss . † under grid fault condition , on the one hand , large stator current result in large rotor current , so that the power electronic converter need to be protect from destroy ; on the other hand , large stator peak current may cause high torque load on the drive train of wind turbine . † accord to grid connection requirement for wind turbine , in case of grid disturbance , a ride-through capability of dfig be also require , so that the corresponding control strategy may be complicate . flux density limitation , a high torque also require a large machine ' S volume , so that the torque density could not be further significantly increase . to increase the efficiency , to reduce the weight of the active part and to keep the end wind loss small , direct-drive generator be usually design with a large diameter and small pole pitch [ @card@ , @card@ ] . in addition , the advantage of direct-drive wind turbine be the simplify drive train , the high overall efficiency , the high reliability and availability by omit the gearbox . compare with the variable speed concept with a partial-scale power converter , the full-scale power converter can perform smooth grid connection over the entire speed range . however , it have a high cost and a high power loss in the power electronics , since all the generate power have to pass through the power converter . basically , type of direct-drive generator use in the market can be classify into the electrically excite synchronous generator ( eesg ) and the pmsg . the main feature of eesg be describe in section @card@ . the feature of different topology of pmsg be present in section @card@ . @card@ electrically excite synchronous generator : the eesg be usually build with a rotor carry the field system provide with a dc excitation . the stator carry a three-phase winding quite similar to that of the induction machine . the rotor may have salient pole or may be cylindrical . salient pole be more usual in low-speed machine and may be the most useful version for application to direct-drive wind turbine . a grid connection scheme of eesg for direct-drive wind turbine be show in fig . @ord@ the amplitude and frequency of the voltage can be fully control by the power electronic at the generator side , so that the generator speed be fully controllable over a wide range , even to very low speed . in addition , the eesg have the opportunity of control the flux for a minimise loss in different power range , because the excitation current can be control by mean of the power converter in the rotor side . moreover , it do not require the use of pms , which would represent a large fraction of the generator cost , and might suffer from performance loss in harsh atmospheric condition . therefore it be the mostly use direct-drive generator type in the

@card@ variable speed direct-drive concept with a full-scale power converter
this configuration may correspond to a variable speed wind turbine with a direct-drive generator connect to the grid through a full-scale power converter . the most important difference between gear drive wind turbine and direct-drive type be the generator rotor speed . the direct-drive generator rotate at a low speed , because the generator rotor be directly connect on the hub of the turbine rotor . to deliver a certain power , the low speed make it necessary to produce a high torque . a high torque mean a large size of the generator . therefore for direct-drive generator , the low speed and high torque operation require multi-poles , which demand a large diameter for implementation of large number of pole with a reasonable pitch . moreover , for a large direct-drive generator , consider on the current loading and gap

drum , and therefore the total length of the magnetic path can be reduce . as the rotor be directly expose to the wind , the cool condition can be improve for the magnet so that the resistance to temperature demagnetisation be enhance . moreover , Chen et al . [ @card@ ] have also make a comparison of different pm wind generator topology . in addition , hanitsch and korouji [ @card@ ] have design a rare-earth rfpm wind-energy generator with a new topology , which be construct from two rotor and one stator with short end winding . it can improve the performance of the machine by reduce the weight , increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of active material . axial-flux pm machine : the axial-flux pm ( afpm ) machine be a machine produce magnetic flux in the axial direction , instead of the radial direction . two type of afpm machine , the slotless and slot surface-mounted pm , have be mostly discuss in reference . compare with rfpm machine , the advantage of afpm machine can be summarise as follow : † simple winding , † low cog torque and noise ( in slotless machine ) , † short axial length , † high torque / volume ratio . however , the disadvantage of afpm machine in comparison with rfpm machine be as follow [ @card@ , @card@ ] : † low torque / mass ratio † large outer diameter , large amount of pm and structural instability ( in slotless machine ) † difficulty to maintain air gap in large diameter ( in slot machine ) † difficulty in production of stator core ( in slot machine ) .

a single-sided afpm with rotor balance and a slotless single-stator double-rotor ( torus machine ) , have be investigate and compare with rfpm machine by Chen et al . [ @card@ ] . accord to [ @card@ ] , the two-sided afpm machine be superior to the one-sided afpm machine ; however , one-sided construction use less copper and have a low conduction loss . the torus construction be simple ; however , it require more magnet weight because of the presence of the additional air gap for accommodate stator winding . as the power rating increase , both the air gap and air gap reluctance become large , so that this construction be more suitable for low power rating wind generator . in addition , the potential application of soft magnetic composite ( smc ) material apply to the low speed , direct-drive axial flux pm wind generator be also discuss by Chen et al . comparative design study be conduct on different configuration pm generator with both lamination core and smc core [ @card@ ] . transversal-flux pm machine : the transverse-flux principle mean that the path of the magnetic flux be perpendicular to the direction of the rotor rotation . there be also some different rotor structure for this technology , such as the rotor with single-sided surface magnet with single-sided flux concentration and with double-sided flux concentration . fig . @card@ show the configuration of a surface-mounted transverse-flux pmsg [ @card@ ] . a transverse flux pm ( tfpm ) machine be a synchronous machine in nature , and it will function in a manner similar to any other pmsg in principle . compare with longitudinal machine , tfpm machine have some advantage , such as high force density , considerably low copper loss and simple winding . however , the force density of tfpm machine with large air gap may be a little high or even low depend on the outside diameter [ @card@ , @card@ ] . the construction of tfpm machine be much more complicated than longitudinal flux machine . compare with rfpm or afpm machine , a major difference be that tfpm machine allow an increase in the space for the simple winding without decrease the available space for the main flux , and so that the

machine have very low copper loss . tfpm machine can also be make with a very small pole pitch ; however , the electromagnetic structure be much more complicated . tfpm machine have also the low power factor , which lead to an increase in the necessary rating of the power electronic converter . tfpm machine have be discuss in a number of reference [ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ ] . reference [ @card@ , @card@ ] show that the weight of a @card@ kw tfpm machine be about half of the total weight of an asynchronous machine with a gearbox . tfpm machine seem to be suitable for direct-drive application because of the high specific torque , although special method of manufacturing and assembly be require [ @card@ ] . Harris et al . [ @card@ ] compare the advantage and disadvantage of three different tfpm machine topology , which include a single-sided surface-mounted pm machine , a single-sided surface-mounted pm machine with stator bridge and a double-sided flux concentrate pm machine [ @card@ ] .

@card@ variable speed multiple-stage gear concept with a full-scale power converter
@card@ pmsg system : a pmsg system with a multiplegearbox be use in order to reduce the generator ' S volume and improve the generator efficiency in variable speed wind turbine concept with a full-scale power converter . fig . @card@ show the grid connection scheme of this concept . compare with the dfig system , this wind generator system have the follow advantage . † the generator have a good efficiency . † the generator can be brushless . † the grid-fault ride-through capability be less complex . and the follow disadvantage : † large , more expensive converter ( @card@ % of rate power instead of @card@ % ) , † the loss in the converter be high because all power be process by the power electronic converter . in the market , this configuration have be use in ge multi-megawatt series . @card@ scig system : in order to fulfill the variable speed operation with an scig , an alternative generator system that might replace the capacitor bank and soft-starter of " Danish concept ' be a variable speed multiple-stage gear scig with a full-scale converter , as show in fig . @card@ .

compare with " Danish concept ' as mention above , this concept have advantage of the flexible control with a full-scale power , such as variable speed operation , good performance of reactive power compensation and smooth grid connection . however , its disadvantage be the high cost and loss of the fullscale converter , the efficiency of the total system ( gearbox induction generator and converter ) may be low . presently , siemens be use this concept with the rate power of @card@ mw ( bonus @card@ ) in the market , and the generator speed range be design to be @card@ - @card@ rpm . the decrease cost of power electronics ( roughly a factor of @card@ over the past @card@ year ) and the absence of brush may make variable speed multiple-stage gear concept ( both pmsg and scig as mention above ) more attractive .

@card@ trend discussion
the fault ride-through capability be require to avoid significant loss of wind power production in the event of grid fault . this mean wind turbine should stay connect and contribute to the grid in case of a disturbance such as a voltage dip . they should immediately supply active and reactive power for frequency and voltage recovery after the fault have be clear . as an example , the requirement concern immunity to voltage dip as prescribe by e.on Netz , a grid operator in northern germany , be show in fig . @ord@ only when the grid voltage drop below the curve ( in duration or voltage level ) , the turbine be allow to be disconnect . when the voltage be in the shaded area , the turbine should also supply reactive power to the grid in order to support grid restoration [ @card@ ] .

with rapid development of wind turbine technology , future trend in the wind turbine industry will probably be focus on the gradual improvement of already know technology , which can be summarise as follow [ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ ] . † the power level of a single wind turbine will continue to increase , because this reduce the cost of place wind turbine , especially for offshore wind farm . † offshore wind energy be more attractive , because of high wind speed and more space than on shore wind energy . † an increase trend be to remove disperse single wind turbine in favour of concentrated wind turbine in large wind farm . † an increase trend in the penetration of wind power into the power system .

@card@ trend of wind generator system
accord to the survey of different wind generator system and consider the grid connection requirement on wind turbine , the develop trend of wind generator system may be summarise as follow . † variable speed concept variable speed operation be very attractive for a number of reason , include reduce mechanical stress and increase power capture . as mention , the market share of the fix speed concept have decrease slightly , whereas variable speed wind turbine increase . for various variable speed wind turbine concept , a multiple-stage geared-drive dfig with a partial-scale power converter be still dominant in the current market . compare with other variable speed concept with a full-scale power converter , the main advantage of this concept be only @card@ % of the generate power pass through the power converter , so that it may have substantial cost advantage even with lowcost power electronics in the future . however , from the viewpoint of the fault ride-through capability , the

@card@ grid connection requirement
the penetration of wind power into the power system continue to increase , which imply the situation of the large wind farm be change from be simple energy source to have power plant status with grid support characteristic . one major challenge in the present and come year be the connection and optimise integration of large wind farm into electrical grid [ @card@ ] . with increase wind power capacity , transmission system operator ( tsos ) have become concerned about the impact of high level of wind power generation on power system . to handle large-scale integration of wind power , tsos have issue grid code and grid requirement for wind turbine connection and operation . the main issue of grid code can be summarise as follow [ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ ] : † active power control , † reactive power control , † voltage and frequency control , † power quality , for example , flicker and harmonic , † fault ride-through capability . as mention above , the power-control capability and the fault ride-through capability be mainly concern by some tsos . wind farm be require to behave as conventional power plant in power system , such as regulate active and reactive power and perform frequency and voltage control . and

dfig system have to endure large peak current during grid fault , an advanced protection system may be require . on the contrary , variable speed wind turbine with a full-scale power converter may be more effective and less complicated to deal with gridrelated problem . therefore variable speed wind turbine concept with a full-scale power converter will become more attractive . † direct-drive concept compare with geared-drive wind generator system , the main advantage of direct-drive wind generator system be higher overall efficiency , reliability and availability because of omit the gearbox . although the size of direct-drive generator be usually large , it may not be a serious disadvantage for the offshore wind energy . † pm excited generator type pm machine be more attractive and superior with high efficiency and energy yield , high reliability and power to weight ratio compare with electricityexcited machine . accord to the above survey of rfpm , afpm and tfpm machine , rfpm machine with surface-mounted pm may be more suitable for direct-drive pm generator type , because of allow the simple generator structure , good utilisation of the active material and also allow the relatively small diameter in comparison with afpm and trpm machine . in the case of afpm machine , the disadvantage as describe in section @card@ , which make the machine cost increase and manufacturing difficult , must be solve or improve significantly . although tfpm machine have some advantage , such as high-force density and simple wind with low copper loss , the disadvantage , such as low-force density in large air gap , complicated construction in manufacturing and low power factor may be obvious . however , tfpm still have potential to be use as a direct-drive pm generator with new topology design , since the machine be more flexible for new topology . consider the performance of pms be improve and the cost of pm be decrease in recent year , in addition to that the cost of power electronics be decrease , variable speed direct-drive pm machine with a full-scale power converter become more attractive for offshore wind power . on the other hand , variable speed concept with a full-scale power converter and a single- or multiple-stage gearbox drive train may be interesting solution not only in respect to the annual energy yield per cost but also in respect to the total weight . for example , the market interest of pmsg system with a multiple-stage gearbox or a single-stage gearbox be increase .

although the market share in the fixed-speed wind turbine concept have decrease , the market interest in scig base on wind turbine may increase [ @card@ ] , if it be demonstrate that high voltage direct current transmission ( hvdc ) technologies-based wind farm consist of such scig be robust to grid fault . because hvdc can enhance the ability against power system fault , consequently , the generator , which be sensitive to power system fault such as scig , can be use without the problem of ride through power system fault . furthermore , a variable speed scig system with a full-scale power converter have be use for over @card@ mw wind turbine , such as bonus @card@ model @card@ mw of siemens wind power . it be clear that power electronics will continue to play an important role in the integration of future large wind farm and design of wind generator system .

@card@ discussion of comparison criterion
various criterion may be use for compare different wind generator system , include the torque density , the cost per torque , the efficiency , the active material weight , the outer diameter , the total length , the total volume , the total generator cost , the annual energy yield , the energy yield per cost , the cost of energy and so on [ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ ] . however , with the increase in wind energy penetration into grid and the development of grid connection requirement , overall qualitative comparison criterion consider wind power quality and wind energy yield may be worthwhile for consideration . † current trend of research and development of wind turbine concept be mostly relate to offshore wind energy . the most important difference between the requirement for onshore and offshore wind energy technology be that it be much more important for offshore turbine to be robust and maintenancefree [ @card@ , @card@ ] , because it be extremely expensive and difficult and even impossible to do offshore maintenance and reparation under some weather condition , so that the reliability and availability of large wind generator system may be more important aspect to be take into consideration . † with the increase penetration of wind energy into the grid , some performance relate with grid connection requirement may need to be consider in the quantitative comparison . for example , the solution of the flicker problem may yield an extra cost depend on the type of wind generator system . the fault ride-through capability be also strongly relate to the type of the wind generator system . † some performance index refer to wind turbine may have important effect on the annual energy yield of

Mankato ' S population and power need the current usage by the average minnesota resident be @card@ kwh per month ( mpca ) . base on the population of @card@ , @card@ ( @card@ census ) this give us the city ' s usage per month at @card@ gwh in the year @ord@ when the cost of $ @card@ per kwh ( as charge by xcel energy ) be factor in it add up pretty quick to $ @card@ per mwh or $ @card@ per resident per month . the cost of @card@ gwh of energy per month be @card@ million dollar . base on projected growth the city of Mankato / north mankato will reach approx @card@ , @card@ people in the year @ord@ use today ' S price quote the monthly cost of energy will be @card@ million dollar . what can we do to prepare for the future ? we can both buy renewable energy and reduce our own use of electrical power . the city council of mankato can provide leadership on both of these point . it be in the long-term interest of the citizen of mankato to both increase our consumption of renewable energy and decrease our use overall of electricity . reduce emission from coal plant in minnesota about @card@ % of our electricity be generate in coal-fired plant . peak plant use natural gas . nuclear energy be generate at three plant in minnesota . estimate for wind power range from @card@ % . source : http : / / replaced-dns / oea / energy / replaced-dns ) . while coal be currently the cheap generating source , it be not renewable and it be not clean . coal-fired plant be able to mitigate the emission with scrubber . emission from coal-fired plant include mercury ( hg ) , sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) , nitrogen oxide ( nox ) , and carbon dioxide ( co2 ) . carbon dioxide be the main greenhouse gas and therefore contribute to global warming . for emission by fuel in minnesota , see http : / / replaced-dns / replaced-dns for information on greenhouse gas , see http : / / replaced-dns / @card@ / share / spl / hi / sci_nat / @card@ / climate_change / html / replaced-dns reduce our consumption of non-renewable energy renewable energy source include wind , solar , and hydroelectric . non-renewables be carbon fuel include petroleum derivative , coal , and natural gas . we have @card@ year of " easy " coal leave in the world . we have @card@ year of natural gas leave in the u.s. which be our main source of gas . green power option in mankato there be green power program at both xcel and benco . for more information about green power , see the u.s. department of energy ' S " buy green power " : http : / / replaced-dns / greenpower / buying / buying_ replaced-dns ? state = mn benco electric ' s wellspring program through benco ' S generating and transmission source , great river energy , consumer can participate in the wellspring program . see : http : / / replaced-dns / environment / replaced-dns xcel ' S windsource currently xcel energy Inc. have a windsource ® option for provide energy for family . this process allow customer to buy energy that have be produce on wind farm in minnesota . this energy be provide on a first come , first serve basis , since there isn ' t a sufficient amount of energy create on the wind farm for everyone to use . a total of @card@ wind turbine locate in pipestone and dodge county in minnesota currently supply the wind energy . since there be a wait list to be put on in order to receive some of this power , there be obviously a good reason to add more wind turbine to this number . in addition it be project that if there be no wait list , more customer would use this method . the rate will start to decrease the more you use the energy , promote the long-term use of such an environmentally friendly energy source . windsource be available on a first come first serve basis . the cost of windsource energy will be base strictly on how much electricity use during a monthly period . windsource be price at a charge of $ @card@ per @card@ kwh block as of january @card@ , @ord@ this be a graph showing how wind source adjustment be calculate . wind energy rate , per @card@ kwh block : $ @card@ less eca * * , per @card@ kwh block : $ @card@ less aqir * , per @card@ kwh block : $ @card@ monthly wind energy service adjustment $ @card@ * the aqir be design to recover cost associate with air quality improvement ( emission reduction ) at three denver / boulder power plant . xcel energy complete these project to reduce emission voluntarily . the rider become effective January @card@ , @card@ , and will be in effect for @card@ year . because the aqir be for cost to improve our fossil fuel plant , windsource customer receive an aqir credit for their wind purchase . if they receive all of their electricity from wind , they receive a credit for the entire aqir . the aqir be calculate by multiply the aqir factor by the amount of kilowatt-hour you use . the aqir fluctuate on an annual basis . * * the electric commodity adjustment ( eca ) become effective on january @card@ , @ord@ the eca recover ongoing cost associate with purchase energy and generation fuel . all rate schedule be subject to the eca . because the eca be for cost associate with fossil fuel plant , windsource ® customer receive an eca credit for their wind purchase . if they receive all of their electricity from wind , they receive a credit for the entire eca . source : http : / / replaced-dns / xlweb / cda / @card@ , @card@ , 1-1-2_735_11612-3320-5_538_969-0 , 00.html reduce our consumption of electrical power a corner stone of any energy program in mankato should be a savings program whereby citizen and commercial customer would be encourage to use less electricity . campaign to increase the use of long-life light bulb and to low thermostat setting in the winter and raise them in the summer would all be helpful . see these figure for Canadian cost comparison : http : / / replaced-dns / English / study / comparative_costs_of_generation_technologies_ replaced-dns how much do wind energy cost ?

today ' S machine be available in size from 700kw to @card@ kw ( awea ) . the cost of a machine vary by size . why large machine ? large machine be able to deliver electricity at a low cost than small machine . in area where it be difficult to find site for more than a single turbine , a large turbine with a tall tower use the existing wind resource more efficiently . while 5mw generator have become a reality in today ' S world , they be mostly off shore where there be no tower or wind restriction . the farming community base around the mankato area would be ideal for wind farm construction due to mile of flat ground with little growth other than agriculture , " state Michael Greenland of smi & hydraulics during a phone conversation with a student . he further comment , " once a site have be determine a wind study be conduct . optimum turbine size be determine by the wind study . a power purchase agreement , along with a " who pay what ' contract can be negotiate after the wind study determine what turbine to use . " large or small turbine ? reason for choose large turbine there be economy of scale in wind turbine , i.e. . large machine be usually able to deliver electricity at a low cost than small machine . the reason be that the cost of foundation , road building , electrical grid connection , plus a number of component in the turbine ( the electronic control system etc . ) , be somewhat independent of the size of the machine . large machine be particularly well suit for offshore wind power . the cost of foundation do not rise in proportion to the size of the machine , and maintenance cost be largely independent of the size of the machine . in area where it be difficult to find site for more than a single turbine , a large turbine with a tall tower use the existing wind resource more efficiently . reason for choose small turbine the local electrical grid may be too weak to handle the electricity output from a large machine . this may be the case in remote part of the electrical grid with low population density and little electricity consumption in the area . there be less fluctuation in the electricity output from a wind park consist of a number of small machine , since wind fluctuation occur randomly , and therefore tend to cancel out . again , small machine may be an advantage in a weak electrical grid . the cost of use large crane , and build a road strong enough to carry the turbine component may make small machine more economic in some area . several small machine spread the risk in case of temporary machine failure , e.g. . due to lightning strike . aesthetic landscape consideration may sometimes dictate the use of small machine . large machine , however , will usually have a much low rotational speed , which mean that one large machine really do not attract as much attention as many small , fast move rotor . output range ( kilowatt ) for each size of turbine the amount of energy give by wind be : p = ( @card@ / @card@ * air density ) * ( area of turbine ) * ( wind velocity ^ @card@ ) wind turbine be only able to use about @card@ % of the wind energy that flow through the cross sectional area . much more energy be create at high wind speed . so the majority of power be create in short burst . half the energy be create in about @card@ % of the operation time . wind power availability be very dependent on the site of the turbine . the capacity factor of a wind turbine be about @card@ % , which mean that a turbine will only be able to produce about @card@ % of its theoretical power output . source : replaced-dns what type of turbine be there ? horizontal turbine horizontal axis wind turbine ( hawt ) have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator at the top of a tower , and must be point into the wind . the gearbox and generator be locate at the top of the tower . this be a disadvantage because in order to maintain them a person have to climb to the top to do it . an advantage though be that the blade can change their direction and tilt , therefore , they be always collect the maximum amount of wind . the amount of energy produce by wind be p = ( @card@ / @card@ * air density ) * ( area of turbine ) * ( wind velocity ^ b ) where p = power and b = number of blade ( replaced-dns ) . vertical turbine vertical axis wind turbine ( or vawts ) have the main rotor shaft run vertically . the generator and gearbox be locate on the ground ; this be advantageous because when maintenance need to be do no one need to climb up a tall tower . mesa , hilltop , ridgelines and pass have wind that be low to the ground and this type of wind turbine can gather this wind the most efficiently . however , these turbine need to be install on level land . a weibull distribution graph be usually use to describe the wind variation in a give area . this graph show the percentage of time of a give wind speed . this graph be use to find the power availability since wind power be proportional to the cube of wind speed . a perfectly design turbine would be able to pull only @card@ % of the wind ' s potential energy ( Betz ' S law ) . an actual turbine be not @card@ % efficient so it would only be able to pull about @card@ % of the @card@ % possible through Betz ' S law . as the wind pass through the turbine the wind slow down . an ideal turbine would only slow wind to @card@ / @card@ of its original speed . wind turbine be also design to start operate at certain wind speed and stop operate at high speed . source : replaced-dns energy unit the ability to generate electricity be measure in watt . watt be very small unit , so the term kilowatt ( kw , @card@ , @card@ watt ) , megawatt ( mw , @card@ million watt ) , and gigawatt ( pronounce ` ` jig-a-watt , ' ' gw , @card@ billion watt ) be most commonly use to describe the capacity of generate unit like wind turbine or other power plant . electricity production and consumption be most commonly measure in kilowatt-hour ( kwh ) . a kilowatt-hour mean one kilowatt ( @card@ , @card@ watt ) of electricity produce or consume for one hour . one 50-watt light bulb leave on for @card@ hour consume one kilowatt-hour of electricity ( @card@ watt x @card@ hour = @card@ , @card@ watt-hour = @card@ kilowatt-hour ) . the output of a wind turbine depend on the turbine ' S size and the wind ' s speed through the rotor . wind turbine be manufacture now have power rating range from @card@ watt to @card@ megawatt ( mw ) . example : a 10-kw wind turbine can generate about @card@ , @card@ kwh annually at a site with wind speed average @card@ mile per hour , or about enough to power a typical household . a 5-mw turbine can produce more than @card@ million kwh in a year -- enough to power more than @card@ , @card@ household . the average u.s. household consume about @card@ , @card@ kwh of electricity each year . source : American wind energy association , minnesota pollution control a gency , cielo wind power , and the Danish wind i ndustry association faa regulation faa regulation require aircraft warning light install on all tower tall than @card@ foot . turbine on wind energy farm generally stand between @card@ to @card@ foot high . there could be more than @card@ generator on stretch of land reach for mile . engineer visit eleven site to come up with recommendation to enhance aviation safety while satisfy the concern of neighbor . the blue canyon wind farm near Lawton , oklahoma , consist of @card@ turbine top with only @card@ light . visual guidance expert install light on windmill at each end of a row , then space light on tower a half-mile apart . they have determine that configuration should be sufficient to indicate the farm to pilot , without create light pollution for surround community . with height of modern utility-scale wind turbine exceed @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) , wind energy developer in recent year have have to submit light proposal for wind plant to the federal aviation administration ( faa ) . the current faa guideline for wind plant obstruction lighting have not be develop to a level where developer can know with some certainty what lighting scheme the faa will approve for propose construction . the california wind energy collaborative ( cwec ) initiate a study of faa obstruction lighting for wind plant to determine the issue surround the subject . a literature survey and interview on the subject be conduct . during the period of investigation , the cwec be able to observe flight test with the faa of a wind farm configure for new lighting standard . key element of the propose standard be synchronization of the flash light and maximum @card@ mi . ( @card@ km ) spacing between lighted turbine . it be expect that the new standard will improve flight safety and streamline the faa recommendation and permit process for wind plant development . source : http : / / replaced-dns / pier / final_project_reports / replaced-dns site ( location ) when choose a site for a possible wind farm you need to plan the actual site and location , whether you will buy or rent land . all these part , when form together make up the site location . use this information will enable you to make the well possible choice for a wind farm location . wind energy be grow in the energy market . with any business like this , rural landowner that be interested in lease land should do some research in the process . lease , tax and easement be major concern for step deal with wind turbine land . wind developer must take into consideration some idea before lease land for install a wind turbine . they need to line up fund for the project and have some type of commitment from the energy buyer . also to complete any need ecological analysis , zone and permit process . if the place they be set up be a good wind source , many of the wind developer will make a written contract with the land owner to show what step will be take and also to show these agreement in writing . if it all go in the beginning of this project then a lease agreement will be make . the landowner might not have many financial responsibility , but the wind developer will try to offer some type of payment plan . wind farm in minnesota main minnesota wind power project be in buffalo ridge . in july @card@ there be @card@ wind project in minnesota operate @card@ turbine and which be enough to power about @card@ , @card@ home . a @card@ county area in southwest minnesota be home to more then @card@ percent of the state wind power production . existing project be locate in north shaokatan , shaokatan hill , lake benton ii , Viking , chanarambie , moraine , woodstock , buffalo ridge , ruthton , lake Benton i , and lakota ridge . land lease rate farmer in southern minnesota who choose to lease land to wind developer can annually receive @card@ @card@ dollar per turbine .

" source : http : / / replaced-dns / neq_online / oct2003 / oct2003.02.htm leasing land with any business like this , rural landowner interested in lease land should do some research in the process . lease , tax and easement be major concern for step when deal with wind turbine land . wind developer must take into consideration some idea before lease land for install a wind turbine . next , they need to line up fund for the project and have some type of commitment from the energy buyer . finally , they must complete any need ecological analysis , zone and permit process . also if the place they be set up be a good wind source . wind developer will make a written contract with the landowner to show what step will be take and also to show these agreement in writing . if it all go in the beginning of this project then a lease agreement will be make . the landowner might not have many financial responsibility , but the wind developer will try to offer some type of payment plan . many people do not buy the land but lease it or even have an easement which be an interest in land that be own by another that give the owner interest to a limited use or enjoyment of the land . wind project require a permit from one or more government agency . it can be permit within @card@ month . permit include federal , state and local agency . this include existing law and regulation , location of wind turbine and associate facility or equipment , need for transmission line , access road , size of wind farm and ownership of land . the great benefit of have wind turbine on their property will be the contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emission and for other it will be the guarantee income for the life of the turbine ( @card@ to @card@ year ) . currently you could expect up to $ @card@ per megawatt install ( or part there off ) per annum with no expenditure at all . the process of establish wind turbine can be a draw out affair and may take @card@ to @card@ year from first contact to construction and commission . thing to consider before building on a site : consultation with neighbor and nearby resident consultation with local community consultation with the council the undertaking of an environmental effect study a study into flora and fauna ( bird ) issue native title issue plan and permit wind turbine pose little threat to bird ; there be little real evidence here or overseas that bird strike on wind turbine present any real problem provide the turbine be place with care and thought . the American who in the @card@ ' S build several wind farm in california have largely cause the concern regard bird strike . these wind farm be build without consideration of aesthetic or environmental issue and cause many problem include bird kill . the wind industry worldwide have learn from this experience and no reputable wind farm developer would consider the wall-to-wall wind turbine option . ice fall from turbine may be a concern in some area . transmission transmission line electrical power transmission refer to bulky transfer of electric power from a power plant to a substation . power transmission usually take place at high voltage ( usually @card@ kv or above ) due to very large amount of power involve . electric power can be transmit in two way : overhead transmission . underground transmission . transmission loss it be necessary to transmit the electricity at high voltage to reduce the fraction of energy lose . for a give amount of power transmit , a high voltage reduce the current and thus the resistive loss in the conductor . long distance transmission be typically do with overhead line at voltage of @card@ to @card@ kv . in an alternate current transmission line , the inductance and capacitance of the line conductor can be significant . the current that flow in these component of transmission line impedance constitute reactive power , which transmit no energy to the load . reactive current flow cause extra loss in the transmission circuit . the fraction of real power ( transmit to the load ) to the apparent power be the power factor . so as reactive current increase , which will increase the reactive power , by result power factor reduce . for low power factor , loss will increase . utility add capacitor bank and other component throughout the system - such as phase-shifting transformer , static var compensator , and flexible ac transmission system ( fact ) - to control reactive power flow for reduction of loss and stabilization of system voltage . potential problem because they must generally be site in exposed place , wind turbine be often highly visible . some people might view these turbine as an eyesore , however proper sit decision can help to avoid any aesthetic impact to the landscape . one strategy that could be use to partially offset visual impact be to site few turbine in one specific location . with the technology of today ' s large and more efficient model of wind turbine this be quite possible . like all mechanical system wind turbine produce some noise when they operate . most of the turbine noise be mask by the wind itself , and naturally the wind turbine only work when the wind be blow . one of the big concern be that wind turbine could be possibly cause potential interference with radar and telecommunication facility . lastly , the only potentially toxic or hazardous material that be tie into wind turbine , be the relatively small amount of lubricate oil and hydraulic and insulation fluid . contamination of surface , ground water , and soil be highly unlikely because of this . source : http : / / replaced-dns / guide / concern / replaced-dns ( view on @card@ ) as you can see when deal with environmental issue , wind turbine benefit out weigh the concern . in deal with this information wind turbine should seriously be consider be install , to help reverse our deteriorating environment . budget cost tubular tower account for about @card@ % of the total cost lattice tower account for about @card@ % of the total cost source : smi & hydraulics , http : / / replaced-dns / aspx / news / replaced-dns ? newsid = @card@ the cost of wind tower and power line vary greatly depend on location . therefore only rough estimate could be make without get an estimate and contract from a company . lattice and tubular tower be available . however tubular tower be the most popular choice . the tower itself generally cost about @card@ % of the total project . accord to Michael greenman at smi & hydraulics in porter , mn from their most recent project the total cost of the tower be as follow : @card@ meter - 1.25mw - $ @card@ , @card@ ;

Jeff casalina page page @card@ building on the uw-green bay master plan : promote sustainability energy generation and conservation option environmental science & policy @card@ capstone class Dec. @card@ , @card@ jackie blohowiak Jeff casalina Ryuichi Iwasaki dustin maas there be a grow movement among college campus to improve the sustainability and environmental consciousness of the campus experience . rise energy price and a backlash to the current administration policy on issue such as global climate change have spark an interest in sustainability . for the current seminar in environmental science and policy ( also know as the " capstone seminar " ) the student decide to look at sustainability option for the uw- green bay campus . the focus of our group be energy . our group , consist of jackie blohowiak , Ryuichi Iwasaki , Dustin Maas and Jeff casalina , do some investigation that include two meeting with the facility manager , les Raduenz , and a tour of the " power plant " that generate and supply heat and cool for the major building on campus . ( a misnomer , the power plant , do not generate any power . ) Mr. Raduenz provide us with the July @card@ ( the high month for energy usage ) power bill from the local utility and printout of the entire electricity and natural gas charge and amount consume for the past year . he also supply a list of campus vehicle and datum on gasoline and diesel consumption . limited opportunity for great energy efficiency accord to Mr. Raduenz , the university have already do most of what it can to conserve energy . thermostat be monitor at the power plant and be set to the most efficient comfort level possible . budget restraint limit the number of campus vehicle , and landscape vehicle usage be curtail by reduce the amount of grassy area that be mow . while it would seem that there be always room for improvement , additional efficiency appear limit by several significant factor : many of the campus building be construct in the 1970s , and retrofitting for energy saving would be prohibitively expensive , if not physically impossible . while there be the possibility of install sub-metering ( describe below ) to identify area of inefficiency , change the ventilation system so that some room within a building could be heat or cool while other in the building would not would require rework the entire ductwork and thermostat control wiring of every building . because campus building be consider commercial structure , they fall under the ashrae requirement of supply a minimum of @card@ cubic foot per minute per person of fresh outside air ( ashrae , @card@ ) . in order to comply with this standard , ventilation system be set to provide six complete air change per hour . all of this air be heat or cool and then exhaust outdoors . this requirement negate many of the efficiency common in residential construction , most notably seal the home from the intrusion of outside air . laboratory chemical hood require additional exhaust of interior air to the outside . social factor associate with different work habit and comfort requirement be also significant and not readily changeable . there be instance where one person may want to work late or on a weekend . this require that the entire building be heat or cool for that one person . the suggestion that night or weekend class all be hold in the same building ( so that only one building need heating and cooling ) instead of throughout the campus have be meet with opposition since different department prefer to use their own building and may require specialized room such as laboratory and art studio . Mary Ann Cofrin ( mac ) hall be an example of some of the efficiency that might be achieve if the university be give a " clean slate " in design a new building . construct only three year ago , the building incorporate passive solar , photovoltaic and green construction design feature . nevertheless , its efficiency be nominal as it only generate enough electricity to power a few computer or cell phone , and the ventilation system function in the same manner as the other building on campus . if the university be serious about sustainability , new construction need to go further in achieve energy efficiency . sub- meter as Mr. Raduenz mention , large retrofit for energy saving be expensive . project that be take on by the university need to be able to pay for themselves within an acceptable period of time . currently the electricity and natural gas for academic building be deliver to the physical plant where it be meter and convert to a useful form and distribute . the energy use of each building be unknown and therefore make it difficult to quantify retrofitting project . sub-metering be a tool that can be use in the plan process to alleviate the quantification problem . sub-meters measure the incoming load to each building and additional sub-meters be install to segregate certain area or system in the building . operational system , ventilation for example , can be sub-metered to determine the load require to run the building separate from ancillary energy use such as light and outlet . lighting and electronics that run on outlet can be replace without extensive retrofitting . efficiency of light and electronics be commonly know and can be compare to energy star appliance require simple calculation eliminate the need to further sub-meter them . once the building be sub-metered , facility management would be able to locate area with seemingly high energy consumption . this would apply to operational system as well as ancillary energy use . facility management may be unaware of all the equipment use on campus and could locate old less efficient appliance that need replacement . the operational system that be identify as highly consumptive can be compare to similar system allow approximation of saving to be calculate . a prioritized list of project would then be available after comparison be do . detailed renovation and retrofitting cost should be complete before start a project to determine if an adequate payback be possible . if the project advance to completion , sub-metering would be able to confirm the saving . the benefit of sub-metering extend beyond its use in the retrofitting process . trend in increase energy consumption can be identify and the problem could be avert with preventative maintenance . failure in the system could also be identify dispatch the proper resource for a rapid response . in do so it would minimize energy loss and disruption in the system that could halt the operation of the university . sub-metering do require investment into equipment and maintenance . sub-metering electricity with two sub-meters per building would cost between $ @card@ and $ @card@ . the cost of steam or condensate sub-meters vary greatly with the size of the pipe . monthly maintenance include calibrate the meter to ensure accuracy ( energy star , @card@ ) . wind power it be apparent that physical and social factor limit significant gain in energy efficiency . therefore , our group recommend that the university should go to the next level of energy sustainability , and install a wind turbine . a wind turbine be recommend because among all of the renewable method of generate electricity , wind power be currently the most efficient , effectively compete with coal and natural gas ( cec , @card@ ) . for the fiscal year of july @card@ to June @card@ , all campus function with the exception of housing consume @card@ , @card@ , @card@ kilowatt-hour ( kw-h ) of electricity at a cost of $ @card@ , @card@ . generate some or all of this electricity use wind power would reduce all type of air pollution associate with generate an equivalent amount of power use coal . use wind power over coal to generate electricity save about @card@ tonne of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) per gigawatt-hour of electricity generate ( white and kulcinski , @card@ ) . there would also be significant reduction in : nitrogen oxide ( nox ) , a component of photochemical smog , sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) , a component of acid rain , and mercury ( hg ) , a source of human , fish , bird and other wildlife toxicity , mercury build up in animal tissue and can affect the heart , brain and nervous system ( Schmitt , @card@ ) . one-third of the mercury in the u.s. come from coal-burning electric utility plant the campus would also be reduce its non-renewable fossil fuel consumption . all of these benefit would go a long way toward make the campus more sustainable . vesta wind system educational opportunity a wind turbine would also provide new educational opportunity . two professor , dr. john katers and dr. john stoll , along with many other , would enjoy create additional study opportunity base on a campus wind turbine that might include new course and graduate student project . topic of interest might include : wind turbine aerodynamics , blade material and stress , harmonic in blade and tower , how electrical generator generate electricity , difference between direct drive , gear box and induction turbine , wind turbine output datum log , datum log software , environmental impact study , site assessment ( geography , topography ) , air mass and turbulence . other area school and college might also appreciate these opportunity as well . demand charge consider a commercial entity , the university be bill for peak and off-peak electricity consume as well as for a " demand charge . " the demand charge represent the amount owe for the maximum amount of power require during any fifteen minute period and be bill on a per peak kilowatt basis . the demand charge for a typical summer month , when air conditioning requirement be high , be about @card@ percent of typical billing charge . our group look for way to reduce the demand charge . one way that may hold promise for the future be to use off-peak power to generate hydrogen that would be store and then feed into a fuel cell during peak demand period . the fuel cell convert the hydrogen back to electricity at the time it be most need and most expensive . however , telephone conversation with gary shubach at ballard power system ( a manufacturer of fuel cell ) and wind energy expert , mick sagrillo , indicate that although there be some experimental project , fuel cell system be not yet reliable enough for this application . scope , assumption and limit condition the good opportunity for wind power appear to be in reduce the kilowatt-hour consumption portion for the bill . there should also be strong consideration for reduce co2 , even though the financial benefit of reduce greenhouse gas may not directly accrue to the university . to this end , this report focus primarily on a benefit-cost analysis of the installation of a general electric @card@ megawatt ( mw ) utility-scale wind turbine . a turbine this large be select because , be one of the large utility-scale machine , it would make a significant impact on the utility-grid electricity consumption of the university . a small turbine , a @card@ kw vesta v-17 , be also evaluate . however , our group feel that a small turbine should only be consider as a " back-up " project , because while it would still provide a basis for educational opportunity , it would not significantly reduce the grid electricity consumption of the university . in addition to the selection of this particular wind turbine , the scope of this project include several assumption and limit condition : wind . the campus be locate in a u.s. department of energy , class @card@ wind area . ( the class range from @card@ - the low to @card@ - the high in wind energy potential . ) wind turbine in a class @card@ wind area can expect to operate at @card@ percent efficiency per mick sagrillo . this be slightly less than the @card@ percent efficiency estimate for another class @card@ area utility-scale project in colorado ( lehr , et . al . , @card@ ) in area with great wind potential , such as the dakotas and minnesota , efficiency of @card@ percent or more can be expect ( Carleton , @card@ ) . for this report , we will err on the conservative side and select @card@ percent . a wind energy site assessment be recently complete by amy taivalkoski ( @card@ ) , an independent consultant . her approach to wind variability be different in that she estimate the average wind speed for the various potential site on campus and use a commercial spread sheet program to calculate reduction in the manufacturer ' rate output ( in kw ) for their various turbine model . whether estimate turbine efficiency base on experience with similar turbine in similar location or estimate average wind speed , both approach require professional opinion and judgment , and due to the high variability of wind , both approach use reduce or more conservative number . as state in the taivalkoski report , " a @card@ mph increase in the wind speed change the payback time by @card@ year ! " ( page @card@ ) . aside from this discussion , it be beyond the scope of this study to analyze which approach be more accurate . cost for wind turbine . accord to Mick sagrillo , the installed cost for the ge @card@ mw turbine be about $ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , and the installed cost for the vesta v-17 be about $ @card@ , @card@ . however , he also state that these price be subject to their availability , and in recent year , demand from europe and elsewhere have cause price to start to increase . in addition , the exact location on campus will affect the amount of wiring and other infrastructure need at the installation , and more precise price will require proposal from wind installation company . therefore , the $ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and $ @card@ , @card@ be consider approximate price . discount and inflation rate . there be two type of discount rate : a nominal discount rate that be not adjust to remove the effect of inflation , and a real discount rate , one that have be adjust to remove the effect of inflation . a nominal discount rate of @card@ percent be select for this analysis , because it be recommend by the European wind energy association ( morthorst , @card@ ) and be similar to the @card@ percent rate use in the afore-mentioned colorado project . with inflation at @card@ percent ( consumer price index for September @card@ ) , the real discount rate be @card@ percent ( @card@ minus @card@ ) . to avoid double accounting for inflation , the real discount rate be apply to annual maintenance cost and annual benefit . it could be argue that we should be use the consumer price index energy rate for the energy saving achieve by the wind turbine . however , lately , the energy rate have be high than the overall index , but the volatility of the energy rate could add significant error to long-term calculation . maintenance cost . Mick sagrillo , amy taivolkoski and replaced-dns , a wind industry website that provide financial tool to evaluate potential wind project , all suggest that maintenance cost be about one percent per year . electricity saving . the electricity saving be a blend rate of on-peak and off-peak charge as show on the july @card@ utility bill . as mention , this be discount use the @card@ percent rate . it should also be note that a wind turbine will be reduce the campus electricity consumption . there will not be excess electricity to sell back to the utility , unless large or multiple turbine be install . this be why the blend rate of actual charge be apply , rather than a " buyback " rate , as suggest in the wind energy site assessment report . economic life . this be the life expectancy or period at which the turbine be expect to generate electricity . this be typically @card@ to @card@ year for a wind turbine . the turbine at california ' S altamont pass be still function after @card@ year , and other project use @card@ year in their calculation ( eere , @card@ ) . however , manufacturer ' warrantee be typically less than that , which lead us to believe that @card@ year be more appropriate . utility and tax incentive . be a state-owned facility , the university do not qualify for the same incentive that benefit homeowner and private business . such incentive might include a production tax credit , cash-back award or low-interest loan .

( Owen , @card@ ) . fortunately , the consensus among people who have study actual wind turbine project be that the concern about bird be exaggerate . the draft environmental impact statement by the u.s. army corp of engineer for the cape wind energy project , nantucket sound , massachusetts ( army corp , @card@ ) include a comprehensive literature review of wind project around the u.s. on the issue of bird . this report conclude that " [ t ] he number of bird fatality at the u.s. site review be low , with the exception of the altamont pass site in california where collision of diurnal raptor have be report . " the report go on to say that : " the altamont pass site have a large number and high density of turbine ... the altamont pass site have close spacing of turbine ... the altamont pass site have perch site for raptor on turbine ( lattice tower or accessible work platform ) ... the altamont pass site have highly dissect topography , with turbine place on steep hillside ... " in addition , the altamont pass site have vertical spindle turbine that rotate close to the ground . this technology be no longer use . on the issue of bird migration , the report state that " migrant be typically find at high elevation , " and that migrant tend not to fly in weather with poor visibility reduce the possibility of collision with the turbine . bird mortality by wind turbine be miniscule compare to other hazard . on this issue , our group conclude that , because we be consider only one turbine , of a solid tower design , that there would be a minimum impact on bird ( see fig . 1 ) . fig . @ord@ bird mortality rate datum from pasqualetti , m . ; Johnson , g . bat : the wind ' s ability to generate electricity without many of the environmental impact associate with other energy source ( air pollution , water pollution , mercury emission , and greenhouse gas emission associate with global climate change ) can significantly benefit all species . nowadays , wind farm be become more commonplace all over the world . although provide a clean source of electrical power , these structure have the potential to kill both bird and bat . to understand the relationship of wind turbine and bird and bat mortality , the national wind coordinate committee ( nwcc ) wildlife workgroup , which be a part of the unite state department of agriculture , be form in @card@ ( national , @card@ ) . the initial purpose be to provide a forum for dialogue among researcher , conservationist , wind industry representative , and federal , state and local official . the workgroup have produce a report that summarize the current knowledge about bird and bat-wind interaction ( sagrillo , @card@ ) . the interaction of bat with wind turbine be , like many other behavior that bat exhibit , not well understand . one of these report , ` ` synthesis and comparison of baseline avian and bat use , raptor nest , and mortality information from propose and exist wind development , ' ' by west , Inc. , release December , @card@ , conclude that ` ` bat collision mortality during the breeding season be virtually non-existent , despite the fact that relatively large number of bat specie have be document in close proximity to wind plant . these datum suggest that wind plant do not currently impact resident breed population where they have be study in the u.s. ' ' ( sagrillo , @card@ ) . moreover , the buffalo ridge report also come to the follow conclusion : the wind plant probably do not impact bat breed population in the project area , and preliminary datum indicate that the population of bat susceptible to turbine collision be large enough that the observed mortality be not sufficient to cause population decline ( Johnson , @card@ ) . the study conclude by put a number on the bat mortality that range from @card@ to @card@ bat fatality per turbine , depend on location of the wind farm . the kewaunee county report come up with similar result . over the two-year span of that study , researcher document @card@ bat fatality per turbine per year ( Howe , @card@ ) . adjust for possible sampling error could bring this number as high as @card@ bat fatality per turbine per year ( sagrillo , @card@ ) . like the other study , the kewaunee county report find that the bulk of those kill by the wind turbine , over @card@ % , be migrate bat , not resident breeding population , and no endanger or threaten specie have be involve . we do know that many bat , like bird , die due to collision with lighthouse , communication tower , tall building , power line , and fence . nevertheless , as with bird , the number of fatality due to wind turbine be extremely low compare to collision with other man-made structure ( Johnson , @card@ ) . wind power and bird / bat population can and do coexist . vesta wind system aesthetics : the issue of aesthetics be very personal . some people consider wind turbine to be an eyesore , whereas other find them pleasing . this variation of opinion make an appraisal of a view difficult at good , and in wisconsin , there have be no appraisal conduct to determine the impact of wind turbine on property value . our group feel that people should appreciate the great environmental benefit of wind power over the less tangible benefit of a view . while there be legitimate concern about bird , aesthetics and other issue , " [ t ] hese issue be often use as " straw man ' to mask other , less noble objection such as the desire not to mar a view shed , prevent the competition from a new renewable source of electricity and just the simple desire not to have these huge piece of equipment " in my backyard . ' " ( duke university , @card@ ) we highly recommend that the university proceed with the installation of a @card@ mw wind turbine . the politic al and financial implication of wind energy interview : in order to gather more information about the logistic and politics of install a wind turbine on campus , a number of interview be conduct . les Raduenz be the facility manager at the university of wisconsin green bay and he offer a number of insight regard the installation of a wind turbine on campus . in addition , he provide a tour of the university ' s power plant and explain in more detail why the power plant require the great amount of energy as compare to any other building on campus . namely , he explain how there be little incentive for the university to conserve energy throughout the year because of the way that the university pay for natural gas . they do not pay for natural gas on a monthly basis . instead they participate in fuel bidding whereby they forecast the amount of natural gas they will use throughout the year and purchase that amount for the entire year . however , if the university use more or less than the amount set aside for them , it incur penalty charge . this be because the natural gas supplier have set aside the gas for the university ' S use and would be unable to sell it to another potential customer . therefore , there be a strong incentive for the university to consume the amount of natural gas that they originally purchase . additionally , Mr. Raduenz explain how it be difficult to monitor the energy use in individual room and building since there be a limited number of meter throughout campus . from an energy conservation standpoint , this make it difficult to identify which building be more efficient than other since multiple building run off the same thermostat . one solution would be to schedule night class in the same building rather than have them scatter throughout campus . since there be a limited number of student and faculty on campus during that time , the amount of heat go to the rest of campus could be lower . however , some faculty member have express that this would be a difficult task since they need the equipment in their respective building to teach class . a second interview be conduct with chip birch and john christiano from wisconsin public service corporation . chip birch be the renewable energy product manager and john christiano be the electric operation consultant for wisconsin public service . the purpose of the interview be to gain additional insight regard the logistic of install a wind turbine on campus . one issue of discussion be the issuance of rate charge . accord to mr. birch and mr. christiano , for any individual month the university be charge the peak demand rate that be achieve during that month for the entire month . therefore , the high amount of energy the university consume on any give day will determine the charge per kw-h for each day of the month . this concept be important for two reason . first , the ability of a wind turbine to offset energy cost be dependant upon peak energy cost . we can not calculate the cost saving on a day by day basis . rather , we need to compare the wind energy cost saving to the charge that would be incur during peak energy demand . furthermore , it bring up the issue of whether the university would be able to meet peak energy demand with a wind turbine , and if not , how the university would prepare to meet those energy need . since the wind turbine would not offset all of the energy need , the university would have to tap into current method of consuming energy via fossil fuel combustion . however , during time of low energy demand , it may be possible for electricity generate from the wind turbine to be bank and use at a late point in time , perhaps during peak energy demand , to help decrease the charge that would be apply for the entire month . another obstacle that mr. birch and mr. christiano identify be " behind the meter " installation . " behind the meter " mean that the wind turbine would be incorporate into the system after the meter that wisconsin public service use to charge the university . if it be install further upstream , " before the meter " , then the wind turbine would be consider wisconsin public service property . one problem that arise with install a large wind turbine , such as a @card@ mw wind turbine , " behind the meter " be that it require expensive equipment to wire into the university ' s electrical system since it be not intend to accept such large amount of electricity ( see fig . 2 ) . shape \ * mergeformat fig . @ord@ behind the meter schematic birch , c . and Christiano , j . lastly , mr. birch and Mr. Christiano suggest that the university install a @card@ kw wind turbine since they feel it would be easy to incorporate into the system . however , they feel the payback period for both the @card@ kw and @card@ mw wind turbine would be comparable . a third interview conduct with dr. dean rodeheaver and tom maki discuss the university ' s perspective on install a wind turbine . dr. rodeheaver be the assistant chancellor for planning and budget and professor of human development ( psychology ) and tom maki be the vice chancellor of business and finance . Dr. Rodeheaver and Mr. Maki bring up a number of issue . first , the university would only receive @card@ percent of the monetary profit realize from the wind turbine . this be because the state handle most of the budgeting and divide profit among other state university . they feel that this create a disincentive for the university to install a wind turbine if the money would not stay localize . a major concern be public perception of a wind turbine . both dr. rodeheaver and mr. maki be concern that install a wind turbine would deteriorate the relationship with the community . there have be past community concern regard the height of the Weidner center and the installation of the light at the soccer field . therefore , judge from past concern of the community , they feel that a wind turbine would create animosity with the surround resident . lastly , they be concern with have to perform an environmental impact statement which could lead to increase time , money , and energy . even though Dr. Rodeheaver and Mr. Maki be concern with these issue of install a wind turbine , they do feel that it be important to promote sustainability on campus . they suggest do an article in the fourth estate on the environmental heritage of the university . they would like to see a discussion about the past , present and future of environmental stewardship on this campus . they feel that a wind turbine could be a major contribution to the environmental theme of the university . they also suggest research other type of renewable energy source that be not as controversial as a wind turbine and the possibility of increase education about sustainability at freshman orientation . opportunity although these be valid concern , a number of opportunity may be realize through the installation of a wind turbine on campus . the wind turbine could provide educational opportunity and may help draw student wish to attend a university that promote sustainability and environmental stewardship . it may also create an incentive for more student to enroll if they see an opportunity to research renewable energy . this research could apply to the wind turbine along with the sustainable technique currently be apply to mary Ann cofrin hall . additionally , if other university be establish sustainability initiative and save money , the university of wisconsin green bay could potentially experience profit realize by those university as well . therefore , we may in effect benefit from gain make by other state university . one solution that dr. rodeheaver and Mr. Maki suggest be to install a wind turbine to supply the energy need for campus housing . this would be an opportunity to keep the profit localize since student housing energy bill be pay for by the student . this would help student directly see the outcome in their energy use and respective bill . it would also help student experience the benefit of use renewable energy . this would directly promote sustainable live practice throughout other venue of life as well . lastly , the wind turbine could symbolize sustainable living , if it be locate near campus housing . the energy bill : in September @card@ , the governor ' s energy task force be create by executive order in response to grow energy demand and concern for wisconsin ' s energy infrastructure ( Barth and grove , @card@ ) . the task force be to provide recommendation to the state regard the need to decrease energy demand . the key recommendation provide by the task force be to increase the statewide use of renewable energy by all customer to @card@ percent by @card@ , to increase the state of wisconsin ' S purchase of renewable energy to @card@ percent by @card@ , to improve the state ' s focus on energy efficiency program by increase the role of the public service commission in set target and funding level for energy efficiency , to update and improve the state ' s energy building code , and to create rural energy initiative like increase use of locally develop anaerobic digester and wind generator . currently , these recommendation have be incorporate into an energy bill for the state of wisconsin that be propose in November @ord@ if pass , this energy bill could generate more of an incentive for the university to install a wind generator or other source of renewable energy . some of the component of the propose energy bill include maintain the public benefit fund and use it for the purpose of promote renewable energy . currently , the public benefit fund have be raid to help balance the budget , and this bill would protect it from this practice . in the past , @card@ percent of this fund have be divert to balance the budget . therefore , the passage of the bill would result in an " increase " to the public benefit fund by @card@ percent which would lead to an increase in funding for renewable energy project such as a wind turbine on campus . the energy bill also propose that @card@ percent of all energy produce by utility be from renewable energy source by @ord@ this create an incentive for utility to purchase and build new source of wind power to meet this requirement from the state . this may create an incentive for a utility to purchase the wind turbine themselves and maintain it for our campus . another component of the energy bill that may affect university energy use be that it would require @card@ percent of all state building to be leed certify by @ord@ and university building would fall under the definition of a state building within the energy bill . the reason for this provision in the energy bill be that many feel that the state should lead by example in renewable energy use ( Stuart , @card@ ) . if pass , the energy bill would provide for great incentive and funding for the university to purchase a wind generator . a few source of funding for the wind turbine may be available for the university . one source of funding may be available through focus on energy . focus on energy be a public-private partnership offering energy information and service to residential , business , and industrial customer throughout wisconsin ( focus on energy ) . if the energy bill be pass , there would be a @card@ percent increase from past financial source for focus on energy to distribute to customer for renewable energy project . with a surge in funding , there may be an increase possibility for them to aid the university in purchase a wind turbine . utility may be another source of funding for a wind turbine . since utility be look to meet their renewable energy portfolio and may in the future be require to increase the amount of energy they produce from renewable energy source , an incentive may exist for them to support a wind turbine project at the university . finally , there may be private business throughout the local community look to improve their public relation . the university could partner with a local business in the venture . the private business could also take advantage of the production tax credit , which would allow for the business to receive tax break for purchase a wind turbine . currently , the production tax credit will be extend until @card@ ( Stuart , @card@ ) . geothermal heat pump and sustainable thermal energy production the increase expansion of approximately @card@ , @card@ student propose in the master plan will require the construction of new academic and residential building . heating and cooling will require significant expenditure in the construction , operation , and maintenance of the new facility . the heating and cool for exist academic building be do centrally at the physical plant use a natural gas boiler while dormitory and on-campus apartment use natural gas furnace to provide heat . student be allow to use window unit air conditioner for cool that run use electricity . thermal energy production and distribution on campus be currently reliant on fossil fuel such as natural gas and coal . new construction represent opportunity to break the dependence on fossil fuel and take a step toward a more sustainable campus . the use of geothermal heat pump for heat and cool of building be a sustainable option . geothermal system utilize the store energy of the earth to heat and cool building . electricity be still require to power the pump but if couple with a wind turbine , the system would produce no emission . use the earth as an energy source require a geothermal exchange field . the size of the field be directly proportional to the energy input require by the system to adequately heat and cool the facility . to reduce the surface area requirement the exchange field can be install vertically . accord to mike alf of van ' s refrigeration service inc. ( @card@ ) , every ton of system capacity require @card@ foot of bore hole and be typically drill up to @card@ foot allow approximately @card@ ton per bore hole . a minimum spacing of approximately fifteen foot between boreholes be require to eliminate the effect of neighboring bore hole . a ton of capacity can provide heat and cool for approximately @card@ square foot of academic space ( rogers , @card@ ) and @card@ square foot for residential space ( Rafferty , @card@ ) . these be estimate for traditional building and the square foot service by ton could be increase use green construction practice . the capital cost of a geothermal system be high than a conventional system . this be especially true for academic building on this campus because only an expansion to the cool system would be needed ( Raduenz , @card@ ) . an approximate cost of a vertical geothermal heat pump system provide by john rogers ( @card@ ) of vyron corporation be $ @card@ , @card@ per ton of capacity . for a residential building the cost per square foot be approximately $ @card@ and for an academic building it be approximately $ @card@ per square foot . a major portion of the cost of the system be the exchange field . the use of a vertical exchange field add approximately $ @card@ per ton to the cost . this come out to an additional $ @card@ per square foot for residential building and $ @card@ per square foot for the academic building . another major cost of the system along with boring be the tubing use for the circulation of the fluid in the exchange field . the tubing use be pvc and be a petroleum product . the cost of the tube increase as oil price increase . the volatility of oil price result in the fluctuation of system installation cost ( clary , @card@ ) . the capital cost of geothermal system may seem prohibitive . however , the capital cost be usually offset by reduce operation and maintenance cost within a half a year to five year of operation with most system see a payback within three year ( fhp , @card@ ) . for the operation of a residential system , @card@ percent saving can be expect over a conventional natural gas hvac system that be @card@ percent efficient ( clary , @card@ ) . bloomquist ( @card@ ) estimate operation cost of a vertical geothermal system base on case study for @card@ site to be around $ @card@ per square meter per year in an academic building . this be a savings of @card@ percent over a traditional natural gas system . the major energy requirement of the system be the pump . typically a @card@ horsepower pump be require for every @card@ ton of cool capacity . energy star ® pump be available and variable speed pump can have eer rating of up to @ord@ geothermal heat pump system in commercial building be usually force air system require motor . general electric manufacture electrical computated motor ( ecm ) that identify different air requirement throughout the system and maintain the air movement as need . this be more efficient than a typical motor that force air at a sustained flow regardless of the actual flow need because the ecm run less often use less electricity ( clary , @card@ ) reduce service and maintenance cost also contribute to the quick payback of geothermal system . when the total service and maintenance cost of existing system be distribute throughout the life of the system , the system save on average @card@ cent per square foot per year ( cane et al , @card@ ) . the service and maintenance cost of the system be an average of @card@ system survey by the author . the cost be compare to average service and maintenance cost provide in the American society of heating , refrigerate , and air conditioning engineer manual . reduce cost be attribute to the simplicity of the system . less equipment be need in a geothermal system than a conventional system . economy of scale on campus may reduce this benefit in academic building because only one physical plant be require for multiple building . the heating and cool of future building be an area that the university can improve the sustainability of the campus while decrease the cost of operation . geothermal heat pump rely on the store energy of the earth instead of fossil fuel and when couple with wind energy produce no emission . while the initial cost of the system be high , a payback can be expect within five year due to reduce operation and maintenance cost . geothermal heat pump should be consider for new building construction . conservation education as the campus move towards sustainability , energy conservation need to be an integral part of the process along with renewable energy . currently energy conservation education be limit to a few paragraph and bullet point on the university of wisconsin-green bay ' S ( @card@ ) web page and the effectiveness be proportionate to the importance give to it . energy conservation education can be a minimal cost investment to reduce energy consumption on the university of wisconsin-green bay campus . the behavior learn and practice while on campus will hopefully have reach off campus as well , in term of the student ' S home and influence on other . energy conservation education be need because new student come to this campus annually without ever have to think about the expense and environmental ramification of the electricity and natural gas that power and heat their home . while on campus , the economic cost of energy be hide in a fix fee every student pay at the beginning of the semester regardless of the energy waste . only during a crisis , be the urgency of energy conservation be realize , whether it be the first energy bill the student receive while live on his / her own or an economic shortfall in the state and school budget . the ub green program at the state university of new york at buffalo be consider one of the top campus environmental program in the unite state . in a report by irt environment Inc. ( @card@ ) , ub green identify the key to a successful energy conservation education program as awareness and participation . awareness provide the reason energy conservation be necessary , especially as it relate to sustainability , and also set out strategy use to achieve energy conservation . participation be the follow through . the complexity of an energy conservation education program can vary but should start out be simple and progress in complexity and extent as it gain support from the student as well as the university . education can start with campus resident at floor meeting at the beginning of the academic year . strategy for achievement should be affix ( so they can ' t be remove or throw out ) in the resident ' room and in heavily traffic area . faculty and staff should also be involve in conservation education through departmental meeting and have strategy affix in office . along with the strategy for achieve energy conservation , energy bill for each building should also be post . student would finally be able to see the economic cost of energy use . to emphasize the effect of energy consumption and the importance of work towards sustainability , resident should calculate the environmental and social cost base on the energy the building consume . energy cost should remain post as a way to compare energy use between month , season , and year and use as an indicator of progress . the university of wisconsin-green bay ' S ( @card@ ) web page on energy conservation stress the effect of energy consumption on economics and resource depletion , include coal and oil . the web site do not express its concern for the environmental and societal impact of energy consumption and send the wrong message to the student read it . the website should immediately be change to include the environmental and social consequence ( see fig . 3 ) . global warming fossil fuel burning produce greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide ( @card@ % increase in atmospheric co2 in the past @card@ year ) . lead to atmospheric warming and global climate change -

@card@ report terminology
certain term be use frequently throughout this report . table @card@ define these term . an understanding of the distinction between " sound " and " noise " may be particularly useful to the reader .
table @card@

definition of acoustical term
term sound definition describe wave-like variation in air pressure that occur at frequency that can stimulate receptor in the inner ear and , if sufficiently powerful , be appreciate at a conscious level . imply the presence of sound but also imply a response to sound : noise be often define as unwanted sound . the composite of noise from all source near and far . the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a give location . a unit describe the amplitude of sound , equal to @card@ time the logarithm to the base @card@ of the ratio of the measure pressure to the reference pressure , which be @card@ micropascals ( µpa ) . the sound pressure level in decibel as measure on a sound level meter use the a-weighted filter network . the a-weighted filter de-emphasize the very low and very high frequency component of the sound in a manner similar to the frequency response of the human ear and correlate well with subjective reaction to noise . a unit of measurement of frequency ; the number of cycle per second of a periodic waveform . accord to the international electrotechnical commission ' S ( iec ' S ) iec @card@ , infrasound be : acoustic oscillation whose frequency be below the lowfrequency limit of audible sound ( about @card@ hz ) . however this definition be incomplete as infrasound at high enough level be audible at frequency below @card@ hz . ( iec ( @card@ ) : @card@ : @card@ international electrotechnical vocabulary chapter @card@ : acoustics and electroacoustics ) . low-frequency sound source : hpa , @ord@ sound in the frequency range that overlap the high infrasound frequency and the low audible frequency , and be typically consider as @card@ hz to @card@ hz , but be not closely define .

@card@ the human ear and sound
the human ear be capable of perceive a wide range of sound , from the high-pitched sound of a bird song to the low-pitched sound of a bass guitar . sound be perceive base on their loudness ( i.e. . , volume or sound pressure level ) or pitch ( i.e. . , tonal or frequency content ) . the standard unit of measure for sound pressure level be the decibel ( db ) . the standard unit use to describe the tonal or frequency content be the hertz ( hz ) , measure in cycle per second ) - appendix a provide more information on the fundamental of sound . customarily , the young , non-pathological ear can perceive sound range from @card@ hz to @card@ , @card@ hz . appendix b provide more information on the human ear . frequency below @card@ hz be commonly call " infrasound , " although the boundary between infrasound and low frequency sound be not rigid . infrasound , at certain frequency and at high level , can be audible to some people . low frequency sound be customarily refer to as that between @card@ hz and @card@ hz , but any definition be arbitrary to some degree . low frequency sound be the subject of concern to some with respect to potential health implication .

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

table @card@ show sound pressure level associate with common activity . typically , environmental and occupational sound pressure level be measure in decibel on an a-weighted scale ( dba ) . the a-weighted scale de-emphasize the very low and very high frequency component of the sound in a manner similar to the frequency response of the human ear . for comparison , the sound from a wind turbine at distance between @card@ , @card@ and @card@ , @card@ foot be generally within @card@ to @card@ dba . section @card@ discuss the effect of exposure to wind turbine sound . section @card@ describe the potential adverse effect of sound exposure as well as the health implication .

@card@ sound produce by wind turbine
wind turbine sound originate from either a mechanical or aerodynamic generation mechanism . mechanical sound originate from the gearbox and control mechanism . standard noise control technique typically be use to reduce mechanical sound . mechanical noise be not typically the dominant source of noise from modern wind turbine ( except for an occasional gear tone ) . the aerodynamic noise be present at all frequency , from the infrasound range over low frequency sound to the normal audible range and be the dominant source . the aerodynamic noise be generate by several mechanism as be describe below . the aerodynamic noise tend to be modulate in the mid frequency range , approximately @card@ to @card@ , @card@ hz . aerodynamic sound be produce by the rotation of the turbine blade through the air . a turbine blade shape be that of an airfoil . an airfoil be simply a structure with a shape that produce a lift force when air pass over it . originally develop for aircraft , airfoil shape have be adapt to provide the turn force for wind turbine by employ a shape which cause the air to travel more rapidly over the top of the airfoil than below it . the design optimize efficiency by minimize turbulence , which produce drag and noise . an aerodynamically efficient blade be a quiet one . the aerodynamic sound from wind turbine be cause by the interaction of the turbine blade with the turbulence produce both adjacent to it ( turbulent boundary layer ) and in its near wake ( see figure @card@ ) ( brook et al . , @card@ ) . turbulence depend on how fast the blade be move through the air . a 100-meter-diameter blade , rotate once every three second , have a tip velocity of just over @card@ meter per second . however , the speed reduce at position close to the centre of rotation ( the wind turbine hub ) . the main determinant of the turbulence be the speed of the blade and the shape and dimension of its cross-section .

figure @card@

sound produce by wind turbine flow

the follow conclusion have be derive from the flow condition show in figure @card@ ( brook et al . , @card@ ) : • at high velocity for a give blade , turbulent boundary layer develop over much of the airfoil . sound be produce when the turbulent boundary layer pass over the trail edge . at low velocity , mainly laminar boundary layer develop , lead to vortex shedding at the trail edge .

•

other factor in the production of aerodynamic sound include the following : • • • • when the angle of attack be not zero - in other word , the blade be tilt into the wind - flow separation can occur on the suction side near to the trail edge , produce sound . at high angle of attack , large-scale separation may occur in a stall condition , lead to radiation of low frequency sound . a blunt trail edge lead to vortex shedding and additional sound . the tip vortex contain highly turbulent flow .

each of the above factor may contribute to wind turbine sound production . measurement of the location of the sound source in wind turbine indicate that the dominant sound be produce along the blade - near to the tip end than to the hub . reduction of turbulence sound can be facilitate through airfoil shape and by good maintenance . for example , surface irregularity result from damage or to accretion of additional material , may increase the sound .

@card@

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

aerodynamic sound have be show to be generate at high level during the downward motion of the blade ( i.e. . , the three o ' clock position ) . this result in a rise in level of approximately once per second for a typical three-bladed turbine . this periodic rise in level be also refer to as amplitude modulation , and as describe above for a typical wind turbine , the modulation frequency be @card@ hz ( once per second ) . in other word , the sound level rise and fall about once per second . the origin of this amplitude modulation be not fully understand . it be previously assume that the modulation be cause when the blade go past the tower ( give the tower disturb the airflow ) , but it be now think to be relate to the difference in wind speed between the top and bottom of the rotation of a blade and directivity of the aerodynamic noise ( oerlemans and schepers , @card@ ) . in other word , the result of aerodynamic modulation be a perceivable fluctuation in the sound level of approximately once per second . the frequency content of this fluctuate sound be typically between @card@ hz and @card@ , @card@ hz , but can occur at high and low frequency . that be , the sound pressure level between approximately @card@ and @card@ , @card@ hz will rise and fall approximately once per second . it should be note , however , that the magnitude of the amplitude modulation that be observe when stand beneath a tower do not always occur at great separation distance . a study in the unite kingdom ( Uk ) also show that only four out of about @card@ wind farm have a problem with aerodynamic modulation and three of these have be solve ( moorhouse et al . , @card@ ) . in addition to the sound level generate by the turbine , environmental factor affect the level receive at more distant location . for example , warm air near the ground cause the turbine sound to curve upwards , away from the ground , which result in reduce sound level , while warm air in a temperature inversion may cause the sound to curve down to the earth result in increase sound level . wind may also cause the sound level to be great downwind of the turbine - that be , if the wind be blow from the source towards a receiver - or low , if the wind be blow from the receiver to the source . most modeling technique , when properly implement , account for moderate inversion and downwind condition . attenuation ( reduction ) of sound can also be influence by barrier , ground surface condition , shrubbery and tree , among other thing . prediction of the sound level at vary distance from the turbine be base on turbine sound power level . these turbine sound power level be determine through standardized measurement method .

@card@ sound measurement and audiometric testing
a sound level meter be a standard tool use in the measurement of sound pressure level . as describe in section @card@ , the standard unit of sound pressure level ( i.e. . , volume ) be db and the standard unit use to describe the pitch or frequency be hz ( cycle per second ) . a sound level meter may use the a-weighting filter to adjust certain frequency range ( those that human detect poorly ) , result in a reading in dba ( decibel , a-weighted ) . appendix c provide more information on the measurement of sound . the pitch or frequency ( sometimes refer to as sound level spectrum ) can be quantify use a sound level meter that include a frequency analyzer . octave band , one-third octave band , and narrow band ( such as fast fourier transform , or fft ) be three common type of frequency analyzer .

@card@

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

consider , for example , a routine audiometric test ( hearing test ) in which a person sit in a booth and wear headphones , through which sound be transmit to evaluate hearing . outside the booth , a technician turn a dial which yield certain frequency ( for example , @card@ hz , a low-pitched sound , or @card@ , @card@ hz , a high-pitched sound ) and then the technician raise the volume of each frequency until the person recognize the sound of each tone . this be a standard approach use to measure threshold for many reason , include noiseinduced hearing loss ( nihl ) . as the technician raise the volume of the designate frequency , the sound level ( in db ) be note . people who need more than @card@ db at more than one frequency to hear the sound ( ie loudness of the tone ) be consider to have an abnormal test . the effect of prolonged , high-level sound exposure on hearing have be determine through audiometric test of worker in certain occupation . the study have be publish in major medical journal and subject to the peer review process ( see , for example , mccunney and Meyer , @card@ ) . study of worker have also serve as the scientific basis for regulation on noise in industry that be oversee by the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) . worker in noise-intensive industry have be evaluate for nihl and certain industry be know to be associate with high noise level , such as aviation , construction , and area of manufacturing such as canning . multiyear worker study suggest that prolonged exposure to high noise level can adversely affect hearing . the level consider sufficiently high to cause hearing loss be considerably high than one could experience in the vicinity of wind turbine . for example , prolonged , unprotected high exposure to noise at level great than @card@ dba be a risk for hearing loss in occupational setting such that osha establish this level for hearing protection . sound level from wind turbine do not approach these level ( @card@ dba at a distance of @card@ , @card@ foot would be a conservative estimate for today ' S turbine ) . although the issue of nihl have rarely be raise in opposition to wind farm , it be important to note that the risk of nihl be directly dependent on the intensity ( sound level ) and duration of noise exposure and therefore it be reasonable to conclude that there be no risk of nihl from wind turbine sound . such a conclusion be base on study of worker expose to noise and among whom risk of nihl be not apparent at level less than @card@ dba .

@card@ sound exposure from wind turbine operation
this section address the question of ( 1 ) whether sound in the low frequency range , most notably the infrasonic range , adversely affect human health , and whether they do so even when such level be below the average person ' s ability to hear them ; ( 2 ) what we be refer to when we talk about vibration ; and ( 3 ) how the human vestibular system respond to sound and disturbance .

@card@ infrasound and low-frequency sound
infrasound and low frequency sound be address in some detail to offer perspective on publicized hypothesis that sound from a wind turbine may damage health even if the noise level be below those associate with noise-induced hearing loss in industry . for example , it have be propose that sound that contain low frequency noise , most notably within the infrasonic level , can adversely affect health even when the level be below the average person ' s ability to detect or hear them ( alves-pereira and Branco , 2007b ) .

@card@

comprehensive review of infrasound and its source and measurement have be publish ( Berglund and lindvall , @card@ ; leventhall et al . , @card@ ) . table @card@ show the sound pressure level , in decibel , of the corresponding frequency of infrasound and low frequency sound necessary for the sound to be hear by the average person ( leventhall et al . , @card@ ) .

note : average hearing threshold ( for young healthy people ) in the infrasound ( @card@ to @card@ hz ) and low frequency region ( @card@ to @card@ hz ) . source : leventhall et al . , @card@

as table @card@ indicate , at low frequency , a much high level sound be necessary for a sound to be hear in comparison to high frequency . for example , at @card@ hz , the sound must be at @card@ db to be audible . if this level occur at the mid to high frequency , which the ear detect effectively , it would be roughly equivalent to stand without hearing protection directly next to a power see . decibel for decibel , the low frequency be much more difficult to detect than the high frequency , as show in the hearing threshold level of table @card@ . table @card@ also show that even sound as low as @card@ hz can be hear if the level be high enough ( @card@ db ) . however , level from wind turbine at @card@ hz be more likely to be around @card@ db or low , and therefore inaudible . study conduct to assess wind turbine noise have show that wind turbine sound at typical distance do not exceed the hearing threshold and will not be audible below about @card@ hz ( hayes 2006b ; kamperman and james , @card@ ) . the hearing threshold level at @card@ hz be @card@ db , as show in table @card@ . recent work on evaluate a large number of noise source between @card@ hz and @card@ hz suggest that wind turbine noise hear indoors at typical separation distance be modest on the scale of low frequency sound source ( Pedersen , @card@ ) . the low level of infrasound and low frequency sound from wind turbine operation have be confirm by other ( Jakobsen , @card@ ; van den berg , @card@ ) . the low frequency sound associate with wind turbine have attract attention recently since the a-weighting scale that be use for occupational and environmental regulatory compliance do not work well with sound that have prominently low frequency component . most environmental low frequency sound problem be cause by discrete tone ( pitch or tone that be significantly high in level ( volume ) than the neighboring frequency ) ; from , for example , an engine or compressor , not by continuous broadband sound . the high frequency sound be assess by the a-weighted measurement and , give their short wavelength , be control more readily . low frequency sound may be irritate to some people and , in fact , some low frequency sound complaint prove impossible to resolve ( leventhall et al . , @card@ ) . this observation lead to a perception that there be something special , sinister , and harmful about low frequency sound . to the contrary , most external sound when hear indoors be bias towards low frequency due to the efficient building attenuation of high frequency . one may recognize this when noise

from a neighbor ' S stereo be hear within their home - the bass note be more pronounce than the high frequency sound . any unwanted sound , whether high frequency or low frequency , can be irritate and stressful to some people . difference in how a low frequency sound and high frequency sound be perceive be well document . figure @card@ show that lower-frequency sound typically need to be at a high sound pressure level ( db ) to be hear . figure @card@ also demonstrate that as the frequency lower , the audible range be compress lead to a more rapid rise in loudness as the level change in the low frequency . at @card@ , @card@ hz , the whole range cover about @card@ db change in sound pressure level , while at @card@ hz the same range of loudness cover about @card@ db ( note the contour display in figure @card@ be in term of phon , a measure of equal loudness ; for additional explanation on phon , the reader be refer to http : / / replaced-dns / sonicstudio / handbook / replaced-dns [ truax , @card@ ] ) . as the annoyance of a give sound increase as loudness increase , there be also a more rapid growth of annoyance at low frequency . however , there be no evidence for direct physiological effect from either infrasound or low frequency sound at the level generate from wind turbine , indoors or outside . effect may result from the sound be audible , but these be similar to the effect from other audible sound . low frequency sound and infrasound be further address in section @card@ , potential adverse effect of exposure to sound .

@card@ vibration
vibration , assume to result from inaudible low frequency sound , have be postulate to have a potential adverse effect on health . this section define vibration , describe how it be measure , and cite study that have address the risk of vibration on health . vibration refer to the way in which energy travel through solid material , whether steel , concrete in a bridge , the earth , the wall of a house or the human body . vibration be distinguish from sound , which be energy flow through gas ( like air ) or liquid ( like water ) . as high frequency vibration attenuate rapidly , it be low frequency which be of potential concern to human health . when vibration be detect through the foot or through the seat , the focus of interest be the vibration of the surface with which one be in contact - for example , when travel in a vehicle . vibration be often measure by the acceleration of the surface in meter per second , square ( m / s2 ) , although other related unit be use . vibration can also be express in decibel , where the reference excitation level use in building be often @card@ - 5m / s2 and the vibration level be 20log ( a / @card@ ) db , where a be the acceleration level in m / s2 . the threshold of perception of vibration by human be approximately @card@ m / s2 . if a frequency of excitation ( vibration ) correspond with a resonant frequency of a system , then

excitation at the resonant frequency be great than at other frequency . however , excitation by sound be not the same as excitation by mechanical excitation apply at , say , the foot . figure @card@ show an object excite by point mechanical vibration and by sound . the object contain a resiliently suspend system . for example , if the object be the body , the suspend system might be the viscera ( internal organ of the body ) . the leave hand of the figure can be interpret as the body vibrate by input to the foot . the vibration of the viscera will be maximum at the resonant frequency1 of the suspend system , which , for viscera , be about @card@ hz . when excitation be by long wavelength low frequency sound wave , as show at the right of the figure , not only be the force act on the body much small than for vibration input , but , as the wavelength be much great than the dimension of the body , it be act around the body in a compressive manner so that there be no resultant force on the suspend system and it do not vibrate or resonate .

comparison of excitation of an object by vibration and by sound

unfortunately , this lack of effect have not be address by those who have suggest the mechanical vibration response of the body instead of the acoustic response as a potential health consequence . this oversight have lead to inaccurate conclusion . for example , Dr. Nina Pierpont base one of her key hypothesis for the cause of " wind turbine syndrome " on such an egregious error ( Pierpont , @card@ , pre-publication draft ) . although not a recognize medical diagnosis , " wind turbine syndrome " have be raise as a concern for propose project - refer to section @card@ for more information . vibration of the body by sound at one of its resonant frequency occur only at very high sound level and be not a factor in the perception of wind turbine noise . as will be discuss

below , the sound level associate with wind turbine do not affect the vestibular or other balance system .

@card@ vestibular system
the vestibular system of the body play a major role in maintain a person ' s sense of balance and the stabilization of visual image . the vestibular system respond to pressure change ( sound pressure , i.e. . , decibel ) at various frequency . at high level of exposure to low frequency sound , nausea and change in respiration and blood pressure may occur . study have show , however , that for these effect to occur , considerably high noise level ( great than @card@ db , similar in sound level of a jet aircraft hear @card@ foot away ) be necessary ( Berglund et al . , @card@ ) . head vibration result from low frequency sound have be suggest as a possible cause of a variety of symptom that some hypothesize as be associate with wind turbine . in order to properly assess this hypothesis , this section address the human vestibular system . the " vestibular system " comprise the sense organ in the vestibular labyrinth , in which there be five tiny sensory organ : three semicircular canal that detect head rotation and two chalk-crystal-studded organ call otolith ( literally " ear-stones " ) that detect tilt and linear motion of the head . all five organ contain hair cell , like those in the cochlea , that convert motion into nerve impulse travel to the brain in the vestibular nerve . these organ evolve million of year before the middle ear . fish , for example , have no middle ear or cochlea but have a vestibular labyrinth nearly identical to ours ( baloh and honrubia , @card@ ) . the vestibular organ be specialize for stimulation by head position and movement , not by airborne sound . each vestibular organ be firmly attach to the skull , to enable them to respond to the slight head movement . in contrast , the hair cell in the cochlea be not directly attach to the skull ; they do not normally respond to head movement , but to movement of the inner ear fluid . the otolith organ help fish hear low frequency sound ; even in primate , these organ will respond to head vibration ( i.e. . , bone-conducted sound ) at frequency up to @card@ hz ( Fernandez and Goldberg , @card@ ) . these vibratory response of the vestibular system can be elicit by airborne sound , however , only when they be at a much high level than normal hearing thresholds2 ( and much high than level associate with wind turbine exposure ) . thus , they do not help us hear but appear to be vestige of our evolutionary past . the vestibular nerve send information about head position and movement to center in the brain that also receive input from the eye and from stretch receptor in the neck , trunk , and
@card@ young et al . ( @card@ ) find that neuron come from the vestibular labyrinth of monkey respond to head vibration at frequency of @card@ hz , and at level as low as @card@ to @card@ db below gravitational force . however , these neuron could not respond to airborne sound at the same frequency until level exceed @card@ db sound pressure level ( spl ) , which be at least @card@ db high than the normal threshold of human hearing in this frequency range . human eye movement respond to @card@ hz head vibration at level @card@ db below audible level ( todd et al . , 2008a ) . this do not mean that the vestibular labyrinth be more sensitive than the cochlea to airborne sound , because the impedance-matching function of the middle ear allow the cochlea to respond to sound that be @card@ db less intense than those necessary to cause detectable head vibration . indeed , the same author ( todd et al . , 2008b ) find that for airborne sound , response from the cochlea could always be elicit by sound that be below the threshold for vestibular response . similarly , welgampola et al . ( @card@ ) find that threshold for vestibular evoke myogenic potential response ( vemp ) be high than hearing threshold and state : " the difference between hearing threshold and vemp threshold be much great for air conduct sound than for bone vibration . " in other word , the vestigial vestibular response to sound be relatively sensitive to bone conduction , which involve vibration of the whole head , and much less sensitive to air conduction .

leg ( these stretch receptor tell which muscle be contract and which joint be flex , and provide the " proprioceptive " sense of the body ' S position and orientation in space ) . the brain integrate vestibular , visual , and proprioceptive input into a comprehensive analysis of the position and movement of the head and body , essential for the sense of balance , avoidance of fall , and keep the eye focus on relevant target , even during movement . perception of the body ' s position in space may also rely in part on input from receptor in abdominal organ ( which can shift back and forth as the body tilt ) and from pressure receptor in large blood vessel ( blood pool in the leg when stand , then shift back to the trunk when lie down ) . these " somatic graviceptors " ( Mittelstaedt , @card@ ) could be activate by whole-body movement and possibly by structure-borne vibration , or by the blast of a powerful near explosion , but , as describe in section @card@ , it be unlikely that intraabdominal and intra-thoracic organ and blood vessel could detect airborne sound like that create by wind turbine . trauma , toxin , age-related degeneration , and various ear disease can cause disorder of the vestibular labyrinth . a labyrinth not function properly can cause a person to feel unsteady or even to fall . since the semicircular canal of the ear normally detect head rotation ( such as shake the head to indicate " no " ) , one of the consequence of a dysfunctional canal be that a person may feel a " spinning " sensation . this reaction be describe as vertigo , from the Latin word to turn . in normal conversation , word like vertigo and dizziness can be use in ambiguous way and thus make careful interpretation of potential health claim problematic . " dizzy , " for example , may mean true vertigo or unsteadiness , both of which may be symptom of inner ear disease . a person who describe be " dizzy " may actually be experience light-headedness , a fainting sensation , blur vision , disorientation , or almost any other difficult-to-describe sensation in the head . the word " dizziness " can represent different sensation to each person , with a variety of cause . this can make the proper interpretation of research study in which dizziness be evaluate a challenge to interpret . proper diagnostic testing to evaluate dizziness can reduce error in misclassifying disease . the vestibular labyrinth , for example , can be test for postural stability . information from the semicircular canal be feed to the eye muscle to allow us to keep our eye focus on a target ; when the head move ; this " vestibulo-ocular reflex " be easily test and can be impair in vestibular disorder ( baloh and honrubia , @card@ ) .

@card@ potential adverse effect of exposure to sound
adverse effect of sound be directly dependent on the sound level ; high frequency sound present a great risk of an adverse effect than low level ( see table @card@ ) . speech interference , hearing loss , and task interference occur at high sound level . soft sound may be annoy or cause sleep disturbance in some people . at normal separation distance , wind turbine do not produce sound at level that cause speech interference , but some people may find these sound to be annoy .

@card@ speech interference
it be common knowledge that conversation can be difficult in a noisy restaurant ; the louder the background noise , the louder we talk and the hard it be to communicate . average

@card@

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

level of casual conversation at @card@ meter ( arm ' S length ) be typically @card@ to @card@ dba . people raise their voice - slightly and unconsciously at first - when ambient level exceed @card@ to @card@ dba , in order to keep speech level slightly above background noise level . communication at arm ' S length require conscious extra effort when level exceed about @card@ dba . above ambient level of @card@ to @card@ dba , people need to shout or get closer to converse ( pearsons et al . , @card@ ; webster , @card@ ) . level below @card@ dba can be consider irrelevant with respect to speech interference .

@card@ noise-induced hearing loss
very brief and intense sound ( above @card@ dba , such as in explosion ) can cause instant cochlear damage and permanent hearing loss , but most occupational nihl result from prolonged exposure to high noise level between @card@ and @card@ dba ( mccunney and Meyer @card@ ) . regulatory ( osha , @card@ ) and advisory ( niosh , @card@ ) authority in the u.s. concur that risk of nihl begin at about @card@ dba , for an 8-hour day , over a 40-year career . level below @card@ dba do not pose a risk of nihl . thus , the sound level associate with wind turbine operation would not cause nihl because they be not high enough .

@card@ task interference
Suter ( @card@ ) review the effect of noise on performance and behavior . simple task may be unaffected even at level well above @card@ dba , while more complex task can be disrupt by intermittent noise as low as @card@ dba . speech sound be usually more disruptive than nonspeech sound . level below @card@ dba do not result in task interference .

@card@ annoyance
annoyance as a possible " effect " of wind turbine operation be discuss in detail in late section of this report ( section @card@ and @card@ ) . in summary , annoyance be a subjective response that vary among people to many type of sound . it be important to note that although annoyance may be a frustrating experience for people , it be not consider an adverse health effect or disease of any kind . certain everyday sound , such as a drip faucet - barely audible - can be annoy . annoyance can not be predict easily with a sound level meter . noise from airport , road traffic , and other source ( include wind turbine ) may annoy some people , and , as describe in section @card@ , the louder the noise , the more people may become annoyed .

@card@ sleep disturbance
the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) document title information on level of environmental noise requisite to protect public health and welfare with an adequate margin of safety ( @card@ ) recommend that indoor day-night-level ( dnl ) not exceed @card@ dba . dnl be a 24-hour average that give @card@ db extra weight to sound occur between 10p.m . and @card@ a.m. , on the assumption that during these sleep hour , level above @card@ dba indoors may be disruptive .

@card@ other adverse health effect of sound

perforation be common ) but also the lung and intestine ( sasser et al . , @card@ ) . at the other extreme , any sound that be chronically annoy , include very soft sound , may , for some people , create chronic stress , which can in turn lead to other health problem . on the other hand , many people become accustom to regular exposure to noise or other potential stressors , and be no longer annoyed . the hypothesis that chronic noise exposure might lead to chronic health problem such as hypertension and heart disease have be the subject of hundred of contradictory study of highly variable quality , which will not be review in this document . other author have review this literature , and some of their conclusion be quote below : " it appear not likely that noise in industry can be a direct cause of general health problem ... , except that the noise can create condition of psychological stress ... which can in turn cause physiological stress reaction ... " ( kryter , @card@ ) " epidemiological evidence on noise exposure , blood pressure , and ischemic heart disease be still limit . " ( babisch , @card@ ) , and " contradictory ' ( babisch , @card@ ) , but " there be some evidence ... of an increase risk in subject who live in noisy area with outdoor noise level of great than @card@ - @card@ dba . " ( babisch , @card@ ) " the present state of the art do not permit any definite conclusion to be draw about the risk of hypertension . " ( van dijk , ettema , and zielhuis , @card@ ) " at this point , the relationship between noise induce hearing loss and hypertension must be consider as possible but lacking sufficient evidence to draw causal association .

people may experience vibration when some part of the body be in direct contact with a vibrate object . one example would be hold a chainsaw or pneumatic hammer in the hand . another would be sit in a bus , truck , or on heavy equipment such as a bulldozer . chronic use of vibrate tool can cause " hand-arm vibration syndrome , " a vascular insufficiency condition characterize by numbness and tingle of the finger , cold intolerance , " white-finger " attack , and eventually even loss of finger due to inadequate blood supply . osha do not set limit for vibration exposure , but the American national standard institute ( ansi ) ( @card@ ) recommend that 8-hour workday exposure to hand-arm vibration ( @card@ to @card@ hz , sum over three orthogonal axe of movement ) not exceed acceleration value of @card@ m / s2 . excessive whole-body vibration be clearly link to low back pain ( wilder , wasserman , and Wasserman , @card@ ) and may contribute to gastrointestinal and urinary disorder , although these association be not well establish . ansi ( @card@ ) recommend 8-hour limit for whole-body vibration of @card@ m / s2 , for the body ' s most sensitive frequency range of @card@ to @card@ hz . this be about @card@ time more intense than the weak vibration that people can detect ( @card@ m / s2 ) . airborne sound can cause detectable body vibration , but this occur only at very high level - usually above sound pressure level of @card@ db ( unweighted ) ( smith , @card@ ; Takahashi et al . , @card@ ; Yamada et al . , @card@ ) . there be no scientific evidence to suggest that modern wind turbine cause perceptible vibration in home or that there be an associated health risk .

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

@card@ peer-reviewed literature focus on wind turbine , low-frequency sound , and infrasound
this section address the scientific review of the literature that have evaluate wind turbine , the annoyance effect , low frequency sound , and infrasound .

@card@ evaluation of annoyance and dose-response relationship of wind turbine sound
to date , three study in europe have specifically evaluate potential health effect of people live in proximity to wind turbine ( pedersen and persson waye , @card@ ; pedersen and persson waye , @card@ ; Pedersen et al . , @card@ ) . these study have be primarily in Sweden and the netherlands . customarily , an eligible group of people be select for possible participation in the study base on their location with respect to a wind turbine . control group have not be include in any of these report . in an article publish in august @card@ , investigator report the result of their evaluation of @card@ people in the netherlands , who live in the vicinity of wind turbine ( Pedersen et al . , @card@ ) . the potential study population consist of approximately @card@ , @card@ people live within @card@ kilometer of a wind turbine at selected site in the netherlands . the objective of the study be to ( 1 ) assess the relationship between wind turbine sound level at dwelling and the probability of noise annoyance , take into account possible moderate factor , and ( 2 ) explore the possibility of generalize a dose response relationship for wind turbine noise by compare the result of the study with previous study in Sweden . noise impact be quantify base on the relationship between the sound level ( dose ) and response with the latter measure as the proportion of people annoy or highly annoy by sound . prior to this study , dose response curve have be model for wind turbine . previous study have note different degree of relationship between wind turbine sound level and annoyance ( wolsink et al . , @card@ ; pedersen and persson waye , @card@ ; pedersen and persson waye , @card@ ) . subjective response be obtain through a survey . the calculation of the sound level ( dose ) in Sweden and the netherlands be similar . a dose response relationship be observe between calculated a-weighted sound pressure level and annoyance . sound from wind turbine be find to be more annoy than several other environmental source at comparable sound level . a strong correlation be also note between noise annoyance and negative opinion of the impact of wind turbine on the landscape , a finding in early study as well . the dominant quality of the sound be a swish , the quality previously find to be the most annoy type . the author conclude that this study could be use for calculate a dose response curve for wind turbine sound and annoyance . the study result suggest that wind turbine sound be easily perceive and , compare with sound from other source , be annoy to a small percentage of people ( @card@ percent at @card@ to @card@ dba ) . in this study , the proportion of people who report be annoy by wind turbine noise be similar to merged datum from two previous Swedish study ( pederson and persson

Pedersen et al . also report significant dose response between wind turbine sound and self-reported annoyance ( pedersen and persson waye , @card@ ) . high exposed individual respond more ( @card@ percent ) than low expose individual ( @card@ percent ) , which suggest that bias could have play a role in the final result . an analysis of two cross-sectional socio-acoustic study - one that address flat landscape in mainly rural setting ( pedersen and persson waye , @card@ ) and another in different terrain ( complex or flat ) and different level of urbanization ( rural or suburban ) ( pedersen and persson waye , @card@ ) - be perform ( Pedersen , @card@ ) . approximately @card@ percent of over @card@ people survey via a questionnaire report be very annoy at sound level of @card@ db and great . attitude toward the visual impact of the wind turbine have the same effect on annoyance . response to wind turbine noise be significantly relate to exposure express as a-weighted sound pressure level db . among those who could hear wind turbine sound , annoyance with wind turbine noise be highly correlate to the sound characteristic : swish , whistle , resound and pulsate / throb ( Pedersen , @card@ ) . a similar study in Sweden evaluate @card@ people live near one of seven site where wind turbine power be great than @card@ kilowatt ( kw ) ( pedersen and persson waye , @card@ ) . annoyance be correlate with sound level and also with negative attitude toward the visual impact of the wind turbine . note that none of these study include a control group . earlier field study perform among people live in the vicinity of wind turbine show a correlation between sound pressure level and noise annoyance ; however , annoyance be also influence by visual factor and attitude toward the impact of the wind turbine on the landscape . noise annoyance be note at low sound pressure level than annoyance from traffic noise . although some people may be affect by annoyance , there be no scientific evidence that noise at level create by wind turbine could cause health problem ( pedersen and högskolan , @card@ ) .

@card@ annoyance
a feeling describe as " annoyance " can be associate with acoustic factor such as wind turbine noise . there be considerable variability , however , in how people become " annoyed " by environmental factor such as road construction and aviation noise , among other ( leventhall , @card@ ) . annoyance be clearly a subjective effect that will vary among people and circumstance . in extreme case , sleep disturbance may occur . wind speed at the hub height of a wind turbine at night may be up to twice as high as during the day and may lead to annoyance from the amplitude modulate sound of the wind turbine ( van den berg , @card@ ) . however , in a study of @card@ site in @card@ European country , only a weak correlation be note between sound pressure level and noise annoyance from wind turbine ( pedersen and högskolan , @card@ ) . in a detailed comparison of the role of noise sensitivity in response to environmental noise around international airport in Sydney , London , and amsterdam , it be show that noise sensitivity increase one ' s perception of annoyance independently of the level of noise exposure ( van Kamp et al . , @card@ ) .

@card@

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

in a Swedish study , @card@ out of @card@ , @card@ people live in the vicinity of a wind turbine in @card@ geographical area reported be fairly or very annoy by wind turbine ( Pedersen , @card@ ) . it be important to note that no difference be report among people who be " annoy " in contrast to those who be not annoy with respect to hearing impairment , diabetes , or cardiovascular disease . an early study in Sweden show that the proportion of people " annoy " by wind turbine sound be high than for other source of environmental noise at the same decibel level ( pedersen and persson waye , @card@ ) .

@card@ low-frequency sound and infrasound
no scientific study have specifically evaluate health effect from exposure to low frequency sound from wind turbine . natural source of low frequency sound include wind , river , and waterfall in both audible and non-audible frequency . other source include road traffic , aircraft , and industrial machinery . the most common source of infrasound be vehicular ( national toxicology program , @card@ ) . infrasound at a frequency of @card@ hz ( the upper limit of infrasound ) be not detectable at level low than than @card@ db ( leventhall et al . , @card@ ) . infrasound at @card@ db at @card@ hz and at @card@ db at @card@ hz can stimulate the auditory system and cause severe pain ( leventhall , @card@ ) .these noise level be substantially high than any noise generate by wind turbine . the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) have approve the use of infrasound for therapeutic massage at @card@ db in the @card@ to @card@ hz range ( national toxicology program , @card@ ) . in light of the fda approval for this type of therapeutic use of infrasound , it be reasonable to conclude that exposure to infrasound in the @card@ db range be safe . accord to a report of the national research council ( nrc ) , low frequency sound be a concern for old wind turbine but not the modern type ( national research council , @card@ ) .

@card@

section @card@

result
this section discuss the result of the anaylsis present in section @ord@ potential effect from infrasound , low frequency sound , and the fluctuate aerodynamic " swish " from turbine blade be examine . propose hypothesis between wind turbine sound and physiological effect in the form of vibroacoustic disease , " wind turbine syndrome , " and visceral vibratory vestibular disturbance be discuss .

@card@ infrasound , low-frequency sound , and annoyance
sound level from wind turbine pose no risk of hearing loss or any other nonauditory effect . in fact , a recent review conclude that " occupational noise-induced hearing damage do not occur below level of @card@ dba . " ( ising and Kruppa , @card@ ) the level of sound associate with wind turbine operation be considerably low than industry level associate with noise induce hearing loss . however , some people attribute certain health problem to wind turbine exposure . to make sense of these assertion , one must consider not only the sound but the complex factor that may lead to the perception of " annoyance . " most health complaint regard wind turbine have center on sound as the cause . there be two type of sound from wind turbine : mechanical sound , which originate from the gearbox and control mechanism , and the more dominant aerodynamical sound , which be present at all frequency from the infrasound range over low frequency sound to the normal audible range . infrasound from natural source ( for example , ocean wave and wind ) surround us and be below the audible threshold . the infrasound emit from wind turbine be at a level of @card@ to @card@ db , sometimes high , but well below the audible threshold . there be a consensus among acoustic expert that the infrasound from wind turbine be of no consequence to health . one particular problem with many of these assertion about infrasound be that be that the term be often misuse when the concern sound be actually low frequency sound , not infrasound . under many condition , low frequency sound below about @card@ hz can not be distinguish from environmental background sound from the wind itself . perceptible ( mean above both the background sound and the hearing threshold ) , low frequency sound can be produce by wind turbine under condition of unusually turbulent wind condition , but the actual sound level depend on the distance of the listener from the turbine , as the sound attenuate ( fall off ) with distance . the high the frequency , the great the sound attenuate with distance - appendix d provide more information on the propagation of sound . the low frequency sound emit by spin wind turbine could possibly be annoy to some when wind be unusually turbulent , but there be no evidence that this level of sound could be harmful to health . if so , city dwelling would be impossible due to the similar level of ambient sound level normally present in urban environment . nevertheless , a small number of people find city sound level stressful .

@card@

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

it be not usually the low frequency nonfluctuating sound component , however , that provoke complaint about wind turbine sound . the fluctuate aerodynamic sound ( swish ) in the @card@ to @card@ , @card@ hz range occur from the wind turbine blade disturb the air , modulate as the blade rotate which change the sound dispersion characteristic in an audible manner . this fluctuate aerodynamic sound be the cause of most sound complaint regard wind turbine , as it be hard to become accustomed to fluctuate sound than to sound that do not fluctuate . however , this fluctuation do not always occur and a Uk study show that it have be a problem in only four out of @card@ uk wind farm , and have be resolve in three of those ( moorhouse et al . , @card@ ) .

@card@ infrasound and low-frequency sound
infrasound occur at frequency less than @card@ hz . at low and inaudible level , infrasound have be suggest as a cause of " wind turbine syndrome " and vibroacoustic disease ( vad ) - refer to section @card@ for more information on vad . for infrasound to be hear , high sound level be necessary ( see section @card@ , table @card@ ) . there be little risk of short term acute exposure to high level of infrasound . in experiment relate to the apollo space program , subject be expose to between @card@ and @card@ db without know harmful effect . high level infrasound be less harmful than the same high level of sound in the normal audible frequency range . high level of low frequency sound can excite body vibration ( leventhall , @card@ ) . early attention to low frequency sound be direct to the u.s. space program , study from which suggest that 24-hour exposure to @card@ to @card@ db be tolerable below @card@ hz , the upper limit of infrasound . modern wind turbine produce sound that be assess as infrasound at typical level of @card@ to @card@ db , below the hearing threshold at those frequency ( Jakobsen , @card@ ) . Jakobsen conclude that infrasound from wind turbine do not present a health concern . fluctuation of wind turbine sound , most notably the swish-swish sound , be in the frequency range of @card@ to @card@ , @card@ hz , which be neither low frequency sound nor infrasound . the predominant sound from wind turbine , however , be often mischaracterized as infrasound and low frequency sound . level of infrasound near modern-scale wind farm be in general not perceptible to people . in the human body , the beat of the heart be at @card@ to @card@ hz . higher-frequency heart sound measure externally to the body be in the low frequency range ( @card@ to @card@ db at @card@ to @card@ hz ) , although the strong frequency be that of the heartbeat ( sakai , feigen , and luisada , @card@ ) . lung sound , measure externally to the body be in the range of @card@ to @card@ db at @card@ to @card@ hz ( fiz et al . , @card@ ) . schust ( @card@ ) have give a comprehensive review of the effect of high level low frequency sound , up to @card@ hz .

@card@ annoyance
annoyance be a broad topic on which volume have be write . annoyance can be cause by constant amplitude and amplitude modulate sound contain rumble ( Bradley , @card@ ) . as the level of sound rise , an increase number of those who hear it may become distressed , until eventually nearly everybody be affect , although to different degree . this be a clear and easily understand process . however , what be not so clearly understand be that when the level of the sound reduce , so that very few people be trouble by it , there remain a small number who may be adversely affect . this occur at all frequency , although there seem to be more subjective variability at the low frequency . the effect of low

@card@

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

frequency sound on annoyance have recently be review ( leventhall , @card@ ) . the standard deviation of the hearing threshold be approximately @card@ db at low frequency ( kurakata and mizunami , @card@ ) , so that about @card@ percent of the population will have @card@ db more sensitive hearing than the average person . however , hear sensitivity alone do not appear to be the decide factor with respect to annoyance . for example , the same type of sound may elicit different reaction among people : one person might say " yes , i can hear the sound , but it do not bother me , " while another may say , " the sound be impossible , it be ruin my life . " there be no evidence of harmful effect from the low level of sound from wind turbine , as experience by people in their home . study have show that people ' attitude toward wind turbine may affect the level of annoyance that they report ( Pedersen et al . , @card@ ) . some author emphasize the psychological effect of sound ( kalveram , @card@ ; kalveram et al . , @card@ ) . in an evaluation of @card@ people expose to five different wind turbine sound at @card@ db , rating of " annoyance " be different among different type of wind turbine noise ( Persson Waye and öhrström , @card@ ) . none of the psycho-acoustic parameter could explain the difference in annoyance response . another study of more than @card@ , @card@ people suggest that personality trait play a role in the perception of annoyance to environmental issue such as sound ( Persson et al . , @card@ ) . annoyance originate from acoustical signal that be not compatible with , or that disturb , psychological function , in particular , disturbance of current activity . kalveram et al . ( @card@ ) suggest that the main function of noise annoyance be as a warning that fitness may be affect but that it cause little or no physiological effect . protracted annoyance , however , may undermine cope and progress to stress related effect . it appear that this be the main mechanism for effect on the health of a small number of people from prolonged exposure to low level of noise . the main health effect of noise stress be disturbed sleep , which may lead to other consequence . work with low frequency have show that an audible low frequency sound do not normally become objectionable until it be @card@ to @card@ db above hearing threshold ( inukai et al . , @card@ ; Yamada , @card@ ) . an exception be when a listener have develop hostility to the noise source , so that annoyance commence at a low level . there be no evidence that sound at the level from wind turbine as hear in residence will cause direct physiological effect . a small number of sensitive people , however , may be stress by the sound and suffer sleep disturbance .

@card@ other aspect of annoyance
some people have conclude that they have health problem cause directly by wind turbine . in order to make sense of these complaint , we must consider not only the sound , but the complex factor culminate in annoyance . there be a large body of medical literature on stress and psychoacoustics . three factor that may be pertinent to a short discussion of wind turbine annoyance effect be the nocebo effect , sensory integration dysfunction and somatoform disorder .

@card@

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

@card@ nocebo effect
the nocebo effect be an adverse outcome , a worsening of mental or physical health , base on fear or belief in adverse effect . this be the opposite of the well know placebo effect , where belief in positive effect of an intervention may produce positive result ( Spiegel , @card@ ) . several factor appear to be associate with the nocebo phenomenon : expectation of adverse effect ; condition from prior experience ; certain psychological characteristic such as anxiety , depression and the tendency to somatize ( express psychological factor as physical symptom ; see below ) , and situational and contextual factor . a large range of reaction include hypervagotonia , manifest by idioventricular heart rhythm ( a slow heart rate of @card@ to @card@ beat per minute result from an intrinsic pacemaker within the ventricle which take over when normal sinoatrial node regulation be lose ) , drowsiness , nausea , fatigue , insomnia , headache , weakness , dizziness , gastrointestinal ( gi ) complaint and difficulty concentrate ( sadock and sadock , @card@ , p.2425 ) . this array of symptom be similar to the so-called " wind turbine syndrome " coin by Pierpont ( @card@ , pre-publication draft ) . yet these be all common symptom in the general population and no evidence have be present that such symptom be more common in person live near wind turbine . nevertheless , the large volume of medium coverage devote to alleged adverse health effect of wind turbine understandably create an anticipatory fear in some that they will experience adverse effect from wind turbine . every person be suggestible to some degree . the result stress , fear , and hypervigilance may exacerbate or even create problem which would not otherwise exist . in this way , anti-wind farm activist may be create with their publicity some of the problem that they describe .

@card@ somatoform disorder
there be seven somatoform disorder in the fourth edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder ( dsm-iv-tr ) ( American psychiatric association , @card@ ) . somatoform disorder be physical symptom which reflect psychological state rather than arise from physical cause . one common somatoform disorder , conversion disorder , be the unconscious expression of stress and anxiety as one or more physical symptom ( Escobar and Canino , @card@ ) . common conversion symptom be sensation of tingle or discomfort , fatigue , poorly localize abdominal pain , headache , back or neck pain , weakness , loss of balance , hearing and visual abnormality . the symptom be not feign and must be present for at least six month accord to dsm-iv-tr and two year accord to the international statistical classification of disease and related health problem , 10th revision ( icd-10 ) ( who , @card@ ) . icd-10 specify the symptom as belong to four group : ( 1 ) gastrointestinal ( abdominal pain , nausea , bloat / gas / , bad taste in mouth / excessive tongue coating , vomiting / regurgitation , frequent / loose bowel movement ) ; ( 2 ) cardiovascular ( breathlessness without exertion , chest pain ) ; ( 3 ) genitourinary ( frequency or dysuria , unpleasant genital sensation , vaginal discharge ) , and ( 4 ) skin and pain ( blotchiness or discoloration of the skin , pain in the limb , extremity or joint , paresthesia ) . icd-10 specify that at least six symptom must be present in two or more group . one feature of somatoform disorder be somatosensory amplification , a process in which a person learn to feel body sensation more acutely and may misinterpret the significance of those sensation by equate them with illness ( Barsky , @card@ ) . sensory integration dysfunction

describe abnormal sensitivity to any or all sensory stimulus ( sound , touch , light , smell , and taste ) . there be controversy among researcher and clinician as to whether sensory integration problem exist as an independent entity or as component of a pervasive developmental disorder ( sadock and sadock , @card@ , page @card@ ) , but their presence can lead to overestimation of the likelihood of be ill ( sadock and sadock , @card@ , page @card@ ) . sensory integration dysfunction as such be not list in the dsm-iv-tr or in the icd-10 . day-to-day stressors and adverse life event provide multiple stimulus to which people respond , and that response be often somatic due to catecholamine and activation of the autonomic nervous system . this stress response can become condition as memory . there be some evidence that poor cope mechanism ( anger impulsivity , hostility , isolation , lack of confide in other ) be link to physiological reactivity , which be associate with somatic sensation and amplification ( sadock and sadock , @card@ , page @card@ ) . in summary , the similarity of common human stress response and conversion symptom to those describe as " wind turbine syndrome " be striking . an annoyance factor to wind turbine sound undoubtedly exist , to which there be a great deal of individual variability . stress have multiple cause and be additive . associate stress from annoyance , exacerbate by the rhetoric , fear , and negative publicity generate by the wind turbine controversy , may contribute to the report symptom describe by some people live near rural wind turbine .

@card@ infrasound , low-frequency sound and disease
some report have suggest a link between low frequency sound from wind turbine and certain adverse health effect . a careful review of these report , however , lead a critical reviewer to question the validity of the claim for a number of reason , most notably ( 1 ) the level of sound exposure associate with the putative health effect , ( 2 ) the lack of diagnostic specificity associate with the health effect report , and ( 3 ) the lack of a control group in the analysis .

@card@ vibroacoustic disease
vibroacoustic disease ( vad ) in the context of exposure of aircraft engine technician to sound be define by Portuguese researcher as a whole-body , multi-system entity , cause by chronic exposure to large pressure amplitude and low frequency ( lpalf ) sound ( alvespereira and castelo branco , 2007a ; alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007b ; alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007c ; alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007d ) . vad , the primary feature of which be thicken of cardiovascular structure , such as cardiac muscle and blood vessel , be first note among airplane technician , military pilot , and disc jockey ( Maschke , @card@ ; castelo branco , @card@ ) . worker have be expose to high level for more than @card@ year . there be no epidemiological study that have evaluate risk of vad from exposure to infrasound . the likelihood of such a risk , however , be remote in light of the much low vibration level in the body itself . study of worker with substantially high exposure level have not indicate a risk of vad . vad have be describe as lead from initial respiratory infection , through pericardial thickening to severe and life-threatening illness such as stroke , myocardial infarction , and risk of malignancy ( alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007a ) .

@card@

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

@card@ high-frequency exposure
all of the exposure of subject for whom the vad concept be develop , be dominate by high frequency sound , a critical point since the frequency range claim for vadinducing sound be much wide than the frequency range of exposure experience by the aircraft technician who be diagnose with vad ( castelo branco , @card@ ) . originally , proponent of the vad concept have propose a " great than @card@ db " criterion for vad . however , now some claim that vad will result from exposure to almost any level of infrasound and low frequency sound at any frequency below @card@ hz . this assertion be an extraordinary extrapolation give that the concept of vad develop from observation that a technician , work around military aircraft on the ground , with engine operate , display disorientation ( castelo branco , @card@ ) . sound level near aircraft be very high . in an evaluation of typical engine spectra of carrier base combat aircraft operate on the ground , the spectra peak at frequency above @card@ hz with sound level from @card@ to @card@ db close to the aircraft ( smith , @card@ ) . the level drop considerably , however , into the low frequency region . there be an enormous decibel difference between the sound exposure of aircraft technician and the sound exposure of people who live near wind turbine . animal experiment indicate that exposure level necessary to cause vad be @card@ week of continuous exposure to approximately @card@ db of low frequency sound ( Mendes et al . , @card@ ) . the exposure level be at least @card@ to @card@ db high than wind turbine level in the same frequency region ( hayes , 2006a ) .

@card@ residential exposure : a case series
extrapolation of result from sound level great than @card@ db and at predominantly high frequency ( great than @card@ hz ) to a risk of vad from inaudible wind turbine sound level of @card@ to @card@ db in the infrasound region , be a new hypothesis . one investigator , for example , have claim that wind turbine in residential area produce acoustical environment that can lead to the development of vad in nearby home-dwellers ( alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007a ) . this claim be base on comparison of only two infrasound exposure . the first be for a family which have experience a range of health problem and which also complain of disturbance from low frequency sound . the second be for a family which live near four wind turbine , about which they have become anxious ( alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007a ; alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007b ) . the first family ( family f ) , be expose to low level of infrasound consist of about @card@ db at @card@ hz and @card@ hz from a grain terminal about @card@ kilometer ( km ) away and additional source of low frequency sound , include a near railway line and road . the second family ( family r ) live in a rural area and be describe as expose to infrasound level of about @card@ db to @card@ db at @card@ hz to @card@ hz . these exposure be well below the hearing threshold and not uncommon in urban area . neither the frequency nor volume of the sound exposure experience by family f or r be unusual . exposure to infrasound ( < @card@ hz ) do not exceed @card@ db .

family f - exposure to low level of infrasound

family f have a long history of poor health and a 10-year-old boy be diagnose with vad due to exposure to infrasound from the grain terminal ( alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007a ; Castelo Branco et al . , @card@ ) . however , the infrasound level be well below hearing threshold and be typical of urban infrasound , which occur widely and to which many people be expose . accord to the author , the main effect of vad be demonstrate by the 10-year-old boy in the family , as pericardial thickening.3 however , the boy have a history of poor health of unknown etiology ( castelo Branco et al . , @card@ ) . castelo branco ( @card@ ) have define pericardial thickening as an indicator of vad and assume that the presence of pericardial thickening in the boy from family f must be an effect of vad , cause by exposure to the low-level , low frequency sound from the grain terminal . this assumption exclude other possible cause of pericardial thickening , include viral infection , tuberculosis , irradiation , hemodialysis , neoplasia with pericardial infiltration , bacterial , fungal , or parasitic infection , inflammation after myocardial infarction , asbestosis , and autoimmune disease . the author do not exclude these other possible cause of pericardial thickening .

family r - proximity to turbine and anxiety

family r , live close to the wind turbine , have low frequency sound exposure similar to that of family f . the family do not have symptom of vad , but it be claim that " family r . will also develop vad should they choose to remain in their home . " ( alvespereira and castelo branco , 2007b ) . in light of the absence of literature of cohort and case control study , this bold statement seem to be unsubstantiated by available scientific literature .

@card@ critique
it appear that family f and r be self-selected complainant . conclusion derive by alves-pereira and castelo branco ( 2007b ) have be base only on the poor health and the sound exposure of family f , use this single exposure as a measure of potential harmful effect for other . there have be no attempt at an epidemiological study . alves-pereira and castelo branco claim that exposure at home be more significant than exposure at work because of the long period of exposure ( alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007e ) . because an approximate @card@ db difference occur between the exposure from wind turbine and the exposure that induce vad ( hayes , 2006a ) , it will take @card@ year ( @card@ , @card@ year ) for the wind turbine dose to equal that of one year of the high level sound . among publish scientific literature , this description of the two family be know as a case series , which be of virtually no value in understand potential causal association between exposure to a potential hazard ( i.e. . , low frequency sound ) and a potential health effect ( i.e. . , vibroacoustic disease ) . case report have value but primarily in generate hypothesis to test in other study such as large group of people or in case control study . the latter type of study can systematically evaluate people with pericardial thickening who live near wind turbine in comparison to people with pericardial thickening who do not live

@card@

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

near wind turbine . case report need to be confirm in large study , most notably cohort study and case-control study , before definitive cause and effect assertion can be draw . the report of the two family do not provide persuasive scientific evidence of a link between wind turbine sound and pericardial thickening . wind turbine produce low level of infrasound and low frequency sound , yet there be no credible scientific evidence that these level be harmful . if the human body be affect by low , sub-threshold sound level , a unique and not yet discover receptor mechanism of extraordinary sensitivity to sound be necessary - a mechanism which can distinguish between the normal , relatively high-level " sound " inherent in the human body4 and excitation by external , low-level sound . essential epidemiological study of the potential effect of exposure at low sound level at low frequency have not be conduct . until the fuzziness be clarify , and a receptor mechanism reveal , no reliance can be place on the case report that the low level of infrasound and low frequency sound be a cause of vibroacoustic disease.5 the attribution of dangerous property to low level of infrasound continue unproven , as it have be for the past @card@ year . no foundation have be demonstrate for the new hypothesis that exposure to sub-threshold , low level of infrasound will lead to vibroacoustic disease . indeed , human evolution have occur in the presence of natural infrasound .

@card@ wind turbine syndrome
" wind turbine syndrome " as promote by Pierpont ( @card@ , pre-publication draft ) appear to be base on the follow two hypothesis : @ord@ low level of airborne infrasound from wind turbine , at @card@ to @card@ hz , directly affect the vestibular system . @ord@ low level of airborne infrasound from wind turbine at @card@ to @card@ hz enter the lung via the mouth and then vibrate the diaphragm , which transmit vibration to the viscera , or internal organ of the body . the combined effect of these infrasound frequency send confusing information to the position and motion detector of the body , which in turn lead to a range of disturbing symptom .

@card@ evaluation of infrasound on the vestibular system
consider the first hypothesis . the support for this hypothesis be a report apparently misunderstand to mean that the vestibular system be more sensitive than the cochlea to low level of both sound and vibration ( todd et al . , 2008a ) . the todd report be concern with vibration input to the mastoid area of the skull , and the corresponding detection of these vibrations by the cochlea and vestibular system . the low frequency use be @card@ hz ,
@card@ body sound be often use for diagnosis . for example see gross , v. , a . Dittmar , t . penzel , f . , schüttler , and page von Wichert . .

considerably high than the upper limit of the infrasound frequency ( @card@ hz ) . the report do not address air-conducted sound or infrasound , which accord to Pierpont excite the vestibular system by airborne sound and by skull vibration . this source do not support Pierpont ' S hypothesis and do not demonstrate the point that she be try to make . there be no credible scientific evidence that low level of wind turbine sound at @card@ to @card@ hz will directly affect the vestibular system . in fact , it be likely that the sound will be lose in the natural infrasonic background sound of the body . the second hypothesis be equally unsupported with appropriate scientific investigation . the body be a noisy system at low frequency . in addition to the beat heart at a frequency of @card@ to @card@ hz , the body emit sound from blood circulation , bowel , stomach , muscle contraction , and other internal source . body sound can be detect externally to the body by the stethoscope .

@card@ evaluation of infrasound on internal organ
it be well know that one source of sound may mask the effect of another similar source . if an external sound be detect within the body in the presence of internally generate sound , the external sound must produce a great effect in the body than the internal sound . the skin be very reflective at high frequency , although the reflectivity reduce at low frequency ( Katz , @card@ ) . investigation at very low frequency show a reduction of about @card@ db from external to internal sound in the body of a sheep ( peter et al . , @card@ ) . these result suggest an attenuation ( reduction ) of low frequency sound by the body before the low frequency sound reach the internal organ . low-level sound from outside the body do not cause a high enough excitation within the body to exceed the internal body sound . Pierpont refer to paper from takahashi and colleague on vibration excitation of the head by high level of external sound ( over @card@ db ) . however , these paper state that response of the head at frequency below @card@ hz be not measurable due to the mask effect of internal body vibration ( Takahashi et al . , @card@ ; Takahashi et al . , @card@ ) . when measure chest resonant vibration cause by external sound , the internal vibration mask resonance for external sound below @card@ db excitation level ( leventhall , @card@ ) . thus , the second hypothesis also fail . to recruit subject for her study , Pierpont send out a general call for anybody believe their health have be adversely affect by wind turbine . she ask respondent to contact her for a telephone interview . the case series result for ten family ( @card@ subject ) be present in Pierpont ( @card@ , pre-publication draft ) . symptom include sleep disturbance , headache , tinnitus , ear pressure , vertigo , nausea , visual blur , tachycardia , irritability , concentration , memory , panic attack , internal pulsation , and quiver . this type of study be know as a case series . a case series be of limited , if any , value in evaluate causal connection between an environmental exposure ( in this case , sound ) and a designate health effect ( so call " wind turbine syndrome " ) . this particular case series be substantially limit by selection bias , in which people who already think that they have be affect by wind turbine " self select " to participate in the case series . this approach introduce a significant bias in the result , especially in the absence of a control group who do not live in proximity of a wind turbine . the result of this case series be at good hypothesis-generating activity that do not provide support for a causal link between wind turbine sound and socalled " wind turbine syndrome . "

however , these so call " wind turbine syndrome " symptom be not new and have be publish previously in the context of " annoyance " to environmental sound ( Nagai et al . , @card@ ; møller and lydolf , @card@ ; mirowska and Mroz , @card@ ) . the follow symptom be base on the experience of noise sufferer extend over a number of year : distraction , dizziness , eye strain , fatigue , feel vibration , headache , insomnia , muscle spasm , nausea , nose bleed , palpitation , pressure in the ear or head , skin burn , stress , and tension ( leventhall , @card@ ) . the symptom be common in case of extreme and persistent annoyance , lead to stress response in the affected individual and may also result from severe tinnitus , when there be no external sound . the symptom be exhibit by a small proportion of sensitive person and may be alleviate by a course of psychotherapy , aim at desensitization from the sound ( leventhall et al . , @card@ ) . the similarity between the symptom of noise annoyance and those of " wind turbine syndrome " indicate that this " diagnosis " be not a pathophysiological effect , but be an example of the well-known stress effect of exposure to noise , as display by a small proportion of the population . these effect be familiar to environmental noise control officer and other " on the ground " professional . " wind turbine syndrome , " not a recognize medical diagnosis , be essentially reflective of symptom associate with noise annoyance and be an unnecessary and confusing addition to the vocabulary on noise . this syndrome be not a recognize diagnosis in the medical community . there be no unique symptom or combination of symptom that would lead to a specific pattern of this hypothesize disorder . the collective symptom in some people expose to wind turbine be more likely associate with annoyance to low sound level .

@card@ visceral vibratory vestibular disturbance
@card@ hypothesis
in addition to case report of symptom report by people who live near wind turbine , Pierpont have propose a hypothesis that purport to explain how some of these symptom arise : visceral vibratory vestibular disturbance ( vvvd ) ( Pierpont , @card@ , pre-publication draft ) . vvvd have be describe as consist of vibration associate with low frequency that enter the body and cause a myriad of symptom . Pierpont consider vvvd to be the most distinctive feature of a nonspecific set of symptom that she describe as " wind turbine syndrome . " as the name vvvd imply , wind turbine sound in the @card@ to @card@ hz spectral region be hypothesize to cause vibration in abdominal viscera ( e.g. . , intestine , liver , and kidney ) that in turn send neural signal to the part of the brain that normally receive information from the vestibular labyrinth . these signal hypothetically conflict with signal from the vestibular labyrinth and other sensory input ( visual , proprioceptive ) , lead to unpleasant symptom , include panic . unpleasant symptom ( especially nausea ) can certainly be cause by sensory conflict ; this be how scientist explain motion sickness . however , this hypothesis of vvvd be implausible base on knowledge of sensory system and the energy need to stimulate them . whether implausible or not , there be time-tested scientific method available to evaluate the legitimacy of any hypothesis and at this stage , vvvd as propose by Pierpont be an untested hypothesis . a case series of @card@ family recruit to participate in a study base on certain symptom would not be consider evidence of causality by research or policy institution such as the international agency for research on

cancer ( iarc ) or epa . as note earlier in this report , a case series of self-selected patient do not constitute evidence of a causal connection .

@card@ critique
receptor capable of sense vibration be locate predominantly in the skin and joint . a clinical neurological examination normally include assessment of vibration sensitivity . it be highly unlikely , however , that airborne sound at comfortable level could stimulate these receptor , because most of airborne sound energy be reflect away from the body . Takahashi et al . ( @card@ ) use airborne sound to produce chest or abdominal vibration that exceed ambient body level . this vibration may or may not have be detectable by the subject . takahashi find that level of @card@ db sound pressure level be require at @card@ to @card@ hz ( even high level would have be require at low and high frequency ) . sound like this would be consider by most people to be very loud , and be well beyond the level produce by wind turbine at residential distance . comparison of the response to low frequency airborne sound by normal hearing and profoundly deaf person have show that deaf subject can detect sound transmit through their body only when it be well above the normal hearing threshold ( Yamada et al . , @card@ ) . for example , at @card@ hz , the deaf person ' average threshold be @card@ db sound pressure level , @card@ db high than that of the hearing subject . it have also be show that , at high frequency , the body surface be very reflective of sound ( Katz , @card@ ) . similarly , work on transmission of low frequency sound into the body of sheep have show a loss of about @card@ db ( peter et al . , @card@ ) the visceral receptor invoke as a mechanism for vvvd have be show to respond to static gravitational position change , but not to vibration ( that be why they be call graviceptors ) . if there be vibration-sensitive receptor in the abdominal viscera , they would be constantly barrage by low frequency body sound such as pulsatile blood flow and bowel sound , while external sound would be attenuate by both the impedance mismatch and dissipation of energy in the overlie tissue . finally , wind turbine sound at realistic distance possess little , if any , acoustic energy , at @card@ to @card@ hz . it have be hypothesize that the vestibular labyrinth may be " abnormally stimulate " by wind turbine sound ( Pierpont , @card@ , pre-publication draft ) . as note in early section of this report , moderately loud airborne sound , at frequency up to about @card@ hz , can indeed stimulate not only the cochlea ( the hearing organ ) but also the otolith organ . this be not abnormal , and there be no evidence in the medical literature that it be in any way unpleasant or harmful . in ordinary life , most of us be expose for hour every day to sound louder than those experience at realistic distance from wind turbine , with no adverse effect . this assertion that the vestibular labyrinth be stimulate at level below hearing threshold be base on a misunderstanding of research that use bone-conducted vibration rather than airborne sound . indeed , those who wear bone conduction hearing aid experience constant stimulation of their vestibular system , in addition to the cochlea , without adverse effect .

@card@ interpret study and report
in light of the unproven hypothesis that have be introduce as reflective of adverse health effect attribute to wind turbine , it can be instructive to review the type of research study that can be use to determine definitive link between exposure to an environmental

hazard ( in this case , sound and vibration emission from wind turbine ) and adverse health effect ( the so-called " wind turbine syndrome " ) . how do we know , for example , that cigarette cause lung cancer and that excessive noise cause hearing loss ? almost always , the first indication that an exposure might be harmful come from the informal observation of doctor who notice a possible correlation between an exposure and a disease , then communicate their finding to colleague in case report , or report of group of case ( case series ) . these initial observation be usually uncontrolled ; that be , there be no comparison of the people who have both exposure and disease to control group of people who be either non-exposed or disease-free . there be usually no way to be sure that the apparent association be statistically significant ( as oppose to simple coincidence ) , or that there be a causal relationship between the exposure and the disease in question , without control subject . for these reason , case report and case series can not prove that an exposure be really harmful , but can only help to develop hypothesis that can then be test in controlled study ( Levine et al . , @card@ ; genovese , @card@ ; Mclaughlin , @card@ ) . once suspicion of harm have be raise , control study ( case-control or cohort ) be essential to determine whether or not a causal association be likely , and only after multiple independent-controlled study show consistent result be the association likely to be broadly accepted ( iarc , @card@ ) . case-control study compare people with the disease to people without the disease ( ensure as far as possible that the two group be well-matched with respect to all other variable that might affect the chance of have the disease , such as age , sex , and other exposure know to cause the disease ) . if the disease group be find to be much more likely to have have the exposure in question , and if multiple type of error and bias can be exclude ( Genovese , @card@ ) , a causal link be likely . multiple case-control study be necessary before the link between smoking and lung cancer could be prove . cohort study compare people with the exposure to well-matched control subject who have not have that exposure . if the expose group prove to be much more likely to have the disease , assume error and bias can be exclude , a causal link be likely . after multiple cohort study , it be clear that excessive noise exposure cause hearing loss ( mccunney and Meyer , @card@ ) . in the case of wind turbine noise and its hypothetical relationship to " wind turbine syndrome " and vibroacoustic disease , the weak type of evidence - case series - be available , from only a single investigator . these report can do no more than suggest hypothesis for further research . nevertheless , if additional and independent investigator begin to report adverse health effect in people expose to wind turbine noise , in excess of those find in unexposed group , and if some consistent syndrome or set of symptom emerge , this advice could change . thus , at this time , " wind turbine syndrome " and vvvd be unproven hypothesis ( essentially unproven idea ) that have not be confirm by appropriate research study , most notably cohort and case control study . however , the weakness of the basic hypothesis make such study unlikely to proceed .

@card@ standard for site wind turbine
@card@ introduction
while the use of large industrial-scale wind turbine be well establish in europe , the development of comparable wind energy facility in north america be a more recent occurrence . the growth of wind and other renewable energy source be expect to continue . opponent of wind energy development argue that the height and setback regulation establish in some jurisdiction be too lenient and that the noise limit which be apply to other source of noise ( either industrial or transportation ) be not sufficient for wind turbine for a variety of reason . therefore , they be concern that the health and well-being of some resident who live in the vicinity ( or close proximity to ) of these facility be threaten . critic maintain that wind turbine noise may present more than an annoyance to nearby resident especially at night when ambient level may be low . consequently , there be those who advocate for a revision of the existing regulation for noise and setback pertain to the site of wind installation ( kamperman and james , @card@ ) . some have indicate their belief that setback of more than @card@ mile may be necessary . while the primary purpose of this study be to evaluate the potential for adverse health effect rather than develop public policy , the panel do not find that setback of @card@ mile be warrant .

@card@ noise regulation and ordinance
in @card@ , epa publish a report that examine the level of environmental noise necessary to protect public health and welfare ( epa , @card@ ) . base on the analysis of available scientific datum , epa specify a range of day-night sound level necessary to protect the public health and welfare from the effect of environmental noise , with a reasonable margin of safety . rather than establish standard or regulation , however , epa simply identify noise level below which the general public would not be place at risk from any of the identify effect of noise . each federal agency have develop its own noise criterion for source for which they have jurisdiction ( i.e. . , the federal aviation administration regulate aircraft and airport noise , the federal highway administration regulate highway noise , and the federal energy regulatory commission regulate interstate pipeline ( bastasch , @card@ ) . state and local government be provide guidance by epa on how to develop their own noise regulation , but the establishment of appropriate limit be leave to local authority to determine give each community ' s differ value and land use priority ( epa , @card@ ) .

@card@ wind turbine site guideline
establish appropriate noise limit and setback distance for wind turbine have be a concern of many who be interested in wind energy . there be several approach to regulate noise , from any source , include wind turbine . they can generally be classify as absolute or relative standard or a combination of absolute and relative standard . absolute standard establish a fix limit irrespective of exist noise level . for wind turbine , a single absolute limit may be establish regardless of wind speed ( i.e. . , @card@ dba ) or different limit may be establish for various wind speed ( i.e. . , @card@ dba at @card@ meter per second [ m / s ] and @card@ dba at @card@ m / S ) . the ontario ministry of environment ( @card@ ) wind turbine noise guideline be an example of fix limit for each integer wind speed between @card@ and @card@ meter per second . relative standard limit the increase over exist level and may

@card@

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

also establish either an absolute floor or ceiling beyond which the relative increase be not consider . that be , for example , if a relative increase of @card@ dba with a ceiling of @card@ dba be allow and the existing level be @card@ dba , a level of @card@ dba would not be allow . similarly , if a floor of @card@ dba be establish and the existing level be @card@ dba , @card@ dba rather than @card@ dba would be allow . fix distance setback have also be discuss . critic of this approach suggest that fix setback do not take into account the number or size of the turbine nor do they consider other potential source of noise within the project area . it be clear that like many other source of noise , a uniform regulator approach for wind turbine noise have not be establish either domestically or internationally . a draft report title environmental noise and health in the uk , publish for comment in @card@ by the health protection agency ( hpa ) on behalf of an ad hoc expert group , provide insightful comment on the world health organization ' s noise guideline ( who , @card@ ) . the hpa draft report can be view at the follow address : http : / / replaced-dns / web / hpawebfile / hpaweb_c / @card@ the hpa report state the following : it be important to bear in mind that the who guideline value , like other who guideline , be offer to policymaker as a contribution to policy development . they be not intend as standard in a formal sense but as a possible basis for the development of standard . by way of overall summary , the @card@ npl report note [ a British report title health-based noise assessment method - a review and feasibility study ( porter et al . , @card@ ) as quote in hpa @card@ ] : the who guideline represent a consensus view of international expert opinion on the low noise level below which the occurrence rate of particular effect can be assume to be negligible . exceedances of the who guideline value do not necessarily imply significant noise impact and indeed , it may be that significant impact do not occur until much high degree of noise exposure be reach . the guideline form a start point for policy development . however , it will clearly be important to consider the cost and benefit of reduce noise level and , as in other area , this should inform the setting of objective . ( from : hpa , @card@ , page @card@ ) the hpa report further state the following : survey have show that about half of the Uk population life in area where daytime sound level exceed those recommend in the who community noise guideline . about two-third of the population live in area where the night-time guideline recommend by who be exceed . ( page @card@ ) that sleep can be affect by noise be common knowledge . define a dose-response curve that describe the relationship between exposure to noise and sleep disturbance have , however , prove surprisingly difficult . laboratory study and field study have generate different result . in part this be due to habituation to noise which , in the field , be common in many people . ( page @card@ ) our examination of the evidence relate to the effect of environmental noise on health have demonstrate that this be a rapidly develop area . any single report will , therefore , need to be revise within a few year . we conclude and recommend that an

independent expert committee to address these issue on a long-term basis be establish . ( page @card@ ) the statement cite above from the hpa and who document address general environmental noise concern rather than concern focus solely on wind turbine noise .

conclusion
many country have turn to wind energy as a key strategy to generate power in an environmentally clean manner . wind energy enjoy considerable public support , but it have its detractor , who have publicize their concern that the sound emit from wind turbine cause adverse health consequence . the objective of the panel be to develop an authoritative reference document for the use of legislator , regulator , and citizen simply want to make sense of the conflicting information about wind turbine sound . to this end , the panel undertake extensive review , analysis , and discussion of the peer-reviewed literature on wind turbine sound and possible health effect . the varied professional background of panel member ( audiology , acoustics , otolaryngology , occupational and environmental medicine , and public health ) be highly advantageous in create a diversity of informed perspective . participant be able to examine issue surround health effect and discuss plausible biological effect with considerable combined expertise . follow review , analysis , and discussion , the panel reach agreement on three key point : • • • there be nothing unique about the sound and vibration emit by wind turbine . the body of accumulate knowledge about sound and health be substantial . the body of accumulate knowledge provide no evidence that the audible or subaudible sound emit by wind turbine have any direct adverse physiological effect .

the panel appreciate the complexity involve in the varied human reaction to sound , particularly sound that modulate in intensity or frequency . most complaint about wind turbine sound relate to the aerodynamic sound component ( the swish sound ) produce by the turbine blade . the sound level be similar to the ambient noise level in urban environment . a small minority of those expose report annoyance and stress associate with noise perception . this report summarize a number of physical and psychological variable that may influence adverse reaction . in particular , the panel consider " wind turbine syndrome " and vibroacoustic disease , which have be claim as cause of adverse health effect . the evidence indicate that " wind turbine syndrome " be base on misinterpretation of physiologic datum and that the feature of the so-called syndrome be merely a subset of annoyance reaction . the evidence for vibroacoustic disease ( tissue inflammation and fibrosis associate with sound exposure ) be extremely dubious at level of sound associate with wind turbine . the panel also consider the quality of epidemiologic evidence require to prove harm . in epidemiology , initial case report and uncontrolled observation of disease association

wind turbine sound and health effect an expert panel review

need to be confirm through control study with case-control or cohort methodology before they can be accept as reflective of casual connection between wind turbine sound and health effect . in the area of wind turbine health effect , no case-control or cohort study have be conduct as of this date . accordingly , allegation of adverse health effect from wind turbine be as yet unproven . panel member agree that the number and uncontrolled nature of exist case report of adverse health effect allege to be associate with wind turbine be insufficient to advocate for fund further study . in conclusion : @ord@ sound from wind turbine do not pose a risk of hearing loss or any other adverse health effect in human . @ord@ subaudible , low frequency sound and infrasound from wind turbine do not present a risk to human health . @ord@ some people may be annoy at the presence of sound from wind turbine . annoyance be not a pathological entity . @ord@ a major cause of concern about wind turbine sound be its fluctuate nature . some may find this sound annoy , a reaction that depend primarily on personal characteristic as oppose to the intensity of the sound level .

appendix a

appendix a

fundamental of sound
the follow appendix provide additional background information on sound and how it be define . one atmospheric pressure be give by @card@ , @card@ pascal ( pa ) , where one pascal be one newton per square meter ( n / m2 ) , and a sound pressure of @card@ db re 20μpa be give by @card@ pa ( see later for decibel ) . the frequency of the fluctuation may be between @card@ time a second ( @card@ hz ) , and up to @card@ , @card@ time a second ( @card@ , @card@ hz ) for the " audible " noise . frequency below @card@ hz be commonly call " infrasound , " although there be a very fuzzy boundary between infrasound and low frequency noise . infrasound at high level be audible . low frequency noise might be from about @card@ hz to about @card@ hz . in addition to frequency , the quantity which define a sound wave include : • • • pressure , p wavelength , λ velocity , c = 340m / s approx , depend on temperature

the velocity and wavelength be relate by : velocity = wavelength x frequency , relate frequency and wavelength by velocity give freq hz @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@

wavelength @card@ m

low frequency have long wavelength . it be useful to develop an appreciation of frequency and related wavelength , since this help an understanding of noise propagation and control . sound pressure in a wave be force per unit of area of the wave and have unit of n / m2 , which be abbreviate to pa. the sound pressure fluctuate above and below atmospheric pressure by a very small amount . the sound power be a characteristic of the source , and be its rate of production of energy , express in watt . the sound power be the fundamental property of the source , whilst the sound pressure at a measurement location depend on the transmission path from source to receiver . most sound source , include wind turbine , be specify in term of their sound power . the sound power of a wind turbine be typically in the @card@ dba range , which be similar to that of a leaf blower . the sound power be use to predict propagation of the sound , where the source be assume to be at the hub .

appendix a fundamental of sound

sound level
the decibel be the logarithm of the ratio between two value of a quantity such as power , pressure or intensity , with a multiply constant to give convenient numerical factor . logarithm be useful for compress a wide range of quantity into a small range . for example : log1010 = @card@ log10100 = @card@ log101000 = @card@ the ratio of @card@ : @card@ be compress into a ratio of @card@ : @ord@ this approach be advantageous for handle sound level , where the ratio of the high to the low sound which we be likely to encounter be as high as @card@ , @card@ , @card@ to @ord@ a useful development , many year ago , be to take the ratio with respect to the quiet sound which we can hear . this be the threshold of hearing at @card@ , @card@ hz , which be @card@ micropascals ( μpa ) ( 2x10-5pa ) of pressure for the average young healthy person . sound power in decibel be take with respect to a reference level of @card@ watt . when the word " level " be add to the word for a physical quantity , decibel level be imply , denote by lx , where x be the symbol for the quantity . pressure level

⎡p⎤ l p = @card@ log10 ⎢ ⎥ db ⎣ p0 ⎦

where p be the measured pressure and p0 be the reference pressure level of 2x10-5 pa a little calculation allow us to express the sound pressure level at a distance from a source of know sound power level as sound pressure level , lp = lw - 20log [ r ] - @card@ db where lp be the sound pressure level lw be the sound power level of the source r be the distance from the source

this be the basic equation for spherical sound propagation . it be use in prediction of wind turbine sound but , in a real calculation , have many addition to it , to take into account the atmospheric , ground and topographic condition . however , as a simple calculation , the sound level at a distance of 500m from a source of sound power @card@ dba be @card@ dba . equivalent level ( leq ) : this be a steady level over a period of time , which have the same energy as that of the fluctuate level actually occur during that time . a-weighted equivalent level , designate laeq , be use for many legislative purpose , include for assessment of wind turbine sound . percentile ( ln ) l these be a statistical measure of the fluctuation in overall noise level , that be , in the envelope of the noise , which be usually sample a number of time per second , typically ten time . the most used percentile be l90 and l10 . the l90 be the level exceed for @card@ percent of the time and represent a low level in the noise . it be often use to assess

appendix a fundamental of sound

background noise . the l10 be the level exceed for @card@ percent of the time and be a measure of the high level in a noise . modern computing sound level meter give a range of percentile . note that the percentile be a statistical measure over a specified time interval .

frequency analysis
this give more detail of the frequency component of a noise . frequency analysis normally use one of three approach : octave band , one-third octave band or narrow band . narrow band analysis be most useful for complex tonal noise . it could be use , for example , to determine a fan tone frequency , to find the frequency of vibration transmission from machinery or to detect system resonance . all analysis require an averaging over time , so that the detail of fluctuation in the noise be normally lose . criterion for assessment of noise be base on dba , octave band , or @card@ / 3-octave band measurement . these measure clearly give increasingly detailed information about the noise .

the human ear

appendix b

appendix b

the human ear
human have ear with three general region : @ord@ an outer ear , include an ear ( auditory ) canal @ord@ an air-containing middle ear that include an eardrum and small bone call ossicle ( three in mammal , one in other animal ) @ord@ an inner ear that include organ of hearing ( in mammal , this be the organ of corti in the cochlea ) and balance ( vestibular labyrinth ) airborne sound pass thorough the ear canal , make the eardrum and ossicle vibrate , and this vibration then set the fluid of the cochlea into motion . specialized " hair cell " convert this fluid movement into nerve impulse that travel to the brain along the auditory nerve . the hair cell , nerve cell , and other cell in the cochlea can be damage by excessive noise , trauma , toxin , ear disease , and as part of the age process . damage to the cochlea cause " sensorineural hearing loss , " the most common type of hearing loss in the unite state . it be essential to understand the role of the middle ear , as well as the difference between air conduction and bone conduction . the middle ear perform the essential task of convert airborne sound into inner ear fluid movement , a process know as impedance match ( air be a low-impedance medium , mean that its molecule move easily in response to sound pressure , while water be a high-impedance medium ) . without impedance matching , over @card@ percent of airborne sound energy be reflect away from the body . the middle ear enable animal live in air to hear very soft sound that would otherwise be inaudible , but it be unnecessary for animal that live in water , because sound travel in water pass easily into the body ( which be mostly water ) . when a child have an ear infection , or an adult place earplug in his ear , a " conductive hearing loss " dramatically reduce the transmission of airborne sound into the inner ear . people with conductive hearing loss can still hear sound present directly to the skull by " bone conduction . " this be how both human and fish hear underwater or when a vibrate tuning fork be apply to the head , but it require much more acoustic energy than air conduction hearing .

measure sound

appendix c

appendix c

measure sound
a sound level meter be the standard way of measure sound . environmental sound be normally assess by the a-weighting . although hand-held instrument appear to be easy to use , lack of understanding of their operation and limitation , and the meaning of the varied measurement which they can give , may result in mislead reading . the weighting network and electrical filter be an important part of the sound level meter , as they give an indication of the frequency component of the sound . the filter be as follow : • • • • • • a-weighting : c-weighting : linear ( z-weighting ) : octave filter : third octave filter : narrow band : on all meter on most meter on many meter on some meter on some meter on a few meter

sound level meter weighting network be show in figure c-1 . originally , the a-weighting be intend for low level of noise . c-weighting be intend for high level of noise . the weighting network be base on human hearing contour at low and high level and it be hope that their use would mimic the response of the ear . this concept , which do not work out in practice , have now be abandon and a- and c-weighting be use at all level . linear weighting be use to detect low frequency . a specialist g-weighting be use for infrasound below @card@ hz . figure c-1 show that the a-weighting depress the level of the low frequency , as the ear be less sensitive to these . there be general consensus that a-weighting be appropriate for estimation of the hazard of nihl . with respect to other effect , such as annoyance , aweighting be acceptable if there be largely middle and high frequency noise present , but if the noise be unusually high at low frequency , or contain prominent low frequency tone , the a-weighting may not give a valid measure . compare with other noise source , wind turbine spectra , as hear indoors at typical separation distance , have less low frequency content than most other source ( Pedersen , @card@ ) .

appendix d

propagation of sound
the propagation of noise from wind turbine be determine by a number of factor , include : • • • • • geometrical spread , give by k = 20log [ r ] - @card@ db , at a distance r molecular absorption . this be conversion of acoustic energy to heat and be frequency dependent turbulent scattering from local variation in wind velocity and air temperature and be moderately frequency dependent ground effect - reflection , topography and absorption be frequency dependent ; their effect increase as the frequency increase near surface effect - temperature and wind gradient .

the sound pressure at a point , distant from source , be give by lp = lw - k - d - aa - ag in which : lp be the sound pressure at the receive point lw be the sound power of the turbine in decibel re @card@ watt k be the geometrical spread term , which be inherent in all source d be a directivity index , which take non-uniform spread into account aa be an atmospheric absorption and other near surface effect term ag be a ground absorption and other surface effect term near surface meteorological effect be complex , as wind and temperature gradient affect propagation through the air .

@card@ introduction

this report present result from the study commission by natural power consultant ltd on behalf of a consortium of wind energy company on @card@ march @card@ , on the generic issue relate to the impact of wind turbine on radar and air traffic management , and mitigation measure to address those impact . the focus of this report be collation of information on the practical experience of air traffic service provider of the effect of wind turbine on radar , and the operational consequence thereof . until now , state safeguard policy , particularly in the ministry of defence , have be drive mainly by engineering analysis which have focus on the theoretical probability of wind turbine appear on radar . however little work have be carry out on the significance , from the perspective of air traffic management , of any visible effect on radar . this report identify location both in the uk and abroad where wind turbine be line of sight to radar , and present evidence on the nature of any effect of radar and their significance for the effectiveness and safety of air traffic control . the project workscope be reproduce at appendix a . a list of consultees be reproduce at appendix b .

@card@ type and function of air traffic radar

air traffic control radar be of two type . primary surveillance radar equipment send out pulse of electromagnetic energy which will reflect off object in their path . the radar ' s receiver antenna detect the return ' echo ' and these be display on the radar screen . the time take for the pulse to travel out to the target and back give an indication of the range of the object from the radar , while the antenna ' s orientation in azimuth ( in the horizontal plane ) indicate the direction of the object from the radar . primary radar have no intrinsic means of differentiate one type of object from another ; its energy will bounce off any object in its path . primary surveillance radar for air traffic control have no means of determine the height of any object . as the radar antenna sweep round continuously through @card@ ° , it be scan a large sector of airspace in the vertical plane , typically from @card@ ° elevation up to @card@ ° . any object which be over the same location laterally but be separate vertically will appear in the same place on the radar screen , which be a 2-d display.1 to determine the height of any aircraft appear on their radar , controller must either ask the pilot to report the height of the aircraft , and / or use information derive from secondary surveillance radar . secondary surveillance radar ( ssr ) be the second type of radar equipment use for air traffic control . like primary radar , ssr rely on an antenna rotate continuously through @card@ ° . however the radar do not transmit raw pulse of energy ; it transmit an interrogation signal . this trigger a response signal from equipment know as a transponder in the aircraft . the response signal contain a four-digit code which be set by the pilot , and in most case also contain the height of the aircraft . the return transponder signal be receive at the ssr antenna , decode , and the four-figure code and height be present on the radar screen next to the aircraft ' S location . this enable controller to positively identify radar return on their screen and ( after verbal confirmation from the pilot ) to confirm their height . in the Uk , all aircraft fly at or above @card@ , @card@ foot , and all aircraft fly on instrument in controlled airspace , must carry a transponder . all airliner and military aircraft carry ssr transponder . some light aircraft do not . aircraft fit with transponder may not have them switch on , in which case they will not be visible to ssr . most air traffic control radar unit be equip with both primary and secondary radar . the ssr antenna be often locate on top of the primary radar antenna , the two rotate together . some air traffic control unit have ssr datum feed to them from a remote site by landline or radio link . in some case - for example over south west england and north west scotland - radar service to en route traffic be provide use ssr only , without primary radar .

modern air defence radar be able to differentiate between target vertically by use antenna which be segment , with each antenna segment scan a separate elevation angle .

-3radar have a number of inherent technical limit to its performance . these be outline in a caa circular : ` ` the performance of even the most modern radar be rarely perfect . for example , return from small , slow-moving aircraft such as hang glider , microlights etc may be suppress by electronic circuit which cancel unwanted radar return from road traffic , weather and terrain . even when display , radar return from small or slow-moving aircraft be occasionally indistinguishable from certain non-aircraft return . in the bad case , it may be impossible for the controller to determine conclusively that a transitory radar return be that of an aircraft . hence , controller may not always be aware of all potential confliction , and may be unable to pass avoid action and / or traffic information when an aircraft to which they be provide a radar service be in the vicinity of a small or slow-moving aircraft . ` ` @card@ function radar perform two principal function in air traffic control . aerodrome surveillance radar be use to provide approach control service to aircraft in the vicinity of an airport . this may include vector aircraft to the final approach for landing , provide radar service to depart aircraft , and provide a service to aircraft in transit through the area . in the Uk , aerodrome surveillance radar be approve to a maximum range of 42.5nm from the airfield . aerodrome surveillance radar typically operate in the 10cm waveband . en route radar , which in the uk be all operate by national air traffic service ( nats ) , be use to control or provide radar service to traffic in transit . this include commercial airliner and other traffic fly in controlled airspace , and military traffic . most en route radar operate in the 23cm waveband - a low frequency than aerodrome surveillance radar - since this give the radar longer range . some nats radar - such as those at glasgow , aberdeen , belfast and sumburgh - perform a dual function of aerodrome surveillance and en route .

@card@ air traffic radar service

an outline of the policy , standard and procedure for provision of air traffic radar service in the uk be necessary in order to understand the basis for express concern about the impact of wind turbine on radar , and the feasibility of any mitigation measure . air traffic control service in the Uk article @card@ of the air navigation order ( ano ) @card@ require that civil air traffic control ( atc ) service in the Uk be provide only under the term of an approval grant by the civil aviation authority ( caa ) . article @card@ of the ano stipulate that such air traffic service may only be provide in accordance with standard and procedure specify in a caa-approved manual of air traffic service . the Uk regulatory regime for civilian air traffic control be goalsetting in nature - air traffic service ( ats ) provider be responsible for make their own decision on the service they provide and how they will meet legal obligation and safety standard . the caa then assess whether the ats provider ' S proposal meet safety objective . if the objective be meet the caa grant approval . continue approval be achieve through auditing and inspection , provide in the case of aerodrome radar through three caa safety regulation group ( srg ) regional office across the uk . generic national atc standard and procedure be set out in the manual of air traffic service part @card@ ( mat part @card@ ) . this document provide both mandatory instruction and discretionary guidance to controller and additionally state ` ` ( n ) othing in this manual prevent controller from use their own discretion and initiative in any particular circumstance . ` ` @card@ the standard and procedure apply to particular air traffic control unit be set out in a separate mat part @card@ for each unit . these also require caa approval . for military air traffic control service in the Uk , the standard and procedure be set out in a document know as jsp 318a . mat part @card@ , section @card@ , chapter @card@ , specify the minimum standard for separation distance between aircraft to be apply by air traffic controller . these can be define as horizontal distance , vertical distance , or time period . controller provide a radar service will apply minimum separation standard either by ensure that aircraft return on the radar display be the specified minimum horizontal distance apart , or by ensure that aircraft be separate vertically by the required minimum distance .

-5for the purpose of this report , the required minimum separation standard can be summarise as those apply in control airspace ( Cas ) and those apply in uncontrolled airspace . control airspace exist around major airport and in ' airway ' along the main air traffic route . in almost all Cas in the uk , aircraft be not permit to enter that airspace unless they have receive an air traffic control clearance . in general , controller be permit to assume that any radar return appear within the lateral confine of their airspace , which do not correspond to the position of an aircraft which have receive a clearance , be not an aircraft.4 they will then not be require to provide separation between the unknown return and any aircraft to which they be provide a service . in most control airspace in the vicinity of airport in the Uk , the minimum separation between aircraft be 3nm horizontally or 1000ft vertically . these minima be low than in uncontrolled airspace because controlled airspace be a ' know traffic environment ' , where the intention of all traffic be know and therefore the movement of aircraft be predictable . radar equipment must also meet specify performance standard in order to support 3nm separation . in uncontrolled airspace , because unknown aircraft may be present , include some which be invisible on radar due to their size , shape and / or construction material , minimum separation distance be normally large . where aircraft be be provide with a radar advisory service in uncontrolled airspace ( see below ) , controller will seek to maintain separation of 5nm horizontally or 3000ft vertically against non-participating traffic ( aircraft which be not be provide with an air traffic service by the same unit ) . these separation standard be minima and can be increase at the request of a pilot , when a controller consider it necessary , or at the direction of the caa . the standard can also be reduce in some circumstance . this require caa approval and the reduce minima must be publish in the mat part @card@ for the unit concern . horizontal minima be measure between the centre of the primary return and , where the return be raw radar datum ( not process ) , they must not touch or overlap . when primary radar datum be supply , the horizontal separation must be measure use those primary datum . however mat part @card@ do permit ssr datum to be use alone as a basis for provide horizontal separation between aircraft , in the follow circumstance : ` ` ( i ) where this use have be approve by the authority . ( ii ) to overcome temporary deficiency within primary radar cover , such as fading or clutter , the secondary return only of one aircraft may be use to provide separation from the primary or

or , in case where the Cas do not extend all the way to ground level , the radar return can be assume to be an aircraft fly below the base of the Cas .

-6secondary return of another aircraft provide the primary and secondary radar display be correctly align . ` ` @card@ ssr-only separation can not , however , be use ` ` if a controller have any doubt about the accuracy of the position of radar return due to equipment malfunction , reflection or any other reason . ' ' the standard lay down by the caa safety regulation group ( srg ) in cap @card@ air traffic service safety requirement specify that for a radar to be approve to provide 3nm separation between aircraft , it must have a @card@ % or great probability of resolve ( i.e. . distinguish between ) two target which be 1nm apart over the whole of the radar ' s required azimuth and range . to provide 5nm separation , it must be able to resolve two target 3nm apart . type of radar service there be three type of radar service available to air traffic - radar control , radar advisory and radar information . a radar control service apply only in control airspace . under a radar control service , controller issue head and altitude instruction to pilot which must be obey by the pilot . these instruction be design to ensure that standard vertical or horizontal separation be maintain between all aircraft . in normal circumstance , unidentified or unknown air traffic can be disregard in this airspace since it be a ' know traffic environment ' where all aircraft in the controlled airspace be in contact with , or know to , the controller . in these circumstance , it can be assume that unidentified radar return be either not aircraft , or be aircraft operate outside ( e.g. . below the base of ) the controlled airspace . a radar advisory service ( ras ) be available to aircraft fly under the instrument flight rule ( ifr ) @card@ in uncontrolled airspace . under a ras , controller pass information on other traffic to pilot receive the service , and also advice on heading and / or altitude to fly to maintain the standard 5nm or 3000ft separation from the other traffic . ` ` however , it be recognise that in the event of the sudden appearance of unknown traffic , and when unknown aircraft make unpredictable change in flight path , it be not always possible to achieve these minima . ` ` @card@ a radar information service ( ris ) be available to traffic fly under ifr or vfr ( visual flight rule ) . under a ris , controller will pass information on the position and altitude of other traffic but will not issue advice on heading or altitude to fly to avoid conflict . the crew of the aircraft retain responsibility for separation from the other traffic .

( ii ) weather clutter , or ( iii ) permanent echo . ( b ) the aircraft be operate in an area of high traffic density . ( c ) the aircraft be operate near to the limit of solid radar cover , or ( d ) the service be be provide use secondary radar only . ` ` @card@ radar service to air traffic outside controlled airspace be review in @card@ with the aim of ensure that the standard of service provide be ` ` broadly identical ... regardless of whether the unit provide the service be civil or military . ` ` @card@ while some difference still exist between civil and military atc practice , the standard and procedure relate to the provision of lar be common to civil and military unit . accord to Hq Raf strike command , Raf unit be no more or less likely to limit the radar service be provide to traffic in the presence of radar clutter than their civil counterpart . follow some confusion about the status of a limited radar service , the caa issue supplementary advice in @card@ which state : ` ` limit a service should not be view as a failure to provide the desire service but a useful and sensible way for a controller to indicate to a pilot that the full service can not be provide . however , the controller be still willing to offer assistance to fulfil the primary objective of the service . ` ` @card@

@card@ discriminate aircraft from other radar return the pulse electromagnetic energy transmit by radar will reflect off a wide variety of object in its path . the size , shape , orientation and material of the object will determine how much of the energy be absorb , how much be reflect and in what direction it be reflect . object which be move will cause a shift in the frequency of the return radio wave - an increase frequency for movement towards the radar , a reduce frequency for movement away from the radar . this be know as ' doppler shift ' . move target indicator ( mti ) processing remove from the radar screen any return pulse which either have the same frequency as the transmitted pulse ( indicate no movement ) or be within a specified range of doppler shift , correspond to a range of speed . these threshold may be set to eliminate a variety of unwanted move target , such as rain and other precipitation , tree , the surface of the sea , and road traffic . mti processing be base on detect and measure the radial velocity of a target , i.e. . the component of its velocity direct towards or away from the radar . a target which be travel tangentially to the radar will have zero radial velocity and will therefore be detect as a stationary target and remove by the mti processor . aircraft fly track diagonal to the radar may only have radial velocity of a few ten of knot , which may be within the threshold speed set to eliminate road traffic , lead again to the elimination of a genuine target . further detail of technique for mitigating radar clutter be outline in section @card@ below . precipitation return from weather regularly cause clutter on radar . area of rain and other form of precipitation may be visible , particularly to radar operate at high frequency since their wave will reflect more readily off object as small as a raindrop . weather clutter will typically cover an area of several mile corresponding to the area where rain be fall , and may be severe enough to prevent detection of aircraft within the area of clutter . aircraft - and wind turbine - usually appear as more clearly-defined point target . air traffic radar controller regularly vector traffic around weather clutter in order to maintain the visibility of the aircraft under their control and to ensure separation from any traffic which may be hide by the clutter . old radar be generally more susceptible to weather clutter . the acr430 , for example , which be in use at a number of Uk civil airfield , operate in the 3cm waveband , a high frequency than most current aerodrome surveillance radar , and be highly vulnerable to weather clutter . in radar of this type , reduce the equipment ' s susceptibility to display area of precipitation by turn down the gain would often result in aircraft return be lose in addition to the weather clutter . in these circumstance , controller would limit the radar service provide , as outline above . more

-9modern radar such as the watchman have improve ability to reduce the effect of weather , but measure take to remove weather return from the screen will generally also reduce the radar ' s ability to detect and track aircraft target within the area of precipitation . radar detection of precipitation be increasingly use for weather reporting and forecasting . in the usa , a network of dedicated radar be use for this purpose . in addition , most modern air traffic control primary surveillance radar develop to us federal aviation administration ( faa ) specification have sophisticated digital signal processing which allow them to detect weather through one or more channel while simultaneously but separately display aircraft , with no weather clutter , through other channel . in the Uk , the meet office have a network of dedicated plessey 45c rainfall detection radar . these operate at frequency approximately twice as high as typical air surveillance radar . meet office radar be generally locate on hill top and be orient so that the low part of the antenna beam be at @card@ ° elevation , thus any obstruction at a low height than the antenna will not be illuminate . bird bird can have a radar cross-section of around @card@ square metre , or approximately one hundredth of the radar cross-section of a small light aircraft . however bird be detectable on radar , particularly when they be travel in flock . their radar cross-section be large in s-band , the frequency range use most commonly by aerodrome surveillance radar . flap wing can create a doppler shift in the return signal and can even be analyse in order to determine which specie of bird be be detect . permanent echo feature such as prominent building , hilltop , mast and tower may be constantly visible on the radar screen and identifiable as a particular feature because of their known and static location . these ' permanent echo ' ( pe ) will normally be filter out by mti processing . however pe also provide controller and engineer with a means of calibrate and monitor the performance of the radar . cap @card@ require radar controller or engineer to identify at least three pe , separate by at least @card@ ° in azimuth , to check range and bearing error on analogue primary radars.11

- @card@ @ord@ wind turbine return on radar rotate wind turbine blade can impart a doppler shift to any radar energy reflect off the blade . the radar ' s mti processor may - depend on the threshold set in the processor - detect this as a non-static target and therefore display it as a return on the radar screen . variation in the wind direction at the turbine , the precise position of the blade in its rotation as the radar beam illuminate it , the pitch of the blade and other factor may cause the amplitude and size of the return to fluctuate from one antenna rotation to another . at site with single turbine , any radar return from the rotate turbine blade will stay in one location on the screen . however at site with more than one turbine , the radar may illuminate a blade or blade from one turbine on one antenna sweep , then illuminate the blade of a different turbine on the next sweep . this can create the appearance on the radar screen of return move about within the area of the wind farm over time , sometimes describe as a ` ` twinkle ' ' appearance . the extent to which this will happen will depend on , amongst other factor , the radar ' S range and azimuth resolution - the minimum distance between object which the radar can detect . during consultation for this study , several controller refer to wind turbine return as be ` ` treat as ' ' or ` ` like ' ' permanent echo . in these case , the return be either static , or shift on the radar screen by a small enough distance to be consider as remain in one location . as note above , regulatory requirement dictate that primary radar display must have at least three pe visible on screen in order to provide a means for controller and engineer to monitor the range and bearing accuracy of the radar . the ability of wind turbine to perform this role will depend on the extent to which the turbine return be static and consistently visible . this in turn will be dependent on several factor include the number of turbine , their azimuth extent , their range from the radar , and the effect of wind direction and speed on turbine visibility . airspace wind turbine return on radar have a much more significant effect when the turbine be locate within uncontrolled airspace than when they be situate within or underneath controlled airspace . this be because unknown return appear in or underneath control airspace can be assume not to be aircraft , since if they be aircraft their pilot would have contact the air traffic control agency for that airspace to request a permission to enter . most air traffic inside controlled airspace be fly accord to the instrument flight rule ( ifr ) . aircraft fly under ifr in controlled airspace be provide with standard separation from other ifr traffic by air traffic controller . in the majority of case this separation be provide by mean of radar . in uncontrolled airspace , aircraft may fly without contact any air traffic control agency . there be two principal type of traffic in uncontrolled airspace in the uk : military aircraft , many of them operate at low altitude , and civil light aircraft . these two category of traffic be predominantly fly accord to the visual flight rule ( vfr ) , under which pilot be responsible

- @card@ for maintain their own separation from other aircraft by see and avoid them . airliner and other commercial aircraft also transit uncontrolled airspace in some area . although fly ifr , the pilot of these aircraft be responsible for see and avoid other traffic since they be in uncontrolled airspace . however , since they may be fly in cloud or poor visibility , their ability to see and avoid may be poor or non-existent . consequently commercial traffic fly in uncontrolled airspace will in almost every case make use of a radar service to provide advice and / or information on other traffic in the area . over much of the country , this radar service be provide by radar-equipped civil and military airfield under formal contract . this be know as the low airspace radar service ( lar ) . radar service to aircraft in uncontrolled airspace be also available from other air traffic control unit , controller workload permit . proximity to traffic pattern and instrument procedure the operational significance of any unwanted return on radar will depend not only on the type of airspace within which , or underneath which , they be locate , but also on their proximity to inbound and outbound traffic route , hold pattern , and instrument approach procedure . thus , wind turbine locate on the extended centreline of a runway at a radar-equipped airfield be likely to be regard as a significant problem for controller . turbine locate under standard instrument departure ( sid ) and standard arrival ( star ) route may also be consider problematic , although the effect may be limit by the fact that sids and star be contain within controlled airspace . secondary surveillance radar ( ssr ) the discussion so far in this section have relate exclusively to primary radar . some concern have also be express by the ministry of defence , the Irish aviation authority and other body about the impact of wind turbine on ssr . however , experience from other country ( see below ) indicate that wind turbine effect on ssr be limit to the physical blank and diffract effect of the turbine tower , and that these effect be only a consideration when the turbine be locate very close to the ssr . rotate turbine blade be not consider to have a significant impact on ssr performance due to their low cross-section relative to the size of the beam , and the fact that the return ssr signal have much high power than a return primary radar pulse since it be re-transmitted from the aircraft rather than simply reflect . in the uk , nats treat wind turbine proposal within line of sight of ssrs in the same way as it would treat any static physical obstruction . the caa safeguard criterion for ssrs require rejection of , or consultation on , any propose development infringe a @card@ : @card@ slope from the antenna , out to a range of 4.6km.12 ssr be therefore unlikely to feature as a significant barrier to wind power development in the uk . unlike country such as denmark and the netherlands , en route traffic over most of the uk be control use both primary and secondary radar , usually

- @card@ co-located . this be consider necessary because the uk ' s more mountainous terrain restrict radar coverage , require more radar station to provide reliable coverage , and because air traffic density be high in many part of the uk . the 3nm separation standard apply in most control zone and terminal control area in the uk be only regard as be feasible if primary radar be available for verification and as a back-up should ssr fail . the Uk also have large area of uncontrolled airspace where some traffic may not be transponder-equipped . primary and secondary coverage be essential for provision of radar service in those area . in part of the uk with low traffic level , radar service may be provide use ssr only . this apply to predominantly transatlantic traffic at high altitude off north west scotland and over south west england , use ssrs at stornoway and burrington respectively . the predictable nature of this traffic allow a service to be provide without primary radar . minimum horizontal separation standard when ssr be use without primary radar be increase to 5nm or 10nm . this be to ensure that separation can be maintain by other mean ( such as vertically , or by time separation between follow flight ) should the ssr fail .

- @card@ @ord@ operational experience in the uk there be numerous case of wind turbine in the uk which be locate within line-of-sight of radar . @card@ civil airfield leeds-bradford the @card@ wind turbine on the ovenden moor site in west yorkshire lie 20km south west of leeds-bradford airport . ovenden moor be one of the old establish wind farm in the Uk , have be commission in June @ord@ the turbine be visible at all time to the airport ' S watchman primary surveillance radar as a group of return . no special processing be apply in the radar to reduce or eliminate the wind turbine return . a large proportion of leeds-bradford ' s inbound commercial traffic fly a route from the pole hill vor beacon towards the airport . this route take aircraft directly over the wind farm . ifr traffic be keep inside controlled airspace as it cross this area . the base of controlled airspace above ovenden moor be at 3000ft amsl . local light aircraft and military fast jet regularly fly in the uncontrolled airspace below 3000ft in this area . some of this traffic will appear as primary-only contact on radar , as do the ovenden moor wind turbine . the radar return from inbound ifr traffic regularly pass through the clutter create by the ovenden moor turbine return . however the aircraft return always remain distinguishable from the clutter . controller at leedsbradford do not limit the service provide to traffic overfly the area of clutter cause by the wind farm . in addition to aircraft fly over the wind farm within controlled airspace , leeds-bradford provide radar service to traffic in uncontrolled airspace up to 42.5nm from the airport . high ground to the west of the airport mean that these service be subject to minimum altitude restriction to the west . controller at leeds-bradford do not attempt to provide standard 5nm horizontal separation from the clutter create by the ovenden moor wind turbine when provide a radar service to traffic in the vicinity of the turbine . four wind turbine be commission at chelker reservoir , 20km nw of leeds-bradford airport , in December @ord@ they may also be partly visible to the airport ' S radar . these turbine be within 3nm of the instrument approach procedure for runway @card@ at leeds-bradford , and be in an area where ifr traffic may be descend below control airspace and may therefore be in airspace also contain unknown traffic . radar clutter cause by wind turbine in this area might be regard as require measure to separate traffic from the unknown return . the extent of the visibility of these turbine from the leeds-bradford radar , and whether they be treat in the same way as the ovenden moor turbine , be not know .

- @card@ aircraft in the vicinity of both the chelker reservoir and ovenden moor turbine include low level military traffic transit north-south in a narrow corridor over the pennines . these aircraft be not in radio contact with leedsbradford and generally do not appear on their radar unless they have their transponder switch on . accord to Caa srg inspector responsible for regulation of air traffic service provision at leeds-bradford , no concern have be raise about the effect of the wind turbine on leeds-bradford ' S radar , either through personal contact or through formal reporting mechanism such as the mandatory occurrence report ( mor ) scheme . Prestwick airport prestwick airport ' s marconi en4000 primary surveillance radar be line of sight to two operational wind farm - hare hill , 17.5nm to the south east , and windy standard , 19nm away , also to the south east . neither wind farm be visible on the prestwick radar until a major upgrade of the equipment be complete in autumn @ord@ since then , both wind farm have be visible to vary degree . hare hill lie on the extended centreline of Prestwick ' s main runway , @ord@ all @card@ turbine be visible to the radar , create an area of primary return extend up to 1.5nm across and 1.5nm deep . within this area , individual return appear intermittently , give the appearance of a ' twinkling ' effect . this could give the appearance of a primary-only target move across the area between one sweep of the radar and the next . six of the turbine on the windy standard site be wholly or partially visible to the prestwick radar . however the return from the turbine always appear as a stationary object , with no obvious sign of movement . the reason for the appearance of the windy standard turbine as a stationary return while hare hill present a shift radar image be not know and may be the subject of further investigation . however it be believe that the temporal threshold filter process of the radar may be responsible for the fluctuate visibility of hare hill . this process be perform after the basic mti function have delete all static target . the purpose of temporal threshold processing be to deal with static or slow-moving target which mti have fail to eliminate from the screen . these be target which have some motion , but which remain in the same location - such as a hover helicopter , or sway tree in a high wind . rotate wind turbine may continue to appear since the move blade will impart a phase shift to the return radar pulse in the same way as a genuine move target . temporal threshold processing analyse the clutter level in each temporal cell ( which consist of a number of individual rangeazimuth cell ) over successive antenna sweep . if target which have some doppler content , but which do not move outside the boundary of the cell , appear in a temporal cell the radar processor will raise the clutter threshold by a specified amount , in order to attempt to eliminate the unwanted target .

the Prestwick radar take a full @card@ sweep of the antenna to complete adjustment of the clutter threshold level . if the strength of the wind turbine return be sufficiently large , the processor will progressively raise the threshold until the clutter be delete . in the case of wind turbine return , it be believe that shift in wind direction or lack of coincidence between blade orientation and radar sweep result in an absence of hit from the turbine blade , cause the temporal threshold filter to reset to zero . it will then recommence adjustment of the threshold as turbine return appear again . Prestwick airport have no control airspace in its vicinity below @card@ foot . the area to the south and south-east of the airport be in regular use as a military low fly training area . this be also the sector from which most of Prestwick ' s inbound commercial traffic arrive . these arrive aircraft be require to descend into uncontrolled airspace for some 20nm before reach the prestwick aerodrome traffic zone . this place these aircraft in an air traffic environment where unknown traffic may appear with short notice , the bad case scenario - in term of the potential consequence - be a military jet pull out of the low fly system , for example due to deteriorate weather , and initiate a rapid climb to safety altitude . these conflicting aircraft may be invisible to the prestwick radar due to intervene terrain when they commence their pull-out . the Prestwick airport authority have express concern that clutter from a wind farm could hide unknown traffic of this type for a crucial period , prevent controller from issue timely warning to traffic to whom they be provide a service . air traffic controller at prestwick airport have obtain caa approval for two procedure to mitigate this risk around the hare hill wind farm . the procedure prefer by prestwick be to vector all traffic around the clutter by 5nm in order to maintain standard separation from any aircraft which might appear from within the area of clutter . the other procedure be to route aircraft over , or close than 5nm to , the wind farm area , but to formally limit the radar service provide . this will usually consist of advice to the pilot that there may be late warning , or no warning , of conflicting traffic from below due to an area of radar clutter . the official caa circular on this topic advise that ` ` the pilot be expect to take the warning into account in his general airmanship . ` ` @card@ this would normally include increase visual lookout for any conflicting traffic if the aircraft be not fly in cloud . as outline above , limitation of a radar service be regularly employ by radar unit for a variety of reason and be accept as an inevitable consequence of the technical limitation of radar . in Prestwick ' S case , while the problem be highlight by the location of hare hill directly under the main approach path to the airport , there be a number of circumstance which will mitigate the risk in practice : • the probability of a military jet make its first appearance on radar when directly over the wind farm be extremely small give the number of low

- @card@ level flight in this area and the frequency with which low level pull-out occur ; because of the speed of jet aircraft , traffic be unlikely to be illuminate by the radar for more than one sweep of the antenna while over the wind farm ; for a problem to exist as a result of an aircraft appear on radar for the first time as it cross the wind farm , the controller would have to be look at that part of the screen at the time the aircraft be cross the wind farm ; @card@ military aircraft be require ` ` whenever possible ' ' to have their ssr transponder switch on when operate in the low fly system.15 because of the high power of the return signal , ssr return be usually visible at long range and low altitude than primary return . this will mean that controller may be alert to the presence of unknown traffic before the primary return appear ; if an unknown aircraft fly across the wind farm area be display an ssr return , it will be more visible on the screen and less likely to be lose in the clutter .

the viability of mitigation procedure such as those adopt by Prestwick depend on site-specific circumstance . while procedural measure may be possible for one wind farm , airspace constraint may preclude adoption of similar measure in relation to any additional wind farm . viability will also depend on the location of the wind farm relative to runway orientation , approach and departure path , instrument approach procedure , navigation aid and holding pattern . aberdeen airport a single wind turbine have be in operation at bogfechel farm , whiterashes , under the final approach track to the main runway at aberdeen airport , since the mid-1980 . the turbine be believe to be partially visible to the nats plessey watchman radar on perwinnes hill , 7.2km se of the wind turbine . perwinnes hill supply primary and secondary datum to controller at aberdeen airport and to the Scottish area control centre at Prestwick . primary datum from perwinnes hill receive at aberdeen airport have already be process , with both mti and plot extraction apply to remove ground clutter and successive plot not meet specify criterion for the formation of track . no return from the area of the turbine have be note by controller at aberdeen . however , the visibility of the turbine from the radar head have not be definitively establish , and since the turbine be not in continuous operation it may be less apparent to controller .

Raf marham Raf marham ' s watchman radar have a clear view of the full rotor disc of the single e66 turbine on the north side of swaffham , norfolk . however the turbine only show intermittently on the radar , and the return from the turbine do not present any difficulty to air traffic controller at marham . no special processing have be apply to the marham watchman radar to reduce the turbine ' S signature . Raf marham have intend to object to the construction of the swaffham turbine when it be propose , but their objection be submit too late to be consider in the planning process . however the basis for the objection be not the possible effect on radar , but the fact that an unlit 300ft+ structure in this area could be an obstruction hazard to low fly aircraft . rnas culdrose a 14-turbine wind farm be establish 3.5nm from rnas culdrose ' s watchman radar in @ord@ the following year , the Raf signal engineering establishment carry out a trial to assess the impact of the wind farm on the radar . the report of the trial conclude that the wind farm have a negative impact on the radar ' S performance , notably in degrade the ability to track aircraft target over the wind farm area . the report ' S conclusion have since form much of the basis for the ministry of defence ' s policy in relation to wind farm visible to radars.16 two feature of the culdrose study be notable : • the goonhilly turbine be only @card@ to 3.8nm from the rnas culdrose radar , a much short distance than most other wind turbine-radar situation , at least in the uk . • the raf see trial do not consider whether the radar return from the wind turbine be operationally significant . consultation with air traffic control personnel at rnas culdrose have determine that the turbine remain visible on the station ' S radar . however , suppression of the return from the wind farm region be apply use rag ( range azimuth gate ) mapping technique . with suppression apply , atcos have experience ` ` some degradation ' ' of radar performance in the region around the wind farm . the extent and nature of the degradation be unknown , but be be monitor by atc staff at culdrose as part of an ongoing Raf see ( now dcsa ( dei ) ) interest in this case . accord to rnas culdrose , any degradation of radar performance that do exist be insignificant operationally since the bulk of the traffic operate in the area around the wind farm be vfr and the location be well away from the airfield ' s instrument procedure . no special measure be apply to route aircraft away from the wind farm , and publish procedure for rnas culdrose make no reference to radar performance degradation due to the wind turbine , though they be list as a vertical obstruction .

trimingham nats operate an en route radar facility at trimingham , near cromer on the norfolk coast , provide a radar service ( anglia radar ) primarily for helicopter operate to and from offshore installation in the southern north sea . the radar be 17nm from the blood hill and somerton wind farm . anglia radar ' S controller be base at aberdeen airport and use datum derive from several radar head include claxby , near market rasen in Lincolnshire , and trimingham . raw return from the primary radar be process to provide correlation with ssr datum and to reduce the size of the return . the blood hill / somerton wind turbine paint intermittently on the trimingham radar in the form of small point . the return occasionally shift laterally , possibly indicate alternate illumination of different turbine . the maximum lateral distance over which the turbine return may be visible be less than one nautical mile . the turbine return be well know and recognise by controller and be not regard as present any difficulty to the controller ' task . most traffic in the immediate area be helicopter follow recognise and regular track , and all traffic to which a service be be provide will be transponding . low level military fast jet traffic be also common in the area but the vast majority of this traffic be also transponding . the turbine return do not constitute a significant enough area of clutter to warrant limit the radar service to transponding traffic . however controller might limit the service to traffic for which only primary radar datum be available ( i.e. . aircraft which do not carry an ssr transponder or do not have it switch on ) . Lowther hill the nats en route radar on Lowther hill be line of sight to two wind farm windy standard ( @card@ nm ) and hagshaw hill ( @card@ nm ) . nats engineering and operational support personnel at the Scottish area control centre ( scacc ) advise that no concern have be raise about return from these wind farm . recent upgrade of the mti software on the Lowther hill radar have improve its ability to filter out road traffic which may also assist in suppress any wind turbine return . however no specific processing have

Uk Caa srg official have point out that policy on air traffic management in denmark be different from those in the uk and that this may account for denmark ' s great willingness to accept wind turbine . the key difference be , first , that denmark do not use primary radar for en route air traffic control , rely solely on ssr for this task . ssr be less vulnerable to wind turbine effect . second , srg would not permit plot extraction over area of clutter in the way that kastrup do . further evidence on the comparison of Danish and Uk regulatory policy in this area be require , notably on the experience of airport other than kastrup , the acceptability in practice of plot extraction in en route radar and in control airspace in the uk , and Danish radar coverage of traffic outside controlled airspace . @card@ usa stockton , california raytheon canada have install an all solid state s-band asr-10 radar for the federal aviation administration ( faa ) at a site near stockton , east of san francisco . the radar be within line of sight of a number of wind turbine . accord to raytheon system and the faa , although the radar employ digital processing , it have only three doppler filter and have not be entirely successful in filter out wind turbine return . raytheon engineer also find that the wind turbine have a slight skew effect on the radar ' s antenna beam , cause some azimuth error . palm spring , california a new northrop-grumman asr-9 primary surveillance radar become operational at palm spring in january @ord@ this replace an asr-8 which have suffer considerable problem due to clutter from the many wind turbine in the palm spring area . wind turbine clutter have lead to limitation of radar service to aircraft in the area around the wind turbine . the asr-9 be the first radar to use mtd technology , provide a vast increase in performance over mti radar . the asr-9 at palm spring have modification apply which originated from faa engineering research to deal with radar clutter from migratory bird in the san francisco area . the modification in the palm spring radar include dynamic clutter mapping and six doppler filter , provide much enhanced sensitivity to move clutter at different velocity . air traffic controller at palm spring be now able to vector traffic across the wind turbine without any detrimental effect on radar performance since the turbine no longer appear on the radar screen . no limitation of radar service be require .

- @card@ @ord@ mitigation technique @card@ radar process primary radar will detect any target which meet the threshold , or criterion , set in the radar ' S processing . radar performance be determine by the balance between the probability of detect wanted target ( probability of detection , pd ) and the probability of detect unwanted or false target . the ratio between these two probability be know as the false alarm rate . measure to increase the probability of detect wanted target may also increase the probability of false or unwanted detection . a number of measure can be use to improve a radar ' s ability to discriminate between wanted and unwanted target . amplitude threshold if the unwanted target ( such as rain or bird ) be expect to have a low radar cross-section than the desire target , the amplitude of the unwanted return can be expect to be low than that of the genuine target . a voltage threshold can be set in the radar cause return below a give amplitude to be ignore . however , wind turbine can have radar crosssection large than aircraft target so this method have very limit utility . range-azimuth gat ( rag ) this process identify particular range-azimuth cell , or group of cell , within which return be suppress . rag usually involve suppression of all return from the identify cell , create a hole in the radar cover . constant false alarm rate a development of the amplitude threshold method be to apply threshold which will maintain a constant false alarm rate ( cfar ) . this process , also know as temporal threshold processing , be design to maintain radar performance in area where there be clutter . a threshold be set for a group of range-azimuth cell . if the large return from that area in one antenna sweep be of great amplitude than the large return from the previous antenna sweep , the threshold be increase to try to eliminate the clutter . after several antenna revolution the threshold will rise sufficiently to eliminate the clutter . this process be quite effective in remove shifting clutter return from the radar screen . however , if a desire target within the area have a weak return than the clutter , or if it stay within the area for several antenna sweep ( as for example a hover or slow-moving helicopter might ) , the clutter threshold will eliminate that genuine target as well as the clutter . doppler discrimination radar can discriminate between wanted move target and unwanted static or slow-moving target by process out those that do not exceed a give radial velocity . this be do by detect difference in the phase - doppler shift - of consecutive return pulse receive by the radar . leave aside aircraft fly tangentially to the radar , which will have a low radial velocity , most clutter will have low doppler value than aircraft return . however ,

- @card@ wind turbine be problematic since blade tip speed may be as much as @card@ knot , similar to the speed of a light aircraft or helicopter . there be two established method of doppler processing in radar to suppress slow-moving or static clutter while maintain detection of aircraft . move target indication ( mti ) mti process several consecutive return pulse . the output of this process identify any object with zero doppler , i.e. . which be static , and can then eliminate that object from the radar display . basic mti can only eliminate static object . adaptive mti ( amti ) not only filter out the fix clutter , but also estimate the predominant doppler value of the remain , move clutter in each range-azimuth cell , and filter it out . amti can therefore cancel out move as well as fix clutter . move target detection ( mtd ) mtd be also base on analyse the characteristic of a series of consecutive return pulse . mtd have the ability to generate a number of filter corresponding to different velocity range , thus give the radar great ability to discriminate between return with different velocity . however both mti and mtd be dependent on there be some measurable difference in the doppler value of genuine target and those of any clutter or unwanted target . great discrimination between different doppler value require a high pulse repetition frequency ( prf ) . because correct measurement of range depend on a return pulse be receive before the next pulse be transmit , the high the prf , the low will be the maximum unambiguous range of the radar . thus mtd be usually less suitable for en route radar , which have a low prf in order to achieve long range . mtd also require great processing power . this be a limit factor for many old technology radar , and restrict the most sophisticated doppler filter technique to the late solid-state radar . clutter map point clutter such as building , tower , chimney and radio mast , and much ground clutter , be predictable and unchanging . rather than require the radar to analyse and detect this clutter and process it on every antenna sweep , use up processor power , the clutter characteristic can be store in a memory circuit , which be then access on each sweep to remove that clutter from the signal . this be know as a clutter map . some radar have numerical limit on the number of range-azimuth cell which can be use for clutter mapping or rag technique . the total number of cell available may not be sufficient to accommodate processing of all clutter source visible to the radar , especially where extensive wind farm be involve . automatic tracking further processing can include automatic detection of aircraft track . this be base on analysis of successive return from a target to determine the

- @card@ direction and speed of its movement . automatic tracking radar will display only target meet the specified track criterion so , for example , return which do not match the speed characteristic of an aircraft will not be display . this process be also know as plot extraction . the screen display have no ' raw ' radar return but show confirm track as a line indicate the direction of the movement , the length of the line indicate the speed of the aircraft . plot extraction can be further develop so that the track of an aircraft can be project through an area of poor coverage by ' coast ' . this involve the track processor predicting where the next plot from the aircraft will be , give its track history in term of speed and direction . coast can therefore allow track to continue over area where the radar may not actually be illuminate the aircraft . tracking processor can also suppress track initiation in selected area . this will reject any track which first appear in a selected area ( such as a range-azimuth cell contain a wind turbine ) but will retain pre-exist track which have enter that cell from elsewhere . acceptability of this type of processing will depend on the probability of an aircraft first appear on radar in that cell and the probability that it will generate a track on move into adjacent cell . probability will be dependent on the physical dimension of the range-azimuth cell . the small the cell , the small the impact on radar coverage area , and also the less time aircraft will spend in each suppress cell . as a guide , a typical faaspecification airport surveillance radar have range-azimuth cell measure @card@ ° in azimuth ( 242m wide at 10nm range from the radar ) by @card@ / 16nm ( 115m ) in range . acceptability of track initiation suppression will also depend on the traffic mix . if slow moving , non-transponding traffic such as helicopter or light aircraft be likely to fly in the area , regulator may regard track initiation suppression as unacceptable . antenna elevation evidence from belfast suggest that wind turbine clutter may be avoid by raise the antenna beam elevation angle . air traffic service provider may be less willing to contemplate such a measure for a man-made development than they would for unavoidable cause of clutter , such as terrain , but experience with propose measure to mitigate the effect of the windy standard wind farm on the Lowther hill radar suggest that this may be a feasible technique . it be likely to be more applicable in the case of en route radar than for aerodrome surveillance radar since coverage at low level be more important for the latter . mitigation policy and practice there appear to be inconsistency in the application of radar safeguard policy with respect to wind turbine in the uk . Caa srg official have state that the processing out of wind turbine return on radar , whether by eliminate all return from particular region ( through such technique as range-azimuth gat ) or by use of multiple doppler filter to screen out

- @card@ target meet specified velocity criterion , be unacceptable since there can be no guarantee that these process will not also eliminate genuine target such as slow-moving helicopter or light aircraft . however , in practice , a variety of radar processing technique be already apply in radar in the uk to eliminate weather clutter and road traffic in particular . these technique be likely to involve some degradation of the radar ' s capability to detect target move at similar velocity - again , typically , slow-moving helicopter and light aircraft . in some control air traffic environment , this degradation of primary radar performance will be of little or no concern because helicopter will be use transponder and nontransponder-equipped light aircraft be not permit in the airspace . however in uncontrolled airspace , or category of controlled airspace where non-transponding vfr traffic be permit , these processing technique will already be reduce radar performance against some traffic . processing technique such as plot extraction be also widely use in nats radar . at aberdeen airport , for example , approach radar service be provide use datum from the nearby dual-function ( en route / aerodrome ) perwinnes hill radar head . plot extraction be perform at the radar site and the processed datum feed to aberdeen airport by modem . this processing eliminate any target which do not move by a define amount within a specified time period . this would include , for example , a hover or slowmoving helicopter . the acceptability of this type of processing at aberdeen be notable give the high volume of helicopter traffic there . further , nats have give approval for suppression of wind turbine return in at least one case involve a large wind farm proposal in an important area for commercial air traffic near a civil airport . some mismatch between response to wind farm development proposal and exist operational experience be also evident in the ministry of defence . the operational significance of particular wind turbine impact on radar at Raf airfield in the uk be assess by staff at Hq Raf strike command operational support ( atc ) . each case be consider on its merit , take account of proximity to runway , flight path and instrument pattern . cumulative impact of several wind farm within line of sight of a radar be a grow concern . however , although the Raf safeguard policy document , ap100g-03 , set out limit for the total angular extent of any obstruction for secondary surveillance radar , @card@ no such criterion be apply in the case of primary radar . assessment of operational significance be base on professional judgement take into account the specific circumstance of each case . experience at Raf st mawgan and other military airfield indicate that professional judgement of air traffic control safety specialist may permit multiple wind turbine in several sector .

- @card@ technical feasibility a large proportion of the atc radar infrastructure at Uk civil airport comprise Marconi @card@ and plessey watchman primary radar . both equipment be now support by alenia marconi system , and impending reorganisation be likely to mean that the formerly physically separate engineering support team for the two radar will be merge in one location . this should simplify the investigation of both hardware and software solution which might be apply as an upgrade to existing radar . @card@ procedural mitigation while it be clear that many air traffic controller be happy to continue provide a radar service over and in the vicinity of clutter from wind turbine without limit the service , procedural measure can be apply . the two principal procedure be those currently in use at prestwick airport - vector traffic around the clutter , with the aim of maintain 5nm separation from the clutter , or limit the radar service if traffic be vector over or within 5nm of the clutter . these procedure be applicable to wind turbine locate in uncontrolled airspace . for turbine locate in or under controlled airspace , mitigation should not be necessary since unidentified return can be disregard . Prestwick airport have suggest that wind farm clutter within controlled airspace may prevent controller maintain standard 3nm separation between aircraft , lead to controller have to vector traffic around any such clutter , but support for this view have not be find from operational experience elsewhere in the uk .

- @card@ @ord@ approach to consultation and mitigation the impending devolution of safeguard decision-making from the caa to individual airfield will compound the lack of a clear national basis for decision on the likely impact of propose wind turbine on radar . the senior atco at prestwick airport have suggest that airfield should produce their own safeguard map which would indicate the most important area for clear radar performance as a guide to wind turbine developer . while this approach have much merit , it would need to be underpin by agree national standard on how to draw up such map . without this , wind turbine development would be at the mercy of vary policy across the country . in the absence of a sufficiently sophisticated engineering model which can predict the impact of a specific turbine on a specific radar , national policy must be base on current practical experience . the alternative be to base policy on the theoretical possibility of negative effect , as seem to be the case centrally in the mod , though not at operational level in the armed force . a policy of object to any wind turbine development which might create a radar return would result in continued inability to meet renewable energy target since large area of the country would effectively be sterilise for wind energy development . there be scope for bring together controller and engineer with practical experience of the radar-wind turbine issue , and regulator and policy-maker , to explore the way in which air traffic controller currently cope with visible wind turbine , and to identify transferable lesson in those case where wind turbine be not regard as create serious problem .

- @card@ @ord@ conclusion and recommendation

there be clear example in the uk of co-existence of wind turbine and air traffic control radar . these example exist at a range of civil and military airfield and en route radar station . they include several case where the wind turbine have be in operation for several year without any requirement for intervention by the regulatory / approval authority . the wind power industry should draw these example to the attention of the key decision-maker in the air traffic control and airfield regulatory / approval authority and establish a detailed dialogue with those authority to identify the key determinant of acceptable radar / wind farm co-existence and the operational limit of that co-existence . this may be do under the auspice of the existing work group or separately . case study from denmark , the netherlands and the usa indicate that technical solution have be apply which enable radar to process out wind turbine return while retain genuine aircraft track . while these technology be particularly available in the most modern solid-state radar design , there appear to be some scope for retrofitting of advanced processing software to old radar , such as those which make up the bulk of the Uk air traffic control infrastructure . the wind industry should consider support a feasibility study by the one radar manufacturer now responsible for these old radar , to assess the scope for radar upgrade to process out wind turbine return . the caa have indicate that radar track processing of the type employ in dutch and Danish atc radar be not acceptable in the uk . the wind industry should engage the caa in a dialogue about the reason for the uk ' s different policy on this issue , with a view to change it . the backing of radar manufacturer may be useful in support this move . the caa have also state that it do not favour the range-azimuth gat ( rag ) approach to eliminate wind turbine return , which also eliminate aircraft return from those portion of the radar ' S cover . however nats , the main atc radar operator in the uk , appear to take a different view , even in relation to very large wind farm near busy civil airport . the contradiction between these position need to be discuss with the caa and nats and a consistent policy develop in consultation with the wind industry .

" • there be no clinical baseline for the study and no case control group to validate the research , both of which be standard practice in any responsible research of this nature . • the research have not be publish in any peer review academic or medical journal . • the evidence make the very simple mistake of conclude that a " correlation prove causation " . this be wrong . • the attempt to imply the industry will discount the health problem as merely " imaginary or psychosomatic " be not substantiate and ignore decade of scientific evidence on noise and vibration .

@ord@ can wind turbine produce " harmful low frequency noise ' no . academic who specialize in low frequency sound have discount pierpoint ' S claim , not least because they ignore decade of established medical research . although the book use manchester university ' s recent research3 into the working of the human ear to justify its conclusion , the author of that research , Dr neil todd , have state : " our work do not provide the direct evidence suggest ... i do not believe that there be any direct evidence to show that any of the above acoustico-physiological mechanism be activate by the radiation from wind turbine . " research by g leventhall4 in the peer-reviewed journal Canadian acoustics examine whether or not wind turbine produce infrasound at level that can impact human . specifically it refute the allegation about infrasound , which the research conclude be " irrelevant and possibly harmful , should they lead to unnecessary fears5 " . @ord@ be wind farm noisy ? in @card@ , as part of research into wind farm noise commission by the government , the university of Salford survey all local authority in the uk where wind farm be in operation . out of all Uk wind farm ( @card@ at the time of the report operate for up to @card@ year ) , only one wind farm have ever be find guilty of cause a nuisance to the near resident - and the issue have since be resolve through management of the turbine control system . in comparison , the report highlight that in one year alone ( and for only @card@ % of local authority in england and wale , not the entirety of the Uk ) , there be @card@ , @card@ case of noise nuisance not relate to wind farm noise .

optimize the use of natural energy resource and combine the new technology . the optimal stand-alone power system many remote town or sparsely populated area be not service by the main power grid . power have to be generate locally use engine generator power by conventional fuel , such as diesel . however the transport and storage of diesel fuel can be expensive and the supply be not always reliable . therefore , diesel generator be well use on a short-term basis or for emergency purpose . solar and wind energy be good alternative to provide more consistent year-round energy production . solar and wind energy be also the most available renewable energy resource on earth , and many remote area have plenty supply of both . the sun be the source of all energy on earth . wind be a form of solar energy and be cause by the uneven heating of the earth ' s surface by the sun . for example , the pole receive less energy from the sun than the equator do , and the dry land heat up and cool down more quickly than the sea do . in much of the earth , wind speed be low in the summer when the sun shine bright and long . the wind be strong in the winter when less sunlight be available . wind speed be also low during the day when sunlight be strong , but increase after dark when the earth surface be cool . because the peak for wind flow and sunlight occur at different time of the day and year , wind energy and solar energy can complement each other . a hybrid solar-wind power system can balance out the ever fluctuate solar and wind resource , and be more likely to produce power when you need it . the good combination of technology solar power system use solar panel to convert light energy into electrical energy . solar regulator , which be also know as solar charge controller , regulate the solar panel ' S charge current before it be store in bank of specially design battery . power inverter be then use to convert direct current ( dc ) electricity produce by the solar panel cell to alternate current ( ac ) . the advantage of solar system be their reliability and low operate cost . but they be relatively expensive to manufacture . wind power be the conversion of wind energy into electricity use wind turbine , which turn in the move air and power an electric generator that supply an electric current . similar to solar power system , charge controller be use to regulate the charge current and before it be store in battery bank , and inverter then be use to convert dc to ac . the advantage of wind power system be their low production and operate cost , but the disadvantage be their low reliability . solar and wind power system both suffer from variation in the weather , result in inconsistent power supply . battery be need for non-charging period in order to stabilize supply . however , daily electricity output could fluctuate greatly due to variation in weather . the fluctuation could lead battery under-charged for a long period of time , cause the battery life to shorten . since solar power and wind power can complement each other as energy source , a hybrid solar-wind power system will optimize the use of these two natural energy resource for off-grid power supply . manufacturing cost of hybrid system can be reduce because the same battery bank and inverter can be use for both the solar and the wind component . however , one obstacle still remain for wide spread use of hybrid wind-solar power system : the reliability of small wind generator . at ari , we consider the reliability criterion for wind generator as follow : the speed of wind vary from moment to moment so it be not reliable to rate electricity output base on the wind speed of a particular moment . the average wind speed vary little from year to year for a give area . this allow us to calculate annual electricity generation with reasonable accuracy . base on the formula , e = 0.2d2v3 , energy vary with the third power of the wind speed . during the year , wind speed vary between 3m / S and 8m / S . electricity output should be measure base on the low end of the wind speed instead of the peak speed . wind generator often have to work in extreme weather condition such as sand storm , rain storm , turbulent wind climate , and in high salt alkaloid environment . to ensure reliability , the turbine must undergo rigorous test , potentially increase cost . system which be less costly be usually under-tested , and therefore , less reliable . advanced over-speed protection system as the technology of small wind generator have advance in past decade , so have the industry . however , the reliability of small wind generator continue to plague this industry . due to cost consideration , manufacturer tend to use mechanical controller , which be base on simple principle of aerodynamics , for wind power control , in lieu of the more technologically advanced and more expensive hydraulic pressure controller . while it could pass wind tunnel test , mechanical controller , which have movable part , do not work well in the field due to the complexity and rapidity of change in wind speed and wind direction . often in extreme weather condition , the movable mechanical part invariably wear out , result in the break-down of the system . since the few the movable part , the less the chance for a breakdown , high quality wind generator today typically have only three movable part : main body of wind turbine rotor blade over-speed protection system the first two movable part be indispensable because they make up the core of a wind turbine . they also do not wear out as easily as the controller . in order to increase reliability , we must turn our attention to the over-speed protection system . all wind turbine be design with some kind of over-speed protection system . in case of strong wind it be necessary to waste part of the excess energy of the wind in order to avoid damage the wind turbine . there be two different way of design an over-speed protection system on modern wind turbine . pitch control wind turbine that turn blade out of the wind when the wind output become too high , and turn them back into the wind when the wind drop . stall control wind turbine that have rotor blade bolt onto the hub at a fix angle . when the wind speed become too high , it create turbulence on the side of the rotor blade which be not face the wind . this stall prevent the lift force of the rotor blade from act on the rotor . however , both approach have technical problem . wind flow be a complex phenomenon . not only be turbulence a constant occurrence , but also the change of wind speed and direction be instantaneous and frequent . no mechanical apparatus can react swiftly enough to the instant change in wind flow . as a result , the heavy wear and tear often cause the breakdown of the wind turbine . Ari renewable energy co. have develop a brand new electromagnetic brake for Ari hybrid solar-wind generator . the new technology incorporate an entirely new magnetoelectricity regulator that function as a brake . this brand-new regulating protection idea have discard the mechanical regulation structure and have fundamentally solve reliable operational problem associate with the hybrid solar-wind generator . this brand-new regulating control idea have follow advantage : it have discard the mechanical regulating structure and the wind turbine therefore only retain two movement part . as a result , it greatly enhance the structural stability and reliability of the Ari wind turbine . the design of the main body of the wind turbine now have more artistic and diverse choice when the mechanical regulating structure be limit . the advanced over-speed protection system also give different level of charge control accord to the wind speed scope , which greatly increase the reliability of the Ari hybrid solar-wind power system . i . safety precaution ari solar-wind generator be design under strict safety regulation . however , any electrical and / or mechanical equipment , during installation or operation , can cause potential inherent danger without safety precaution . please read thoroughly the follow ari solar-wind power generator safety precaution before installation of your solar-wind generator . @card@ i nstallation S afety rotate blade can move fast enough that the tip of a blade be almost invisible and can cause serious injury when a person come near the move rotor blade . please do not install the turbine where anyone can come in contact with the blade . please do not install the blade until the turbine be mount on the tower . undersized wire or bad connection can cause over-current electrical danger and overheat in wiring system , that could cause fire or inherent personal danger . please follow the instruction on the wire-sizing chart in this manual strictly . please fuse all connection and choose the correct size of fuse or circuit breaker accord to the guideline of this manual . it be very important to disconnect all turbine wiring from battery , turn the controller switch off before installation . please carefully follow the step by step installation procedure . connect the wire to the battery prior to the installation of the turbine can cause the rotor to spin-up during installation and result in personal injury . please do not attach the wire to the battery throughout the installation process . during tower setup , under no circumstance should any human being stand near the construction site . it be important for you to consult with a local specialized tower installation technician . and you will need someone available to help during the installation process . the turbine installation should take place on the ground level prior mount the turbine to the tower . please do not allow any unassociated person or crowd stand near the construction site during the installation process . 1 . @card@ operation safety fasten all tower weld , bolt , nut and tighten all connection before operation . before regular maintenance or battery replacement , please shut down the turbine by set the controller switch to " stop " position . please do not disconnect the battery wire when the controller be set to " on " position . the move rotor blade can be break if a solid object come in contact with them . after set the controller switch to " stop " position , you should wait until the blade stop from rotate before any maintenance or inspection of the blade . ari wind turbine be design to shut down automatically when a strong wind blow through the site . however , before extreme weather approach your area , such as but not limit to hurricane , tornado , and extreme wind ( @card@ mph+ ; @card@ m / S ) , you should lower down the tower to protect any potential accidence . before lower down the tower , you must set the controller switch to " stop " position , disconnect the wire lead to battery , and make sure the blade stop from rotate . 2 . part in the package please unpack and check the pack list to make sure every part be include in the packing box . no . part name quantity @card@ alternator main body @card@ @card@ rotor shaft @card@ @card@ hub @card@ @card@ rotor blade @card@ @card@ m8 * @card@ screw @card@ @card@ m8 flat washer @card@ @card@ m8 anti-loosening nut @card@ @card@ nose cone @card@ @card@ nose cone cover @card@ @card@ m6 * @card@ screw @card@ @card@ ф @card@ flat washer @card@ @card@ m24 nut @card@ @card@ ф @card@ spring pad @card@ @card@ m8 * @card@ screw @card@ @card@ ф flat washer @card@ @card@ ф spring pad @card@ @card@ main body shaft @card@ @card@ yaw shaft @card@ @card@ cable wire @card@ @card@ yaw shaft connector @card@ @card@ . f eatures @card@ . @card@ alternator ari wind alternator be make with high quality , high strength permanent magnetic material . it be lightweight and compact with high power generating capacity . ari wind alternator expert have use the unique electromagnetic design technology that have very small start resistance , thus effectively guarantee the startup of ari wind turbine even with gentle breeze . the alternator be design to provide efficient dc power generation with electronic control system . the power capacity and startup performance have make this alternator one of the good alternator in the world . 3 . @card@ turbine ari turbine main body be make with high quality die cast aluminum alloy from a precision cast process and stainless steel component , and thus be lightweight but extremely strong with a very high reliability . because of the precision casting process , ari wind turbine not only finish in perfect shape , but also the aluminum cast function as a cool system to the turbine , for it transfer heat into wind pass through the turbine .

feasibility of a unique wind feasibility of a unique wind power home heating system by : mark f . Czajkowski Prof. kenneth d . visser the objective of this thesis be to determine if wind turbine be an economically sound method , of provide energy , for space heating and water heating in a home , and if a small scale contra rotate vertical axis wind turbine ( cr-vawt ) be feasible . on average a household in the northeastern portion of the u.s. spend $ @card@ , @card@ annually to heat their home . this calculation be base on a @card@ , @card@ ft2 home that use natural gas . the cost be the summation of the cost of fuel , equipment , and the social cost of pollution . the cost of fuel be $ @card@ per year1 , @card@ . the equipment cost be calculate use a present value annuity for @card@ year and @card@ % . therefore , a $ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ furnace cost the homeowner $ @card@ per year . pollution from furnace present a cost to society in the form of health effect and global warming . accord to pearce ( @card@ ) , $ @card@ be spend on the effect of one ton of carbon dioxide . as a result , the carbon dioxide from the average northeastern home cost society $ @card@ per year7 . for a wind turbine power heat system to be economical , the cost would have to be less than $ @card@ , @card@ annually . to determine if this be feasible the total cost be calculate use present value annuity for @card@ year at @card@ % . the cost of the turbine power heating system will have to be less than $ @card@ , @card@ . the size of the turbine be need in order estimate the cost of the heating system . it be determine that a @card@ kw turbine would be sufficient to supply the heat for an average home . a @card@ kw wind turbine from Bergey windpower co. be list at $ @card@ , @card@ , below the $ @card@ , @card@ to be economical . the bergey excel , @card@ kw turbine and the wisper @card@ , @card@ kw turbine be price below $ @card@ , @card@ and it would be economical for a homeowner to install the turbine to heat their home . furthermore , the turbine come with equipment to connect it to either a battery bank or the electric grid . this equipment be costly and would not be necessary if the turbine be connect to a heating system . the heating system would use an immersion heater , which be an enclose resister . the resister can accept electricity at any frequency , unlike the power grid that need @card@ hz . vertical axis wind turbine ( vawt ) have be around for many year and have many advantageous that a small homeowner could take advantage of . a vawt be a relatively simple design , do not need to track the wind direction , could perform well in turbulent wind , and the generator can be locate near the ground for easy maintenance . a cr-vawt be two vawts on the same tower that spin opposite direction . the cr-vawt be advantageous because the rpm at the generator be high than a comparable vawt . there be no record of a cr-vawt be research or on the market ; therefore , this research be to test the feasibility of the concept . a test turbine be design in solidworks and be show in figure @ord@ the turbine have be build , figure @card@ , and will be test in clarkson university ' s wind tunnel . figure @card@ : cr-vawt solidworks model figure @card@ : cr-vawt prototype a similar type of turbine have be research at clarkson university over the past three year , the contra rotate horizontal axis wind turbine ( cr-hawt ) . the main issue with the turbine be that both rotor spin the same direction even though their blade be position such that they should spin in opposite direction . it be suggest that the force , that spin the generator , be cause the unanticipated result . rotor with different solidity be test to try to balance to torque . the turbine do work , but be inconsistent and difficult to keep both rotor from spin the same direction.8 testing of the cr-vawt will be do to determine if a cr-vawt be feasible , and to gain more knowledge on contra rotate turbine . when design a test turbine , the problem with the horizontal axis wind turbine be take into consideration . therefore , if the torque from one turbine be more powerful then the other , the turbine have design such that the diameter of the outside rotor can be change , and therefore the torque from the outside rotor can be change . it be hypothesize that if the torques from both rotor be the same , the turbine will function correctly . reference : energy information administration , @card@ space-heating energy consumption in u.s. household by four most populated state , @card@ , residential energy consumption survey energy information administration , @card@ water-heating energy consumption in u.s. household by four most populated state , @card@ , residential energy consumption survey energy information administration , march , @card@ , u.s. natural gas residential price ( dollar per thousand cubic foot ) , Besley , S. , Brigham , e.f. , @card@ , principle of finance , third edition , Thomson south western energy information administration , @card@ water-heating energy consumption in u.s. household by four most populated state , @card@ , residential energy consumption survey pearce , d . , Nov. @card@ , the social cost of carbon and its policy implication , oxford review of economic policy . vol.19 , iss . 3 ;

performance of main connect small-scale wind turbine
nick stannard
@ord@ abstract small-scale wind turbine have be recognise by the Uk government as play a significant role in the future Uk energy mix [ @card@ ] . as such , it be important that the necessary turbine and generator system be well match in order to maximise power output and energy capture . in this paper a turbulent wind model be combine with model of the turbine , generator and power conversion system to study potential problem that can arise with incorrect turbine design . a small @card@ kw , " h " bladed vertical axis wind turbine be study to examine the effect different blade profile may have in turbulent wind . a symmetrical blade section be see to cause potential stall problem whilst these be avoid by the use of a camber blade section . @ord@ introduction figure @card@ depict a 2.5kw vertical axis wind turbine ( vawt ) that may soon become a common sight in the build environment . the turbine employ a 3-phase permanent magnet generator that have be develop at durham particularly for use with such turbine , and be show in the photo . ( further detail of the generator can be find in reference [ @card@ ] . ) figure @card@ show how the system be connect electrically : the 3phase ac from the generator be rectify to dc and then invert back to ac at main frequency and voltage .

care must be take to properly integrate the different component of the system in order to produce efficient conversion of wind energy to electricity . for example , the generator must be design to produce not only rate power at the rate turbine speed , but also to provide the correct voltage throughout the speed range . this point be crucial because the inverter export power to the grid in proportion to the generator ' S voltage ( neglect loss ) . if this voltage be too high , the inverter will try to export too much power and this may cause the turbine to stall . likewise , if the voltage be too low , only a tiny amount of electrical energy will be generate . the blade profile be another critical aspect of the system design which affect the maximum energy capture of the turbine , its optimal rotational speed , its self-starting ability , and its susceptibility to stall in turbulent wind . it be this last aspect which be of particular interest in this paper and be explore in some depth . it be find that if the designer fail to match the load characteristic - impose by the inverter - with the turbine characteristic , a sudden gust of wind may force the turbine into the stall zone . it be also find that certain blade profile be more susceptible to this type of behaviour , namely , symmetrical one .

@ord@ control of small-scale wind turbine to the casual observer , operate an efficient wind energy conversion system may seem a simple matter of attach an efficient turbine to an efficient generator and switch the system on . however , the key to produce a reasonable quantity of energy be not in the detail of the individual turbine blade or the generator , but in how the whole system be control . wind turbine can only work efficiently in a narrow band of speed which vary accord to the strength of the wind , as show in figure @card@ for wind speed range from @card@ m / S . thus , the power extract from the generator must be carefully control to maintain the turbine ' s optimal rotational speed . the optimal turbine speed over the range of wind speed be show by the cubic line in figure @card@ .

figure @card@ : power characteristic of a small-scale wind turbine
in order to export power to the national grid , a sophisticated piece of power electronics - know as a grid-tie inverter - must be use because of the strict regulation that govern the quality of power that can be transmit . the windboy inverter [ @card@ ] be compliant with these regulation and be fast become the industry standard for this application . it export power as a ( roughly ) linear function of turbine speed and so produce an operate line similar to the one show in figure @card@ . ( the inverter allow the gradient of this line to be adjust to permit the designer some leeway in tailor the inverter ' S characteristic to match that of an individual turbine . ) note that the windyboy ' s power characteristic be linear whereas the turbine ' S be cubic , mean that the system only achieve optimal power transfer at one rotational speed . if the turbine be operate at position ( @card@ ) , in a steady wind of @card@ m / S , and the wind speed abruptly change to 11m / S , the turbine suddenly produce a quantity of surplus of mechanical power , ∆p . this produce an accelerating torque that shift the turbine ' s operate point to position ( 2 ) along the windyboy ' s operate line . the speed of this transition depend on the turbine ' S inertia . the same mechanism operate in reverse if the wind speed drop . @ord@ model of small-scale wind energy conversion system model the wind energy conversion system show in figure @card@ require not only model of the turbine / generator / inverter system but also an accurate model of the wind itself . both of these component have be create in simulink . the turbine / generator / inverter model be verify by comparison with a generator / inverter system on test in the laboratory , while the wind model be validate by compare predict wind profile to real wind datum in the time and frequency domain . both model provide an accurate account of their respective real-world system . a very brief outline of the model be give below ; full detail can be find in [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . 2

the turbine and generator be mechanically connect , which mean any imbalance between the turbine torque and the electrical torque from the generator will cause the system to accelerate accord to equation ( @card@ ) .

where jr be the turbine inertia

dω @card@ = ( tmechanical − telectircal ) dt j r

the turbine ' S mechanical ( or aerodynamic ) torque , for a give wind speed and rotational speed , can be find from a turbine characteristic graph know as a cp-λ curve . the electrical brake torque create by the generator can be calculate by consider how much power the generator be produce at a give rotational speed . this in turn depend on the windyboy ' s operate characteristic as show in figure @ord@ the turbulent wind model be base around a random number generator which produce normally distribute white noise . since the wind speed can not ( for physical reason ) change instantaneously , the white noise must be smooth use a carefully design signal-shaping filter in order to achieve the correct spectral distribution . the shape filter be choose to good characterise the true spectrum of the wind , and implement in simulink use a second order transfer function with carefully tailor gain and time constant . @ord@ result of the simulation : potential control issue with main - connect " h " bladed vawts the full turbine / generator / inverter model be combine with the turbulent wind model to examine the effect of two different blade profile on the turbine ' S performance : a symmetrical naca0015 blade section and a camber s1210 blade section [ @card@ ] . the power curve create by these blade profile be show in the figure below , along with the windyboy load characteristic that be adopt in the simulation .

note that there be an initial negative portion in figure @card@ ( a ) , which correspond to an energy input . this mean that the turbine would not self-start and would require the generator to be run as a motor to spin it up to speed . the simulation be carry out at a mean wind speed of @card@ m / S . the power export from the inverter be plot alongside the turbulent wind input for @card@ second , figure @card@ .

figure @card@ : performance for the ( a ) naca0015 and ( b ) s1210 blade section in turbulent wind
figure @card@ show that the naca0015 blade section stall after approximately @card@ second when there be a sudden increase in wind speed , whilst the s1210 blade section continue to produce power for the full @card@ second . this behaviour can be predict from the power-speed characteristic of the two blade profile in figure @ord@ the power curve of the naca0015 section be very narrow and do not overlap . this mean if the wind speed increase suddenly , correspond to a jump from one power curve to another at constant speed , the turbine may move from the peak of one curve to the stall zone of the next , i.e. . as the wind speed increase , ∆p ( in figure @card@ ) be now negative rather then positive . there be therefore no available torque to accelerate the turbine and it stall - as observe in the simulation . this behaviour do not occur with the s1210 blade because the power curve do overlap , thus create a positive accelerating torque as the wind speed increase . @ord@ conclusion a turbulent wind model have be develop and combine with a small-scale wind turbine model to allow the performance of an entire turbine / generator / inverter system to be examine in turbulent wind . this procedure be carry out for two blade section that be consider in the design . of these , the naca0015 be find to be highly unstable in turbulent wind and would also have difficulty self-starting . the s1210 blade section suffer none of these problem and would therefore be the clear choice if a windyboy inverter be use in the system . alternatively , a symmetrical blade profile - such as the naca0015 could be use with a different inverter whose load characteristic be close to the ideal cubic relationship of the turbine ' S ( see figure @card@ ) . this be because the windyboy ' s linear load characteristic be a poor match for wind turbine ' s cubic relationship and so exacerbate any potential instability problem with the turbine design . @ord@ reference @ord@ dti , energy white paper : " our energy future - create a low carbon economy " , dti , february @card@ . @ord@ bumby , jr and martin , r ; " an axial flux , permanent magnet , air-cored generator for small scale wind turbine " , proc . iee - electrical power application , vol . @card@ , no . @card@ , sept @card@ , pp1065-1075 . @ord@ sma , ` ` windy boy grid tie inverter - operator manual addendum for the sunny boy 1800u / 2500u , ' ' sma America , October @card@ . @ord@ stannard , n.j. and j.r.

[ @card@ ] also use a genetic algorithm to maximize an economic function , which be relate to turbine parameter and location . similarly in ref .

@card@ . wind scenario @card@ the illustrative example use in this paper assume that the farm radius r ¼ @card@ ( m ) ; the wind characteristic of this example be describe in table @card@ , which be obtain from analyze historical wind datum . the datum in table @card@ can be read as follow : when wind direction be between 0 and 15 , the wind speed follow a weibull distribution with k ¼ @card@ , c ¼ @card@ ; the probability for wind blow between 0 and 15 be zero . similarly , when wind direction be between 90 and 105 , the wind speed follow a weibull distribution with k ¼ @card@ , c ¼ @card@ ; the probability for wind blow between 90 and 105 be @card@ . table @card@ show that wind blow predominantly from 75 to 105 with a probability of @card@ . to illustrate the algorithm ' s ability to optimize the wind farm layout , different number of turbine ( @card@ - @card@ turbine ) be consider . fig . @card@ show the optimal layout solution for different number of turbine . the optimal solution be obtain through mparent / mchild ¼ @card@ / @card@ , for @card@ generation . during the optimization process , the elite set size be limit to @ord@ when there be more than @card@ individual in the elite set , a cluster procedure be activate to delete individual with the same objective function value or similar geometric position . base on fig . @card@ , for two turbine to be place within the farm radius , the algorithm place the two turbine on the boundary of the circle . the line connect the two turbine appear to be perpendicular to the major wind direction ( 90 - 105 ) . when there be three turbine to be place , the algorithm position the two turbine ( low part of fig . @card@ ) across the major wind direction , and attempt to locate the third turbine as far as possible from the other two turbine , and to keep it from the wake of the other two turbine give the major wind direction .

as show in fig . @card@ , when there be @card@ , @card@ or @card@ turbine to be locate , the algorithm select the location , avoid the wake loss under the major wind direction . fig . @card@ show the initial population and the population at the 100th generation for the @card@ turbine . it be easy to see that the algorithm converge as the number of generation increase . however , @card@ generation be enough to converge for the datum use in this example .

fig . @ord@ six layout of turbine generate by use another initial population size .

for a large number of turbine , the search space expand due the increase number of individual in the es algorithm . thus increase the initial population size seem to be a viable way to search for optimal solution . fig . @card@ show two optimal solution generate with different population size . the triangle shape indicate the location generate when mparent / mchild ¼ @card@ / @card@ . the square shape show the location generate when mparent / mchild ¼ @card@ / @card@ . use mparent / mchild ¼ @card@ / @card@ , the algorithm can ﬁnd obj1 ¼1.1939 â 10à5 . use mparent / mchild ¼ @card@ / @card@ , the algorithm ﬁnds obj1 ¼1.1937 â 10à5 , which be a good value than in the case of a small initial population . note that increase the population size lead to good quality solution . it be worth mention that the tournament size should also be modiﬁed when the population size change .

while minimize the wake loss generate by the third turbine from the major wind direction . as in fig . @card@ , when there be @card@ , @card@ or @card@ turbine to be locate , the algorithm select the location , avoid the wake loss under the major wind direction . note that when the wind direction display a wide range , it be almost impossible for human heuristic to derive an optimal solution . in this case , a wind farm layout optimization tool be necessary for design turbine location . @card@ . wake loss if it be assume that there be no wake loss , the expect power can be calculate from equation ( @card@ ) by substitute ci ( . ) with c ( . ) in equation ( @card@ ) . in this scenario , optimal turbine location only need to satisfy the distance constraint .

thus equation ( @card@ ) can be regard as the ideal scenario where the maximum expect energy production from a wind turbine can be achieve . for a give number of turbine , equation ( @card@ ) can be use to calculate the ideal energy production for a wind farm without consider wake loss . once the wake loss be consider , add additional turbine to the wind farm may cause energy loss . table @card@ and @card@ be generate base on the two different wind scenario , @card@ and @card@ .

the datum in table @card@ be read as : when there be two turbine to be place in a wind farm , the optimize solution generate by the evolutionary algorithm provide @card@ kw of expect energy production ( note that the yearly production be not compute ) . if there be no wake loss , the ideal energy production be @card@ kw ; the potential wake loss under this layout solution be calculate by use @card@ à @card@ ¼ @card@ . table @card@ and @card@ show that as the number of turbine increase , the wake loss increase . fig . @card@ show that for two different wind scenario , the wake loss of wind scenario @card@ be similar to the wake loss of wind scenario @card@ when the number of turbine be @card@ - 5 . when the number of turbine be @card@ , the wake loss of wind scenario @card@ be signiﬁcantly high than that of wind scenario @ord@ the reason be obvious , as wind scenario @card@ include a wide range of wind direction with a certain probability . however , in wind scenario @card@ , the wind direction be limit to 75 - 105 ; other wind direction have almost zero probability , which make it easy to place turbine and avoid wake loss . base on fig . @card@ , for a give wind farm radius , it be obvious that there should be some limit on the number of turbine to be place on a farm . locate too many turbine will signiﬁcantly increase wake loss . base on the constraint list in model ( @card@ ) , place @card@ turbine within a wind farm of a 500-m radius be not possible . the

although a global optimal solution be not guarantee , the quality of the generate solution be acceptable for industrial application . future research can focus on consider different terrain , e.g. . , the terrain height information could be incorporate into the model . furthermore , wind turbine parameter selection could be consider base on the wind farm wind characteristic . for example , for a low wind speed area , there be no need to select large turbine with a high cut-in speed . in other word , it be desirable to maximize the wind turbine capacity utilization factor subject to investment and operational constraint .

@card@ cfd result the calculation start on the normal mesh , after that , the local grid refinement be perform in boundary layer region until grid independent solution be attain . the final y+ for grid independent solution be find to be about @card@ and low . the comparison of generator power be show in fig.6 . the cfd result show reasonably good agreement with experimental datum . the solution with k- ε turbulence model underpredicted the experiment datum by @card@ % and @card@ % at wind speed @card@ m / S and @card@ m / S , respectively . the rather large percentage error at low speed could be attributable to the uncertainty in the experimental correlation in this region , as can be see from fig . @ord@ the power output in this region be small , so any small absolute error due to correlation could make a large contribution to the percentage error . the inviscid calculation , while generally appear to be very reasonable , overpredict the experiment ; this be anticipate since inviscid flow lack viscous drag . fig . @card@ show the comparison of pressure coefficient . the numerical solution , both inviscid and viscous case , be quite close to experimental datum at @card@ % span . at @card@ % span , however , both predict result be not in good agreement with the experiment because of the effect of flow separation due to the high angle of attack . the velocity flow field be show in fig.8 , the flow be attach to the blade at @card@ % span , but be separate at @card@ % span . fortunately , this pressure error do not highly affect the power output because it occur at inner blade span which contribute little to the total power output . with some confidence in the validity of cfd , the pitch be now vary to see its effect . the simulation with viscous effect be select because of its high accuracy . the predict power at various blade pitch angle for both wind speed @card@ m / S and @card@ m / s be show in fig @ord@ rough " eye-balling " estimate seem to give optimal pitch at @card@ and @card@ degree for the wind speed @card@ m / S and @card@ m / S , respectively . the good method to estimate the optimum pitch angle be by use curve fitting . from the method of least square with polynomial degree @card@ ( equation show in fig.6 ) , the optimum blade pitch be determine to be at @card@ degree for wind speed @card@ m / S and @card@ degree for wind speed @card@ m / S . @card@ correlation analysis for optimal pitch the computation have show that the pitch , hence angle of attack , strongly affect turbine power output . the angle of attack can be calculate from the simple relation :

α = arctan

u∞  ωr

  −θp 

( @card@ )

where α be angle of attack , θ p be blade pitch angle and r be the local radius of blade . at the design point of untwisted blade , normally at @card@ % span , the angle of attack corresponding to the optimal point be compute as 10.25o and 9.06o for wind speed @card@ m / S and @card@ m / S , respectively . experimental lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio versus angle of attack be show in fig . @ord@ the value 10.25o and 9.06o be very close to the maximum lift in pre-stall region ( about 9.5o ) . moreover , the high value of angle of attack for the high speed case also correlate with the rightward shift trend of the curve for high reynolds number . fig @card@ ( b ) dictate that optimal lift to drag be nominally at @card@ degree . unlike aircraft wing which be often design at the maximum lift to drag point , the wind turbine seem to be optimal at the maximum lift point . this be quite consistent with the blade element theory which indicate that power depend strongly on lift and relatively weakly on lift to drag ratio .

@ord@ conclusion
cfd be use to predict the optimal blade pitch angle that give maximum power for wind turbine . for wind speed @card@ m / S and @card@ m / s , optimal pitch occur at @card@ degree and @card@ degree respectively . both value , when examine at @card@ % span , correlate to the maximum lift point in pre-stall region . this , perhaps , could be use as a design criterion for an untwisted blade horizontal axis wind turbine .

financial structure and term @card@ technical specification @card@ a ) overview @card@ b ) experience @card@ c ) special consideration @card@ d ) proposal specification @card@ specification requirement @card@ project scope to consult , design , test and assemble a @card@ mw wind power farm in a suitable area of the western united state . the generate power will be sell to the usa electric grid , or to local consumer . this project will be execute as a joint venture with enerquest power development corporation . all proposal should emphasize those policy issue that would give the joint-venture good chance for approval ( i.e. . : new , inventive solution , technology transfer , worker ' training , alternative process , local equipment procurement , export potential , etc . ) . project background advance \d4wind energy project provide cost-effective and reliable energy in the unite state and abroad . the u.s. wind industry currently generate about @card@ billion kilowatt-hour of electricity each year -- enough to meet the annual electricity need of @card@ million people . wind energy installation be go up across the country as utility realize the benefit of add clean , low-cost , reliable wind energy to their resource portfolio . advance \d4the u.s. department of energy and nrel be help bring wind energy , a clean , low-cost generation option , to the marketplace in the unite state and abroad . activity such as the wind energy deployment project , international cooperative project and technical assistance , and standard development all help hasten the adoption of wind energy technology . advance \d4the electricity generate by wind turbine be use for many application , from large , utility-scale power plant , to small , single turbine for home or village use . wind energy ' S popularity be grow because of its many benefit : wind energy generate pollution-free electricity ; the fuel source , wind , blow steadily in many area ; wind energy cost compete with conventional fossil-fueled power plant in some area ; and cost continue to drop as technology improve . environmental issue advance \d4wind energy be consider a green power technology because it have only minor impact on the environment . wind energy plant produce no air pollutant or greenhouse gas . however , any means of energy production impact the environment in some way , and wind energy be no different . aesthetics and visual impact : element that influence visual impact include the spacing , design , and uniformity of the turbine . bird and other live resource : pre-construction survey can indicate whether bird or other live resource be likely to be affect by wind turbine . global warming : wind energy can help fight global warming . wind turbine produce no air emission or greenhouse gas . lightning : ongoing research and increase operator experience be improve the understanding of lightning and wind turbine . noise : like all mechanical system , wind turbine produce some noise when they operate . in recent year , engineer have make design change to reduce the noise from wind turbine . tv / radio interference : in the past , old turbine with metal blade cause television interference in area near the turbine . interference from modern turbine be unlikely because many component formerly make of metal be now make from composite . advance \d4wind resource the wind be the fuel source for wind energy . the unite state have many area with abundant wind , particularly in the Midwest and great plain . understand the wind resource be a crucial step in plan a wind energy project . detailed knowledge of the wind at a site be need to estimate the performance of a wind energy project . wind energy be very abundant in many part of the unite state . wind resource be characterize by wind-power density class , range from class @card@ ( the low ) to class @card@ ( the high ) . good wind resource ( class @card@ and above ) which have an average annual wind speed of at least @card@ mile per hour , be find along the east coast , the Appalachian mountain chain , the great plain , the pacific northwest , and some other location . north dakota , alone , have enough energy from class @card@ and high wind to supply @card@ % of the electricity of the low @card@ state . of course , it would be impractical to move electricity everywhere from north dakota . wind speed be a critical feature of wind resource , because the energy in wind be proportional to the cube of the wind speed . in other word , a strong wind mean a lot more power . political issue : wind project site face unique hurdle : despite it ' s status as the fast grow renewable energy source , wind power face numerous obstacle in site and permit . this be true for both large project be build to sell power to utility and small project be build for a single user . regulation and law govern power project site be become ever more complex , and state and federal site agency be not as likely to approve power project without extensive review . various interest group have become more involved in site procedure as well . large wind project raise many of the same site issue as other energy project . there may be concern about truck traffic during construction , health effect of electromagnetic field from transmission line and social issue . wind project also face some unique challenge that require special consideration . land use : unlike most power plant , wind generation project be not land intensive . on a mw output basis , the land require for a wind project exceed the amount of land require for most other energy technology , but the physical project footprint cover only a small portion of that land . for example , a @card@ mw wind facility may occupy a @card@ , 500-acre site , but it will only use three to five percent of the total acreage , leave the remainder available for other use . because wind generation be limit to area with strong and fairly consistent wind resource , most wind generation be site in rural and relatively open area that be often already use for agriculture , grazing , recreation , forest management or seasonal flood storage . to ensure that a wind project be compatible with exist land use , the layout and design of the wind project can be adjust in a variety of way , include : select equipment with minimal guide wire place electrical collection line underground place maintenance facility off site consolidate equipment on the turbine tower or foundation consolidate structure within a selected area use the most efficient or large turbine to minimize the number of turbine require increase turbine space to reduce density of machine use road-less construction and maintenance technique , or use existing access road . other land use strategy include use buffer zone and setback to separate wind project from sensitive or incompatible land use . land use agency in california have establish setback range from two to four time the height of a turbine or a minimum of @card@ to @card@ , @card@ foot from any residential area . Minnesota have establish minimum setback of @card@ foot from occupied dwelling . advance \d4 what be the advantage of wind-generated electricity ? numerous public opinion survey have consistently show that the public prefer wind and other renewable energy form to conventional source of generation . wind energy be a free , renewable resource , so no matter how much be use today , there will still be the same supply in the future . wind energy be also a source of clean , non-pollute , electricity . unlike conventional power plant , wind plant emit no air pollutant or greenhouse gas . in @card@ , California ' s wind power plant offset the emission of more than @card@ billion pound of carbon dioxide , and @card@ million pound of other pollutant that would have otherwise be produce . it would take a forest of @card@ million to @card@ million tree to provide the same air quality . advance \d4 what be the economic obstacle to great wind power usage ? even though the cost of wind power have decrease dramatically in the past @card@ year , the technology require a high initial investment than fossil-fueled generator . roughly @card@ % of the cost be the machinery , with the balance be the site preparation and installation . if wind-generating system be compare with fossil-fueled system on a ` ` life-cycle ' ' cost basis ( count fuel and operate expense for the life of the generator ) , however , wind cost be more competitive with other generating technology because there be no fuel to purchase and minimal operate expense . advance \d4 be there other drawback to the use of wind energy ? the major challenge to use wind as a source of power be that it be intermittent and it do not always blow when electricity be need . wind can not be store ( unless battery be use ) ; and not all wind can be harness to meet the timing of electricity demand . further , good wind site be often locate in remote location far from area of electric power demand ( such as city ) . finally , wind resource development may compete with other use for the land and those alternative use may be more highly value than electricity generation . however , wind turbine can be locate on land that be also use for grazing or even farm . advance \d4 be the cost of wind power competitive with conventional power plant ? new , utility-scale , wind project be be build all around the unite state today with energy cost range from @card@ cent per kilowatt-hour ( at very windy site in texas ) to @card@ cent or more ( in the pacific northwest ) . these cost be competitive with the direct operate cost of many conventional form of electricity generation now -- and price be expect to drop even further over the next @card@ year . since wind be an intermittent electricity generator and do not provide power on an ` ` as needed ' ' basis , it have to compare favorably with the cost save on fuel from fossil generator . advance \d4 can homeowner sell excess electricity to the utility ? under the public utility regulatory policy act of @card@ ( purpa ) , any qualify individual can install a wind generator and the local electric utility must pay for any excess power produce . purpa be specifically intend to create a market for clean , renewable , electric-generate technology by guarantee a buyer for the excess power . prior to purpa , sell power to the utility be an option but be the discretion of the utility . with purpa , small power producer meet specific criterion be guarantee purchase and interconnection . many state now permit ` ` net meter , ' ' in which the utility must buy wind power generate by homeowner at the same retail rate the utility charge . this essentially allow the customer ' s meter to turn backward while wind energy be supply to the grid by the customer ' S turbine . economic issue although the nation ' s wind potential be very large , only part of it can be exploit economically . the economic viability of wind power will vary from utility to utility . important factor not address in this study that influence land availability and wind electric potential include production / demand match ( seasonal and daily ) , transmission and access constraint , public acceptance , and other technological and institutional constraint . advance \d4to provide @card@ % of the nation ' S electricity , only about @card@ % of the land of the low @card@ state would have to be develop with wind turbine . furthermore , wind turbine , electrical equipment , and access road would occupy less than @card@ % of this land . most existing land use , such as farm and ranch , could remain as it be now . advance \d4 be wind energy good for the economy ? wind energy avoid the external or societal cost associate with conventional resource , namely , the trade deficit from import foreign oil and other fuel , the health and environmental cost of pollution , and the cost of deplete resource . wind energy be a domestic , reliable resource that provide more job per dollar invest than any other energy technology -- more than five time that from coal or nuclear power . in @card@ , wind turbine and component manufacturer contribute directly to the economy of @card@ state , create thousand of job for American . advance \d4 the u.s. electric power industry be a combination of electric utility ( investor-own , publicly own , cooperative , and federal ) and non-utility power producer . investor-own electric utility account for over three-fourth of the sale of electricity and revenue in the industry . historically , the investor-own electric utility serve the large consolidated market and operate in all state except nebraska . Hawaii be the only state in which all electricity be supply by investor-own electric utility . advance \d4publicly own electric utility be nonprofit operation that have be establish to serve their community and nearby consumer at cost . the publicly own electric utility in this publication include municipal , public power district , state authority , irrigation district , and other state organization . publicly own electric utility be exempt from tax and can obtain new financing at low rate than investor-own electric utility . advance \d4the publicly own electric utility be divide into generator and non-generators ( in contrast , virtually all investor-own electric utility own and operate generating capacity ) . generator be those electric utility that have investment in electric utility plant and production to supply some or all of their consumer need . however , many generator can supplement their demand by purchasing power . the non-generators can not produce electric power for end use and rely exclusively on purchasing power . their primary function be to transmit and distribute electricity to their consumer . the non-generators comprise over half of the total number of major publicly own electric utility . advance \d4cooperative electric utility be own by their member and be establish to provide electricity to those member . the rural electrification administration ( prior to the rural utility service ) , u.s. department of agriculture , be establish under the rural electrification act of @card@ with the purpose to extend electric service to small rural community ( usually under @card@ , @card@ consumer ) and farm where it be more expensive to provide service . the national rural utility cooperative finance corporation , the federal financing bank , and the bank for cooperative be the most important source of debt financing for cooperative . cooperative borrower ( @card@ of @card@ in @card@ total cooperative ) currently operate in @card@ state . financial datum for the cooperative borrower be find in the statistical report , rural electric borrower publish by the rural utility service of the u.s. department of agriculture . federal electric utility be also present in this publication and include the four federal power-marketing administration , the tennessee valley authority , and the u.s. bureau of Indian affair . the four federal power-marketing administration be the bonneville power administration , the southeastern power administration , the southwestern power administration , and the western area power administration . primarily water resource generate electric power produce by federal electric utility . this power , which be not produce for profit , be primarily sell in the wholesale market to other electric utility rather than be distribute to ultimate consumer . as require by law , publicly own and cooperative electric utility be give preference in the purchase of this less expensive power produce by the federal electric utility . advance \d4 industry profile : key fact of sale and revenue in @card@ be : the @card@ , @card@ publicly own electric utility , which account for close to two-third of all electric utility , account for @card@ percent of all revenue from sale to ultimate consumer and @card@ percent of all revenue from sale for resale . the @card@ cooperative electric utility ( more than a quarter of all electric utility ) account for @card@ percent of all revenue from sale to ultimate consumer and @card@ percent of all revenue from sale for resale . the @card@ federal electric utility account for @card@ percent of all revenue from sale to ultimate consumer and @card@ percent of all revenue from sale for resale . the average ultimate consumer revenue per kilowatt-hour range from @card@ to @card@ cent depend on the type of electric utility service them . the overall average be @card@ cent . the average sale for resale revenue per kilowatt-hour range from @card@ to @card@ cent , depend on the type of electric utility make the sale . the overall average be @card@ cent . economic context : economic growth characterize @card@ with the real gross domestic product ( gdp ) grow by @card@ percent , a slight decrease from @card@ percent in @ord@ economic expansion maintain considerable momentum during @ord@ this be the fourth year in a row in which the federal reserve use minimal intervention to stimulate the economy . another sign of the sturdy economy be that industrial production index increase a robust @card@ percent last year . the consumer price index ( cpi ) rise a slight @card@ percent during @card@ , up slightly from @card@ percent in @ord@ capacity utilization be @card@ percent for @ord@ this represent the eighth year in a row where the measure of economic activity as a percent of capacity have be over @card@ percent . advance \d4 generator electric utility versus non-generator electric utility : the next section of the publication discuss generator and non-generator electric utility separately . the two group be distinct because of operational difference result in significantly different financial pro-files . for example , significant plant production expense would not exist for non-generator electric utility because exist production plant expense be mainly maintenance cost for standby plant . it should be note that both generator and non-generator electric utility report accord to vary fiscal year that be determine by their political locality . because non-generator electric utility purchase all their power need , they have less plant investment than generator electric utility per dollar of revenue generate . in @card@ , generator electric utility have $ @card@ of electric utility plant ( without nuclear fuel ) per dollar of electric utility operate revenue , com-pared with $ @card@ for non-generator electric utility . operation and maintenance ( o & m ) expense represent very different cost between the two group of electric utility . purchase power expense , which comprise the majority of non-generators ' o & m expense , contain all the associate cost for the generate plant from which the power be purchase , include depreciation . this cause non-generators ' o & m expense to appear high than generator ' o & m expense on a mill per kilowatt-hour basis . in @card@ , non-generators ' o & m expense be @card@ percent of revenue and depreciation be only @card@ percent . for generator , depreciation of plant be show directly , since all or their own plant meet some of their generating need . generator ' o & m expense represent only @card@ percent of revenue , but depreciation be @card@ percent of revenue . financing be also different for the two group . generator electric utility , with their large plant investment per dollar of revenue , have more debt per dollar of revenue than non-generator electric utility . the large amount of debt create great interest expense . interest expense represent @card@ percent of revenue in @card@ for the generator versus just @card@ percent of revenue for the non-generators ( table @card@ and @card@ ) . wind power incentive in the u.s. :

abstract the basic principle of wind turbine convert wind energy into electricity come from the lift produce by the air flow through the rotor . the shape of rotor blade play an important role in determine the overall aerodynamic performance of a horizontal axis wind turbine . in this work , blade be design for a 5kw horizontal axis wind turbine which be already in market . for design blade , blade element momentum theory ( bemt ) be use and a computer program be develop to automate the complete procedure . two naca airfoil be take for the comparative calculation of elemental power coefficient and other parameter such as chord , thickness and twist distribution . the airfoil take for design the blade be same from root to tip . stress be maximum at the blade root . in this work , the blade root be thick portion of the blade and twist be maintain such that the angle of attack will be maximum at every station of the blade . in the design blade , the elemental power coefficient be maximum in transition segment . the present method be useful for predict the performance of wind turbine blade . keywords : power coefficient , twist , chord , airfoil , design . @ord@ introduction the power efficiency of wind energy system have a high impact in the economic analysis of this kind of renewable energy . the efficiency in these system depend on many subsystem : blade , gearbox , electric generator and control . some factor involve in blade efficiency be the wind feature , like its probabilistic distribution , the mechanical interaction of blade with the electric generator , and the strategy deal with pitch and rotational speed control . it be a complex problem involve many factor , relation and constraint . the increase awareness of the general public to climate change and global warming have provide opportunity for wind turbine application in the uk . the Uk claim @card@ % of the wind energy resource of europe . study of Ackermann , ( @card@ ) show europe lead the world with @card@ % ( 23gw peak ) of the total operational wind power capacity world wide . as well as large wind turbine operate in open area on- and off-shore , more small-scale wind turbine be be install and operate by homeowner and small enterprise . one of the difference between large- and small-scale wind turbine be that small-scale wind turbine be generally locate where the power be require , often within a build environment , rather than where the wind be most favorable . in such location , the wind be normally weak , turbulent and unstable in term of direction and speed , because of the presence of building and other adjacent obstruction . to yield a reasonable power output from a small-scale wind turbine locate in this turbulent environment , and to justify such an installation economically , the turbine have to improve their energy capture , particularly at low wind speed and be responsive to change in wind direction . this mean that small-scale turbine need to be specifically design to work effectively in low and turbulent wind resource area . accord to spera , ( @card@ ) the glauert and wilson method be mostly use for blade design . the objective of these method be to obtain the maximum power coefficient of each blade section at the design wind speed . because the time variation characteristic of wind speed be not take into account , blade design by these method can not achieve the maximum annual energy output . furthermore , design result from these method must be substantially amend to get smooth chord length and twist

@card@ airfoil property in this work , two airfoil be take , one of them be four digit and the other be five digit airfoil . theory of wing section by Abbott , ( @card@ ) be use for take the property of airfoil . the selection of airfoil be very important point in design an efficient rotor . grifith , ( @card@ ) show that the output power be greatly affect by the airfoil lift-to-drag ratio , while hassanein , ( @card@ ) recommend that the airfoil be select accord to its location along the blade to ensure its high contribution to the overall performance . the number system for naca wing section of the four-digit series be base on the section geometry . the first integer indicate the maximum value of the mean-line ordinate yc in per cent of the chord . the second integer indicate the distance from the lead edge to the location of the maximum camber in tenth of the chord . the last two integer indicate the section thickness in per cent of the chord . thus the naca @card@ wing section have @card@ per cent camber at @card@ of the chord from the lead edge and be @card@ per cent thick . the number system for wing section of the naca five-digit ( @card@ ) series be base on a combination of theoretical aerodynamic characteristic and geometric characteristic . the first integer indicate the amount of camber in term of the relative magnitude of the design lift coefficient ; the design lift coefficient in tenth be thus three-halves of the first integer . the second and third integer together indicate the distance from the lead edge to the location of the maximum camber ; this distance in per cent of the chord be one-half the number represent by these integer . the last two integer indicate the section thickness in per cent of the chord . @ord@ the blade element - momentum ( bem ) theory the basic assumption in blade element momentum theory be that the force of the blade element be solely responsible for the change of momentum in the air which pass through the annulus sweep by the blade element . it be therefore to be assume that there be no radial interaction between the flow through contiguous annulus - a condition that be strictly only true if the axial flow induction factor do not vary radially . in practice , the axial flow induction factor be seldom uniform but experimental examination of flow through propeller disk by lock ( @card@ ) show that the assumption of the radial independence be acceptable . the component of aerodynamic force on n blade element resolve in the axial direction be

the rate of change of axial momentum of the air pass through the sweep annulus be

it be argue by wilson and lissaman ( @card@ ) that the drag coefficient should not be include in eq . ( @card@ ) and ( @card@ ) because the velocity deficit cause by drag be confine to the narrow wake which flow from the trail edge of the aerofoil . furthermore , wilson and lissaman reason , the drag-based velocity deficit be only a feature of the wake and do not contribute to the velocity deficit upstream of the rotor disc . the basis of the argument for exclude drag in the determination of the flow induction factor be that , for attach flow , drag be cause only by skin friction and do not affect the pressure drop across the rotor . clearly , in stall flow the drag be overwhelmingly cause by pressure . in attach flow it have be show by young and squire ( @card@ ) that the modification to the inviscid pressure distribution around an aerofoil cause by the boundary layer have an affect both on lift and drag . the ratio of pressure drag to total drag at zero angle of attack be approximately the same as the thickness to chord ratio of the aerofoil and increase as the angle of attack increase . one last point about the bem theory : the theory be strictly only applicable if the blade have uniform circulation , i.e. . , if a be uniform . for non-uniform circulation there be a radial interaction and exchange of momentum between flow through adjacent elemental annular ring . it can not be state that the only axial force act on the flow through a give annular ring be that due to the pressure drop across the disc . however , in practice , it appear that the error involve in relax the above constraint be small for tip speed ratio great than @ord@ the complete procedure can be write as : ( i ) guess a and a ' ( a = a ' = @card@ be acceptable to start Hau ( @card@ ) ) ; ( ii ) calculate φ form

@ord@ conclusion this paper present the investigation of blade performance for a @card@ kw horizontal axis wind turbine base on blade element momentum theory . the most difficult issue for the bem theory be : mathematical representation of the correct lift and drag coefficient value and correct evaluation of the axial and tangential induction factor . the blade have constant lift to drag ratio corresponding to all element be investigate . two naca airfoil be take in this work ( the four digit one and the five digit one ) . for the selected airfoil and the blade number , the chord , thickness and twist decrease as we move from root to tip . at the blade root , chord and thickness attain their maximum value . twist be maintain in such a manner that the angle of attack give the maximum lift coefficient . chord distribution be same for both airfoil at all tip speed ratio . twist distribution be different in both airfoil at different tip speed ratio . the value of elemental power coefficient be maximum for element where r / r vary from @card@ to @card@ . the nature of the flow pattern around an aerofoil be determine by the reynolds number and this significantly affect the value of the lift and drag coefficient . the power coefficient of a rotor vary with the tip speed ratio ( the ratio of rotor tip speed to free wind speed ) and be only a maximum for a unique tip speed ratio . the maximum power coefficient that can be achieve in the presence of drag be significantly less than the betz limit at all tip speed ratio . drag reduce the power coefficient at high tip speed ratio . structural and cfd analysis of the design blade can also be do . nomenclature

the effect of blade pitch on small multi-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbine the effect of blade pitch on small multi-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbine m . curtis rector and dr. kenneth visser department of mechanical and aeronautical engineering the general goal in optimize the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine be to increase power extraction with a minimal increase to the overall cost of the system . for this reason , utility scale wind turbine be optimize for least cost , since they be equip with large , very expensive blade . it be believe , however , that the idea of aerodynamic optimization could play a large role in the efficiency of small wind turbine , as these extreme cost do not apply on horizontal-axis wind turbine ( hawt ' S ) more suit for small utility such as home use . the goal of this study be to optimize the performance of small hawt ' S by examine the effect of blade pitch on turbine with more than three blade . the optimization of a wind turbine ' s aerodynamic performance rely on many factor and variable , include blade number ( b ) ; rotor solidity ( σ ) , the ratio of blade area to sweep area ; blade pitch ( β ) , the angle between the chord line and the plane of rotation ; and tip speed ratio ( λ ) , the ratio of peripheral tip speed to wind speed . aerodynamic performance of small hawt ' S have be an active research topic at clarkson over the past few year . initial numerical study investigate the implication of solidity and blade number and have since be test experimentally in the clarkson wind tunnel and at a full-scale level at the clarkson university wind turbine test site , locate at the potsdam airport . the full scale experiment , compare a standard three-blade bergey xl.1 with an experimental prototype six-blade turbine , show an increase in power extraction at low wind speed for increase blade number and solidity . the prototype have also show that its great torque result in lower operational tip speed ratio , a decrease tip speed ratio at maximum power coefficient ( Cp ) , the ratio of extract power to the power in the wind , and reduce cut-in wind speed . the impact of blade pitch angle be a critical parameter for the aerodynamic optimization of untwisted blade . the numerical study perform earlier for multi-bladed turbine include this parameter , as well , indicate a turbine with a @card@ ° blade pitch angle result in a @card@ % great Cp than one at @card@ ° . they also suggest an increase tip speed ratio at maximum Cp for a reduce blade pitch angle , greatly affect the tip speed ratio range of operation . this thesis examine the effect of blade pitch on a six-bladed turbine in an effort to optimize its aerodynamic performance so as to extract the great power and energy production for give wind condition . since this thesis be intend to complement the full-scale research regard small hawt ' S , data be be acquire at the clarkson university wind turbine test site . the site include a silo , a meteorological tower and two fully operation 1kw wind turbine . a meteorological tower , locate approximately @card@ meter upwind of the two test turbine , be equip with three anemometer to measure wind speed at height of @card@ , @card@ and @card@ meter . pressure , temperature and humidity be measure at @card@ meter and correct to the hub height of both turbine . the first of the two turbine , picture in figure 1a , be that of an unmodified Bergey xl.1 , and be use as the control for the experiment . this @card@ bladed , horizontal-axis , upwind style wind turbine have a @card@ % solidity , blade diameter of @card@ m , and estimated blade pitch angle of @card@ ° . it be position at a height of @card@ m , approximately @card@ blade diameter away from the prototype , perpendicular to the prevailing wind . the experimental prototype , picture in figure 1b , be also a Bergey xl.1 , modify to accept multiple blade at various pitch angle . in its current modified state , this turbine be a @card@ bladed , horizontal axis , upwind style wind turbine have @card@ % solidity and blade diameter of @card@ m . a hub attachment be design to enable the @card@ blade configuration , which will remain throughout these study , and variable pitch angle that be manually adjust through the use of metal shim . all other aspect of the prototype turbine have remain unchanged from the as-bought condition in an effort to maintain uniformity with the control . both turbine have be install as separate system , each consist of identical resistive load bank , length and grade of wire and safety equipment . datum from the turbine and meteorological tower be collect every second and store in a computer house inside the test silo . the datum acquisition system , within , use two national instrument pci-6024e daq board with a bnc-2120 interface in conjunction with labview 6.0i . current and voltage transducer locate at the resistive load bank be use to determine power , and rpm be calculate from the frequency in the voltage signal . the resistive load bank , replace what would be a battery charge unit during normal use , allow manual adjustment of the load between @card@ and @card@ ohm , for a more controlled study . analysis procedure follow the nerl performance test plan for a wind turbine very similar to the Bergey xl.1 use on site , along with the test procedure develop by advanced wind turbine incorporate . the acquire datum be sort accord to wind speed into bin @card@ m / s wide , with bin center locate at half-integer multiple . from these average bin , power curve be then generate for each resistance value test . performance curve of power coefficient versus tip speed ratio and total energy be also create to compare and analyze the overall performance of the turbine . the present study be investigate the impact of @card@ ° and @card@ ° blade pitch angle , as datum have previously be obtain for a @card@ ° pitch angle . since resistive load directly impact the power output of the wind turbine , resistance range between @card@ and @card@ ohm be test to represent a range of high-to-low load condition . as can be see in figure @card@ , the prototype have great torque be able to operate at a high load for a give wind speed , so a comparison of identical load do not reflect optimum condition for either turbine . figure @card@ compare the @card@ ohm and @card@ ohm case for a @card@ ° blade pitch angle . as the load increase from @card@ ohm to @card@ ohm , the rotor speed decrease on the control , close the difference in energy extraction between the two turbine . figure @card@ display the overall power curve for each turbine , represent the optimum power output at a give wind speed . the result show the prototype turbine able to produce a great power output than the control at low wind speed , under @card@ m / S , while the reverse be true for wind speed great than @card@ m / S . the energy extraction of each turbine for a give month , June @card@ , be illustrate in figure @ord@ the improve power of the prototype at low wind speed result in a great extraction of energy than the control turbine at these speed . although it be not clearly evident from the figure , the wind speed average @card@ m / s and below for more than @card@ % of the month . compare the total energy extraction for the give month , the as-bought Bergey xl.1 produce @card@ kw·hr more than the prototype . class of @card@ , mechanical engineering , clarkson university , honors program , oral presentation

introduction over the past few year , interest in the use of windmill to produce power

have grow significantly .

in support of this interest , considerable research

have be direct toward the measurement and prediction of wind turbine performance . the majority of the theoretical effort employ thus far be

base on a variety of method that have long be use in the calculation of propeller performance ; classical momentum theory along with a number of bladeelement theory have be utilize with vary degree of success . a computer code develop by wilson and walker at Oregon state university , [ @card@ ] , and entitle prop , be at present widely use to determine the aerodynamic performance of horizontal axis wind turbine . this code be develop several year ago as a general purpose wind turbine performance computer program . flexibility . accordingly , prop have a certain amount of built-in

for example , the code contain four blade tip-loss model

( nasa , prandtl , Goldstein , and no tip-loss ) which can be incorporate into the performance prediction ; however , the choice of which model to use be leave to the user ' S discretion . the prop code be base on a modified blade element analysis call the glauert vortex theory [ @card@ ] . an essential assumption of this theory be that

vortex originate from the rotate blade to form a helical vortex system that pass downstream . of fundamental importance , this trail vortex

system induce velocity which alter the flow around the blade and in turn affect the force act on the blade . it should be note that because of

the complexity involve the induce velocity be not determine directly in the glauert vortex theory . instead , axial and radial interference factor be

calculate from which the induce velocity of the vortex system on any blade element can be evaluate . the calculation of these interference factor be

3

simplify by assume that the rotor have an infinite number of blade . this assumption remove the complexity associate with the periodicity of the
,

blade flow and permit direct application of momentum theory for the evaluation of the interference velocity . however , for single and double-bladed

rotor , of principal interest here , this assumption be questionable . user of the prop code have frequently encounter problem with the convergence of the numerical procedure in the program . it have be find

that under certain operate condition of a wind turbine , particularly those for large tip speed ratio ( generally small wind velocity ) , the local value of the axial interference factor can exceed a theoretically limit value for all tip-loss model . when the axial interference factor lie in the range @card@ / @card@ state .
~

a

~

@card@ , this state be know as a turbulence wake or vortex ring

under such a condition , the velocity in the fully develop wake therefore , the

will then reverse direction and flow back toward the rotor .

momentum-blade element theory cease to be valid , and it be then necessary to modify the analysis by use glauert ' s empirical datum . these empirical correction have be develop for the momentum-blade element theory and discuss in some detail in [ @card@ , 3j , however , theoretical performance estimation in the region be suspect even when correct by empirical method . experience have also reveal from comparison of prop code prediction with experimental datum that for all blade tip-loss model , prop result tend to underestimate measured power output both near ` ` cut-in ' ' and rate wind speed . because of the inherent limitation with the momentum-blade element theory and because of the need to develop an analytical method for predict the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine with a small number of blade , it be decide that a different and more complete method of anlysis be in

4

order .

the purpose of this report be to describe the development of the

method which be term a vortex wake model . in the analysis , the induce velocity be directly calculate by integration of the biot-savart law under the assumption that a filament of the trail vortex be helical in form , extend infinitely downstream of the rotor , and have a constant diameter . it be also assume that the helical

vortex system produce at the blade be travel downstream with a constant velocity . this velocity be equal to the value at the rotor blade , i.e. . , the inflow velocity through rotor ' s plane of rotation . interaction between wake element be ignore . use to model the blade . an analysis and a computer program for predict the aerodynamic performance of a horizontal wind turbine by use a vortex wake method have also be develop by r . h . miller , et al [ @card@ ] . the difference between that this imply that the

ihe lifting line theory be

analysis and the present one be in the modeling of the circulation around the blade and in the vortex wake and in the method of integrate the biot-savart law to evaluate local induce velocity . blade be model as a step function . in [ @card@ ] , the bound circulation for

this mean that each blade be divide

into a number of spanwise section , which be , in general , of unequal length . each blade section be then represent by a bound line vortex of constant strength . since jump discontinuties exist in circulation between adjacent

spanwise blade section , a trail line vortex must be generate at each of these point . these helical vortex be further approximate by a series of straight line vortex segment , each span an angle of @card@ ° or @card@ ° over which integration be perform . in the current analysis , a continuous vari-

ation of circulation in the spanwise direction be use and the integration be

5

perform for the whole helical vortex sheet in the trail wake to evaluate the local induce velocity .

,

the method develop be find to be very flexible and be capable of accurately predict ` ` cut-in ' ' speed and wind turbine output power . the

method can handle rotor have any number of blade and the blade may be arbitrarily shape and twist . however , this study will concentrate on one

and two-bladed rotor with blade geometry appropriate to nasa wind turbine
[ @card@ , 5j .

it should also be mention that , although the analysis present in the report be limit to steady uniform flow , the technique can be readily extend to non-steady wind with shear flow and to the case of an expand wake . because the method propose herein be base on a propeller model and because prop also be base on a number of propeller model , it be feel that a brief review of some propeller theory as apply to wind turbine be appropriate . hence , momentum theory , blade element theory and vortex theory

will all be briefly discuss in appendix a . in the following , the present method , which be base on the vortex theory of propeller along with Moriya ' s theory [ 6j , will be describe . discussion

will be give as to how Moriya ' S theory may be implement in determine wind turbine performance . result of a number of calculation will be comfinally , the method will be use to

pare with exist experimental datum .

predict the performance of a single-bladed rotor .

analysis

@card@ introduction to vortex theory from ideal flow theory it may be recall that vorticity be define as twice the angular velocity of an element of fluid . a region contain a

concentrated amount of vorticity be call a vortex and a vortex be say to have a strength equal to the circulation around the vortex area . helmholtz

theorem [ @card@ ] be a set of proposition that apply to vortex and vortex mechanic . one theorem state that in an inviscid flow within which the

force be conservative and the pressure be only a function of density , rotation of fluid particle , which travel along stream line , be permanent . from this theorem , often refer to as the vortex continuity theorem , it become evident that a vortex filament can not end abruptly , and , unless the filament form a closed path , it must extend either to infinity or to the boundary of the fluid . associate with a vortex filament be a velocity

field that the filament generate . this velocity be commonly refer to as the induce velocity . the induce velocity can be calculate from the biot-savart law [ @card@ ] as

and strength y , and r be the position vector from the point at which the induce velocity be be calculate to the element of the vortex . @card@ vortex theory of propeller the vortex theory of propeller be base on the concept that each element of the blade can be treat as a two-dimensional airfoil section

@card@

subject to a certain local resultant velocity wand that the local lift of the blade element , dl , be associate with the circulation r around the contour of the airfoil . the local resultant velocity be find from the

vector sum of the free stream velocity , the circumferential velocity of the section and the induce flow velocity . the kutta-joukowski theorem [ @card@ ] , for each blade element , may be write dl = prwdr where p be the local density of the air and Dr be the elemental blade length . in general , the circulation r around a blade will vary along the Dr blade span . as the circulation change by the amount -- - Dr between the Dr paint rand r + Dr along the blade length , it follow , from the vortex
( @card@ )

continuity principle , that a trail vortex filament of the same strength emanate from the blade element and extend infinitely far downstream of the blade . because trail vortex emanate from every point along the rotate

blade , they form a vortex sheet of approximately helical shape . the number of such sheet be equal to the number of blade . due to the trail vortex sheet there be an induce velocity distribution , wi , in the plane of rotor . this induce velocity can be use to obtain the local resultant velocity w that may in turn be use in the kutta-joukowski theorem to determine the lift on a blade element .
@card@

general assumption the principle assumption on which the present analysis of the

aerodynamic performance of a horizontal axis wind turbine be base may be state as follow : 1 ) that the air flow be incompressible and inviscid ,

@card@ @card@ ) that the free stream velocity be always parallel to the rotor shaft centerline and uniform along the span , @card@ ) that the relative velocity of a blade element to the airstream be identical to the velocity that the blade element would have be it place in a two-dimensional stream with an identical relative velocity , @card@ ) that the trail vortex system be helicoidal with constant pitch and diameter , extend infinitely far downstream of the blade , and move with a constant velocity determine at the rotor ( semi-rigid wake ) , and 5 ) that the hub have no effect on the rotor flow . unlike other vortex theory e.g. . , goldstein [ @card@ ] and theodorson [ @card@ ] theory , the present method of analysis , which will be term the helical vortex method , do not restrict the circulation along the blade to that of an optimum distribution corresponding to a rigid helical vortex system move backward from the blade with constant velocity . however , like other vortex

method , the current method do assume that slipstream expansion be of secondary importance and thus may be neglect . slipstream expansion be due

to the gradual decrease of axial velocity behind the rotor which be cause by the decrease in pressure behind the rotor . the decrease in air pressure

behind a wind turbine and the increase in air pressure immediately in front of rotor be a direct reaction of the axial force on the wind turbine . it

should be note that the first , second and third assumption in the preceding list of assumption be identical to those use in goldstein and theoderson theory . further , no hub be permissible in either of these theory ; all

integration must begin at the origin and not at the hub radius .

@card@ @card@ double-bladed , naca @card@ airfoil wind turbine calculation in this section , the power output of a double-bladed rotor wind turbine will be present for four pitch angle and two different rotational speed . the blade profile use in all calculation be an naca @card@ airfoil . this

particular blade section be choose because it be the blade section use in the early nasa , large , wind turbine . display in table i . pertinent blade information be

the dimension of the blade be give in fig . @card@ ,

and the aerodynamic blade datum , i.e. . , the lift and drag coefficient curve , be show in fig . @card@ and @card@ . these curve be take from [ @card@ ] .

further , because portion of the wind turbine blade may operate in the ` ` stalled region , ' ' which occur at blade angle of attack approximately @card@ ° and large , the airfoil datum have to be supplement with additional information . this high angle of attack information be take from [ @card@ ] . it will be show

later in this section that good understanding of this operate region be urgently need if improvement in performance prediction be to be realize . it should also be mention that surface roughness have be account for in fig . @card@ and @card@ , and that the curve correspond to a ` ` haif rough ' ' ( average between rough and smooth curve ) value . the reynolds number be that calculate at the mid span of the blade , hence , no account of the reynolds number variation along the blade be include . subsequent evaluation can ,

however , easily account for both blade surface roughness and reynolds number effect simply by include this datum as part of the computer input . at the

present time , these effect be consider secondary and therefore no effort be expend to implement them in the computer program . circulation distribution along the blade must first be determine in order to calculate wind turbine performance . this involve evaluation of the

assume series for the circulation as describe in the previous section .

@card@ a sample of the variation of this parameter against non-dimensional radius be plot in fig . @card@ for the operate condition specify . figure @card@ be construct in order to compare predict wind turbine power output to exist experimental datum . the experimental datum be take predict power

from nasa mod-o test result describe in [ 4j , [ 5j and [ 12j .

output value be compute for a blade fix at a pitch angle of @card@ ° . experimental output datum be obtain for a blade pitch angle of @card@ ° for wind speed below @card@ mph ; at wind speed large than @card@ mph , the blade be pitch in order to maintain the rate power level of the machine . it should be mention that the power output in fig . @card@ be not rotor power . instead , an empirical relation , take from [ 5j , relate the rotor this relationship account for

power to the alternator power have be use .

the loss in the power transmission ( gear , friction , etc . ) and , of course , be not applicable to all wind turbine installation . the relation be give by where pg pr pg = @card@ ( pr - 0.075pe ) ( @card@ )

= generate

electrical power , kw

= power produce by the rotor , kw pe = rate electrical power , kw
from fig . @card@ , it can bee see that in general there be excellent agreement between predict and mean value of output power . furthermore , the

present method predict a ` ` cut-in ' ' wind speed of @card@ mph which agree very well with the actual value report in [ 4j . figure @card@ be draw so as to compare predict alternator power value of the present method to corresponding value find by use the prop computer code . as may be see , four model of the prop code have be use : the

prandtl model , the goldstein model , the no-tip-loss model and the nasa model . the theoretical background for both the prandtl and goldstein model be

briefly treat in appendix a ; the no-tip-loss model be self descriptive as it do not account for any blade end effect ; the nasa model exploit the simplicity of the no-tip-loss model by accounting for blade end effect solely by a reduction ( @card@ . ) of the blade radius -- this method be also call the effective radius model . reference to fig . @card@ show that result determine by the present method be anywhere from @card@ to @card@ % high than those predict by the prop code for wind speed range from @card@ to @card@ mph . these result when combine with those of fig . @card@ reveal that prop code method underestimate the power output of wind turbine in the wind speed range of interest : ` ` cut-in ' ' to rate .

comparison of prop prediction with experimental datum be also perform in [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . it be find that the prop code method underpredicted power clearly , these finding be

output and overpredicted ` ` cut-in ' ' wind speed . in total agreement with the current finding .

when exist experimental datum for blade pitch angle other than @card@ ° be compare to predict result from both current and prop model , it be find that agreement be not as good as that display in fig . @card@ . at present ,

question have be raise as to the reliability of the experimental datum [ @card@ ] . thus , those comparison will not be show . however , it be believe

that comparison between prop prediction and cury'ent method calculation for different blade pitch angle may be of some value . this comparison be

present in the form of table ii , iii and iv where compute power output in kw be show against wind speed for the five method of prediction at blade angle of _1 ° , +1 ° and +3 ° respectively . it must also be note that the power

value present aloe rotor power value i.e. . , they have not be correct by use equation ( @card@ ) . moreover , the datum be present in tabular form

because of the difficulty in graph result that be relatively close together over various portion of the wind spectrum .

between pitch angle setting .

effective angle of attack , ne , occur for negatively pitch wind turbine blade and that the small q occur at positive pitch angle . to obtain an e idea as to how the effective angle of attack be distribute along the blade , as calculate by the present method , qe be plot for five location along the blade ( @card@ / @card@ span , @card@ / @card@ span , @card@ / @card@ span , @card@ / @card@ span and @card@ / @card@ span ) against wind velocity in fig . @card@ to @card@ . pitch angle . each figure correspond to a particular blade

reference to the four ' figure reveal that at any blade

location , q increase as the wind velocity increase and that the increase be e practically linear . moreover , it can be see by comparison that at a give blade location and wind speed , qe decrease as the pitch angle be change from _1 ° to +3 ° . thus , blade with negative pitch angle be ` ` stalled ' ' at low wind velocity than be positively pitch blade . unfortunately the nature of this stall condition on rotate blade be not well understand at present . in particular , the effect of the centrifugal

force on the boundary layer near the tip of the blade may , in fact , delay the presence of stall . it should be note that the stall condition could be

avoid , in the operate wind speed range of the wind turbine , by appropriately twist the blade along its span . blade twist angle may be find by

depict in fig . @card@ .

it be believe that for very large wind turbine the

use of a single blade reduce capital cost without much reduction in aerodynamic efficiency . to test this premise , the computer program be use to compute the aerodynamic performance of a particular one-bladed machine . in the analysis ,

the counterweight be take to be @card@ lbs and locate at a radial position @card@ foot from the turbine rotational axis . support spar be show in fig . @card@ . the counterweight and cylindrical

calculation of counterweight effect on

the performance be base on the assumption that there be no circulation around the counterweight or support spar and that the drag coefficient for these part be @card@ and @card@ respectively . performance of a one-bladed and a two-bladed rotor be compare in fig . @card@ and @card@ . maximum power . it can be see that at @card@ mph both machine produce their however , the one-bladed machine produce less than half as furthermore , fig . @card@ reveal that clearly , rotor power of a

much power as the two-bladed machine .

the two-bladed machine be also more efficient .

one-bladed rotor can be increase , as show in fig . @card@ , by operate at high rotational velocity . this , of course , would be accomplish at the cost of high start-up or ` ` cut-in ' ' speed . inspection of fig . @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ reveal that they be not sufficient to decide whether a single-bladed rotor wind turbine be practical or not . the feasibility of this concept strongly depend on the local annual with such wind statistical datum , local annual power it should be mention that

wind distribution .

output of a one-bladed rotor could be estimate .

the same annual power of a two-bladed wind turbine may be obtain for a one-bladed turbine if diameter of this turbine be appropriately increase .

conclusion in this report , a method for the prediction of wind turbine performance

have be develop .

the equation present be fairly general :

applicable

to any blade geometry or any airfoil section .

although calculation be

present for only one and two bladed rotor , the method be applicable to wind turbine have any number of blade . the current method have be programme on a high speed , digital computer to permit extensive analysis . two-dimensional airfoil datum be use as input to the program . this input datum can be extend to include variation in reynolds number and blade surface roughness , and therefore , can enable the computer program to well predict the performance of a blade element . further refinement of the computer method may be require to take into account an expand wake and a non-uniform wind velocity . moreover , a more

suitable function for represent the circulation distribution than that use in this investigation may be warrant . the disadvantage of the fourier

series expansion that be use be that the compute time increase sharply as the number of term increase . unfortunately , extensive comparison of

predict wind turbine performance be not possible because of the unavailability of accurate datum . such a comparison will be make in the

future , as soon as the datum be available , and the result will be report in volume iii of this report . it be predict that large loss occur for a one-bladed wind turbine . and , that the peak power of a two-bladed rotor be approximately @card@ % high than that of one-bladed rotor operate at a particular rotational speed . however , by increase the diameter , the same peak power of a two-bladed turbine may be obtain for a one-bladed turbine and may still be economically competitive with a turbine have more blade .

review of various

of wind turbine

aerodynamic : .- ' ~ erformance

calculatior . ! .

the purpose of this appendix be to briefly present some of the theoretical background for a variety of the method that have be use to predict the aerodynamic performance of horizontal axis wind turbine . should be mention that this review be not comprehensive , for such an undertaking would far exceed the practical limit of this work . the method which will be describe herein be : momentum theory , blade element theory , it

glauert vortex theory , prandtl theory and goldstein theory .

i .

momentum theory in the original , so-called , momentum theory develop by Rankine [ @card@ ]

and froude [ @card@ ] , momentum and energy principle be apply to a simplify model that be base on the follow three assumption : 1 ) the thrust loading be uniformly distribute over the propeller disk ( this imply that there be an infinite number of blade in the disk ) . 2 ) no rotation be impart to the flow . 3 ) a well-defined slipstream separate the flow pass through the propeller disk from that outside the disk . the momentum theorem be apply to the control volume show in fig . a-i and it be find that
( a-l )

in this equation , f be the axial force on the wind turbine , m be the flow rate , Vo be the free ream velocity and the v2 be downstream velocity . also , density , area and velocity at the rotor disk be denote by respectively .

the flow field and control volume for momentum theory

@card@

if bp be the discontinuous decrease in the static pressure across the rotor disk , then the axial force on rotor may be express as f = abp an expression for bp can be obtain by apply bernoulli ' s equation in front of and behind the rotor disk
po + -- - pv

@card@ = p + -- - pu2 @card@

subtraction and rearrangement bring bp = @card@ p ( v - v ) @card@

therefore , the axial force on the wind turbine be f

= abp = -

pa ( v - v ) @card@

unite this equation with equation ( a-i ) result in

( a-2 )
thus , the velocity of flow through the disk be the arithmetic average of the upstream and downstream velocity . an axial interference factor , a , be define as the fractional change in the free ream velocity that occur ahead of the disk , i.e. . ,
a

=

hence , the velocity of flow through the disk may be write
( a-3 )

@card@ equating equation ( a-2 ) and ( a-3 ) and rearrange reveal that
a
=

vo - v2 2vo

@card@ @card@

v2 2vo

( a-4 )

and it may be see that when the rotor absorb all the energy of the flow ( v2 = @card@ ) , the interference factor will have a value of @card@ / @card@ . the power absorb by the rotor be equal to the mass flow rate time the change in kinetic energy of the incoming fluid , i.e. . ,

combine equation ( a-2 ) , ( a-4 ) and ( a-5 ) , yield p

= 2pav a ( l - a ) @card@

@card@ o

( a-6 )

it can be see that for a give wind speed , rotor size and air density , the power absorb depend only on the interference factor . hence , maximum power dp be produce when -- - = o . it be easy to show that this condition occur for da an axial interference value of
@card@ @card@ .

thus , from ( a-6 )

( a-7 )

and a power coefficient , define as

have a maximum value of @card@ . if the rotation impart to flo\ ' / be include , in the analysis , the total reduction in translational kinetic energy of the flow be 6k.e .

= power

extract + rotation k.e. .

@card@

therefore , in order to obtain the maximum power from the stream , it be necessary to keep the rotational kinetic energy as small as possible . moreover , the element of torque be equal to the angular momentum impart to the blade element in unit time . this equation for a blade element at radial distance r , if ow be the rotational velocity of the air , can be write as dq = 2nr3puowdr an angular interference factor be define as ( a-io ) where ( a-g )

° be the rotational
dq

velocity of the blade .

introduce equation

( a-io ) into equation ( a-g ) yield

= 4n 3pu a'odr

( a-ii )

use this equation along with the previous theory , allow the incremental axial force , torque and power to be write respectively as df

( a-14 ) it should be mention that momentum theory provide a good indication of the power coefficient , but fail to furnish the require design datum for the rotor blade except for the limit case of an infinite number of blade .

@card@

ii .

blade element theory an alternate method of analyze the behavior of a blade consist

of directly estimate the force experience by the blade due to the motion of the air . this method , generally refer to as blade element theory [ 9j ,

be base on the assumption that the aerodynamic force act on the blade element can be estimate as the force on a suitable airfoil of the same cross-section in an airflow with a uniform velocity wat the same angle of attack . and , that the force on the entire blade can be derive by sum from the velocity and

the contribution of all the element along the blade .

force diagram for a blade element show in fig . a-2 , it can be see that tan4 > where

in addition , the incremental axial force and torque be

@card@

if the section lift and drag coefficient be know , the axial force and torque can be determine by integrate equation ( a-16 ) and ( a-17 ) along the blade . it should be mention that the blade characteristic be those of an

airfoil of the same cross-section in a two-dimensional airflow . the unsatisfactory feature of blade element theory be that it rely on certain airfoil characteristic which vary with aspect ratio and which depend on the interference between the adjacent blade of a rotor . further , this

theory use airfoil datum corresponding to a moderate blade aspect ratio , have be find to properly represent observed behavior of a propeller , but fail to provide accurate numerical result [ @card@ ] . to improve the accuracy of blade

element theory it have be suggest , [ @card@ ] , that the resultant velocity of the blade should be estimate in term of modified velocity such as those that be determine by the momentum theory . the combined momentum-blade element theory equation be similar to those of the glauert vortex theory , [ @card@ ] which will be discuss in the follow section .

iii .

glauert vortex theory glauert vortex theory be base on the assumption that trail

vortex emanate from the trail edge of rotate blade and form helical vortex sheet that pass downstream . the interference velocity experience by

the blade be calculate as the induce velocity of this vortex system on any blade element . the calculation of these induce velocity be simplify by assume that the rotor have an infinite number of blade .

in order to solve equation ( a-2i ) and ( a-22 ) , must first be determine .

and the interference factor

as an aid to this process , it may be assume that

there be an infinite number of blade , thus , momentum theory equation can be directly apply . in addition , if the rotation in the slipstream be neglect

the follow relationship be obtain from ( a-12 ) , ( a-21 ) and ( a-23 )

moreover , equating ( a-13 ) with the element of torque obtain by combine ( a-22 ) and ( a-24 ) , it be easy to show that

- = -- -- -- @card@ - at @card@ sincp coscp
since the momentum theory equation have be employ . an approximate

( a-27 )

these equation strictly apply to a rotor with a large number of blade

method of correct equation ( a-26 ) and ( a-27 ) to account for a rotor with a small number of blade be analogous to that use by prandt1 [ @card@ ] . accord to that method , the distribution of vortex strength over the blade be relate to the shape and motion of the airscrew . the relation of the distribution of vortex strength to the velocity field produce by it have be determine by Goldstein [ @card@ ] for optimum loading . it should also be mention

that the glauert vortex theory do not account for the loss of lift toward the tip of the blade . however , for this theory the concept of an effective

radius may be use to account for this loss .

iv .

prandt1 theory for the optimum circulation condition , the vortex sheet be assume

to be a rigid helical surface move backward with constant velocity [ @card@ ] . near the boundary of the surface there be flow around the edge of the vortex sheet and thus , the flow acquire an important radial component of velocity . prandt1 approximate the effect of this radial flow by replace the helical vortex system , show in fig . a-4 , with a series of parallel line at a

thus , f ' be a reduction factor which must be apply to the momentum equation for the flow at radius r , since it represent the fact that only a fraction , f ' , of the fluid between successive sheet of the slipstream receive the full effect of these sheet [ @card@ ] . apply this correction to the earlier

apply to the case of an ideal airscrew have a finite number of blade and a particular distribution of circulation along the blade for small value of thrust . goldstein [ @card@ ] specifically consider Betz ' s optimum condition the essential result of Goldstein ' S

wind energy
a guide for wind site development
wind power development
put wind to work have be a goal of civilization down through the age . wind be a free , renewable fuel that have be use to power ship , grind grain , and pump water . technical improvement over the past decade have increase the size and power output capacity of wind turbine , significantly reduce the cost of use wind to generate electricity . federal and state funded research , development , and other financial incentive , such a payment tie to production and tax benefit , have spur wind project development in recent year . the new york state energy research and development authority ( nyserda ) have fund major project to map new york ' s wind and encourage the development of wind power across the state . with assistance from nyserda , several large-scale wind farm have be develop in new york state and several other project be at various stage of development .

what be wind energy and how do it work ?
wind be create when the sun unevenly heat the earth ' S surface . wind turbine capture the wind in their blade ( or rotor ) and then convert the wind energy to rotational or mechanical energy . the rotor drive an attach shaft and a gearbox and generator to produce electrical energy . together , the gearbox and generator be call the drive train . the electricity generate by the wind turbine be meter and then deliver to the electric transmission grid for consumption . the wind turbine include a tower that support the rotor , drive train , and other equipment such as the control , electrical
continue

cable , and interconnection hardware . each turbine be control by a computer . in large project with multiple wind turbine , each turbine computer be connect to a central computer where plant operator can remotely monitor the turbine . each turbine have a wind vane that send a signal to the computer , which then turn the turbine directly into the wind . wind turbine be design with a cut-in speed , or wind speed , at which it begin to produce power , and a cut-out speed , or the wind speed at which the turbine will be shut down to prevent the drive train from be damage . cut-in speed be typically seven to nine mph . maximum electric gener-ation occur at speed of @card@ mile per hour ( mph ) . as wind speed increase beyond @card@ mph , the generator maintain its maximum electrical generation until wind speed reach @card@ mph and the turbine cuts-out . when the cut-out wind speed be reach , the turbine automatically stop production and be revolve from the wind to protect the drive train from mechanical damage . as high wind subside , the computer automatically revolve the turbine back into the wind and the unit return to operation . output from a wind turbine , or a wind energy plant , be always change because the wind be never constant . over the course of a year , wind power plant typically operate at an average of @card@ percent of their rate capacity . output depend on factor such as average wind speed , the design of the turbine ( i.e. . , blade shape ) , and operate characteristic such as cutout speed , reliability , and the efficiency of the drive train . a @card@ megawatt ( mw ) wind power plant in new york state will produce @card@ mw and could produce the same amount of electricity that be use by approximately @card@ , @card@ household .

what be the step associate with develop and construct a wind energy project ? the essential step be : locate a region that offer good wind resource potential , appropriate amount of land with open and accessible acreage , interested community and landowner , access to transmission line , and no obvious environmental concern . assess wind characteristic at specific location and acquire landowner approval to install a meteorological tower ( about @card@ foot tall ) to collect wind datum for a year or long . develop a project layout and conduct meeting with local government and landowner to secure access , permit , and approval . perform environmental evaluation to ensure the project pose no significant environmental impact . negotiate power sale contract ( S ) with financially stable energy purchaser . evaluate and purchase wind turbine and finalize installation contract . begin construction - construction require six to nine month once a notice to proceed be grant . test and evaluate function of the complete plant to ensure proper operation . this entire process take about two to three year depend on local condition .

what make a good wind site ? do i have a good wind site ?
sustained wind speed be critical to a project ' s economic viability . wind turbine require a minimum annual average wind speed above @card@ mph , or @card@ meter per second . the proximity of turbine to electric transmission line be another important factor in evaluate the economic viability of a project . due to the high cost associate with build transmission line , most wind project be locate within three mile of high-voltage transmission line . also , land feature ( hill and ravine ) , vegetation , and nearby structure can affect how valuable a site be for wind energy development . in new york , high hilltop , relatively free of tree and building , be favorable for a wind energy project . factor such as the accessibility of the land for construction , soil type , and terrain impact construction as well as maintenance need and cost . environmental impact relate to view-sheds , noise , bird , wetland , and historical preservation be crucial to the viability of a project and its community acceptance .

how much land be require ?
large wind project require @card@ acre of land per turbine to provide adequate exposure to the wind , proper setback from home and roadway , and appropriate spacing between turbine . terrain feature also need to be consider . space be need around a turbine for a 20-foot , gravel access road , a 10x12 foot concrete pad for an electrical transformer , and the turbine foundation . excavate requirement and the type of foundation need for each turbine will depend on turbine size , soil condition , and method employ . foundation be concrete and can be a bury slab with a support column or

how big be wind project in comparison to local power plant ?
a bury cylinder . bury slab foundation be @card@ foot in diameter . bury cylinder foundation be about @card@ foot in diameter . excavation for both foundation type be approximately @card@ foot in diameter . power cable between turbine be bury at least three foot below the surface to accommodate farming need . a project usually include a substation where power be transform to be compatible with the high-voltage transmission system or grid .
local power plant
robert moses niagara power plant - niagara fall , niagara county : @card@ mw somerset coal plant , niagara county : @card@ mw fitzpatrick nuclear power plant , oswego county : @card@ mw

what be the visual impact on the landscape ?
wind energy project alter the visual landscape of an area or region . wind turbine will most likely be the large structure in the landscape and the blade attract attention because they rotate . surround terrain feature can also influence the look of a wind energy project . since wind turbine be commonly locate on the high area in a region , the surround terrain can often block the view of the turbine from different view point . project view will vary in different season and even during different time of the day . to meet federal aviation administration requirement , turbine must be illuminate at night with red or clear strobe light . view-shed analysis and computer-aided visualization of potential project layout provide community with realistic example of how a project will look from different perspective . it be common to modify propose turbine location to enhance the visual appeal of a project , assume it do not adversely impact the energy output from the project .

can i hear the turbine ?
noise issue be associate with some early wind project , however , noise have be reduce through advance in system design and the appropriate use of setback from residence . typical noise level from turbine , at the base of a tower , be @card@ decibel ( db ) , or the same level of noise you would routinely hear inside a home or office . noise level drop to about @card@ db at onequarter of a mile ( @card@ , @card@ foot ) from the turbine . at this distance , the turbine be barely discernible above normal conversation and their noise be typically mute by the naturally occur noise at a site . if turbine be site @card@ , @card@ foot or more from residence , noise concern be usually mitigate .

how big be today ' s commercial turbine ?
wind energy project be be build with turbine range in size from @card@ kw to @card@ kw ( @card@ , 000kw = 1mw ) . example of turbine be :
vesta v-47 - @card@ kw wind turbine rotor diameter : @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) blade length : @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) tower height : @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) total height ( tower and blade ) : @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) ge wind energy - @card@ mw wind turbine rotor diameter : @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) blade length : @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) tower height : @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) total height ( tower and blade ) : @card@ ft ( @card@ m )

how much revenue do turbine provide ?
payment to landowner be commonly structure in a land lease , but developer may purchase the land or seek wind easement . in a land lease , the developer obtain exclusive access to the land for wind energy-related requirement , for a period of @card@ year . in return , land-owners be pay in a lump sum , or through annual royalty payment base on the amount of energy produce by the turbine install on the land , and can continue to use most of the land for routine activity such as farming . annual payment depend on a variety of factor and can range from $ @card@ to $ @card@ , @card@ per mw . wind easement be often use by developer to ensure that vital land and associated air space be keep available for transmission access , additional turbine installation , or to ensure adequate exposure to the wind . wind easement be normally negotiate in perpetuity and developer be usually compensate with a one-time , up-front payment .

today ' S turbine be tall than niagara fall and about the height of the statue of liberty .

what be the benefit of wind energy ?
wind energy be inexhaustible and non-pollute . it be also compatible with mixed land use such as grazing or agriculture . wind energy project be modular and the development and construction process be relatively fast when compare to bring a new coal or nuclear plant on line . wind output price
continue

large wind turbine - commercial application

be not susceptible to price fluctuation like petroleumbased fuel , although the sale of the wind plant output must compete in the marketplace against compete fuel .

additional rural benefit include :
economic diversification - wind energy provide farming community with a new source of long-term revenue without a significant impact to exist agricultural operation . new job for wind turbine construction , operation , and maintenance be create , some material and supply can be purchase locally , and landowner will benefit from payment from developer . increase tax base - wind project make payment to local tax authority ( school district , town , county , or state government ) that broaden the local tax base and provide new local revenue , with the potential to reduce tax burden on local resident .

potential , the developer will install monitor equipment , pursue power purchase contract , and initiate other development activity at no cost to the landowner . the risk to a landowner in a land lease be relatively low , since the landowner do not have a financial position in the project . another landowner strategy be to pursue some level of development activity independently , or in a partnership with other . this approach may be more risky , require significantly more time and financial investment , and only make sense in area with a strong market for wind energy . in this strategy , an experienced consultant be hire to collect wind resource measurement on the affected land . the landowner be responsible for the cost of data collection , with the risk that the wind resource be insufficient to attract development . if the a good wind resource exist , a landowner can begin additional development activity or negotiation with developer for land lease or other agreement from a strong position of know the wind resource , base on an independent analysis . 3 ) make contact - use list of developer and consultant from source such as the American wind energy association ( replaced-dns ) , and contact industry member to make them aware of local interest . as discuss above , there be a number of factor that help determine if a site be suitable for a wind energy project , so be prepare to answer question such as : • how many acre do you own ? what be the current land use ? • be there limitation for construction or operation ? what be neighbor land use ? • what be the elevation of your land ? how do it compare to the surround area ? be your land the high , or be it otherwise well expose to prevailing wind ? • how close be you to the near high-voltage transmission line ? do it cross your property ? who own the line ? what be the voltage of the line ? wind project usually require @card@ kv transmission line , @card@ kv service may add additional development cost to the project . 4 ) assess community interest - discuss a potential wind project with neighbor , local government official , and business interest to determine opinion about wind energy development in the area . work with local authority to develop an approach to attract wind-energy developer to your area that balance community value and need .

i think i have land that can be develop for wind - what should i do next ?
1 ) educate yourself - first , see how expert have characterize new york state ' s wind pattern in the wind energy map find at : http : / / replaced-dns . this map will help you learn more about the estimated wind speed at your site . then , visit site such as replaced-dns to learn more about the development process , wind technology , the major stakeholder in the wind industry , and landowner experience . consider the long-term desirability for host a wind turbine or participate in a wind energy project , weigh all the risk and reward associate with such project . consult with a attorney regard landowner right and responsibility . 2 ) consider various development strategy as mention above- the most common agreement available to a landowner be a land lease with a developer in return for a lump sum payment , or annual payment , or perhaps some combination of the two . developer often start by sign a land-lease option and then collect wind datum ( data be typically collect for one year ) before sign a long-term lease . it be important to note that a land lease with a developer do not guarantee that a project will be build on your land . a developer must have both the financial mean to build the project and the ability to sell the project ' s output over the long-term to make the project economically viable . if it look like the site have

' ' for small wind turbine , the problem of ice prevention be even more severe due to the high ice collection efficiency and small potential power output when compare with a large turbine . for more severe icing event , stop the turbine may be the most logical solution due to the energy require for ice prevention and wear on the machine . stop a wind turbine during the presence of every icing condition , however , would be non-productive . for slight to moderate icing event , where the turbine continue to operate but at reduce level of efficiency , it may be beneficial to continue operation with , or perhaps , without anti-icing device in place . the determination of the good option to maximize energy output from the turbine operate in an icing environment require a knowledge of the performance loss that can be expect during the icing event . there have already be several investigation of airfoil operate in ice condition as relate to aircraft . these study , however , have mainly focus on a range of angle of attack up to sta : ' for airfoil with ice accretion base on aircraft flight condition . expanded angle of attack range through stall be necessary to properly predict wind turbine performance . furthermore , blade leading-edge ice shape base on meteorological condition prevalent during wind turbine icing event must be generate for good correlation of airfoil performance experimental datum to full-scale wind turbine .

horn , the corresponding coefficient would be reduce by @card@ % and @card@ % for case r2 and r4 , respectively . the two most obvious feature of the polars be the large loss in lift and the increase in drag as the degree of ice increase . it be particularly noticeable that the low drag for the icing case correspond to the angle of attack use to generate the ice profile , that be a = @card@ deg - a result that be typical of other test on iced airfoil . above and below this angle of attack , significant flow separation occur on the upper and low surface , respectively . the result be an increase in drag above and below the @card@ deg angle of attack . the sharp rise in drag above @card@ deg be cause by the rapid growth of upper surface separation , which be also reflect in the change in the lift curve slope .

several other interesting feature can be identify . firstly , fig . @card@ illustrate important reynolds number effect . as expect , the drag be reduce with increase reynolds number for the clean case . for the icing case , however , the reynolds number effect be minimal because transition to turbulent flow be promote artificially by the grit roughness - a process that be know to be rather insensitive to reynolds number for large roughness . secondly , the rather dramatic increase in citmax and stall delay for ice profile r4 as compare with the clean case and the other icing case be surprising . it be , however , similar to the effect produce by leading-edge flaps.19'20 thirdly , as the icing become more extreme , the separation pocket on the low surface at zero lift grow , thereby produce a

slight increase in the zero-lift angle of attack . finally , the pitch moment curve change rather dramatically as compare with the clean case . this trend be most easily explain by consider the r4 case . as the angle of attack be increase , the pitch moment become more positive , which be indicative of a center of pressure
that move forward . this movement be attributable to

the large upper-surface leading-edge suction peak , which become more extreme with increase angle of attack . additional test be perform to determine the effect of roughness on the ice shape . the result show in fig . @card@ for case rl at re = i x @card@ and @card@ x @card@ be quite typical of the other case . when the roughness be reduce from k / c = @card@ to @card@ , there be a small drag reduction . when no roughness be use , however , drag be substantially reduce and the low drag range be extend to both high and low lift coefficient . these change result from less separated flow as can be deduce from the increase in lift over the entire positive lift range . clearly , these result underscore the importance of simulate the roughness of the rime ice .

figure 7a show the predict performance for the stall-regulated rotor for the clean case and for rime ice case r2 and r4 with k / c = @card@ . corresponding datum be show in fig . 7b for the variable-speed rotor . it be know that for the variable-speed rotor in operation at constant tip speed ratio , the ( ^-distribution along the blade span remain the same for wind speed below that for rate power . thus , the percentage loss in performance due to icing be nearly constant at all wind speed - @card@ % for rime ice profile r2 and @card@ % for r4 . for the stall-regulated rotor , the lift coefficient along the blade span change with wind speed , and this lead to substantially different effect as compare with the variable-speed case . for wind speed above approximately @card@ m / S , the power curve be dictate largely by the airfoil characteristic in the vicinity of stall . in particular , a high cltmax produce a high peak rotor power . for rime ice profile r2 , the ci > max be below that for the clean airfoil ( see fig . 4 ) . consequently , the power curve fall below that for the clean case . both the loss

acknowledgment
the support of the national renewable energy laboratory under subcontract xaf-4-14076-03 be gratefully acknowledge . also , the several discussion with
j.l. . tangy of nrel prove to be quite helpful during

increase in giimax and a delay in stall to a high angle of attack . these change in the airfoil performance lead to a @card@ % increase in the peak rotor power - an undesirable result that can lead to generator burn-out and high blade load . finally , these estimate be conservative since the ice accretion study here do not attempt to model the extreme icing event sometimes observe on real rotor under more prolonged rime ice condition .

wind turbine technology

bwea brieﬁng sheet wind turbine technology

since early time , man have harness the power of the wind , with the ﬁrst mill record as long ago as the 6th century ad . the technology have diversiﬁed over the year to include pump water , grind grain , power sawmill and most recently generate electricity , now the fast grow energy sector worldwide . wind turbine technology have develop rapidly in recent year and europe be at the hub of this hightech industry . wind turbine be become more powerful , with the late turbine model have large blade length which can utilise more wind and therefore produce more electricity , bring down the cost of renewable energy generation . the ﬁrst commercial wind farm in the uk , build in @card@ at delabole in growth in size of commercial wind turbine design © ewea Cornwall , use @card@ kilowatt ( kw ) turbine , while the late trial have involve turbine ten time more powerful , of four megawatt ( mw ) and above . the average size of an onshore wind turbine install in @card@ be approximately @card@ mw . wind turbine have an average work life of @card@ year , after which the turbine can be replace with new one or decommission . old turbine can be sell in the second hand market and they also have a scrap value which can be use for any ground restoration work .

how do a wind turbine work ?
wind turbine produce electricity by use the natural power of the wind to drive a generator . the wind be a clean and sustainable fuel source , it do not create emission and it will never run out as it be constantly replenish by energy from the sun . in many way , wind turbine be the natural evolution of traditional windmill , but now typically have three blade , which rotate around a horizontal hub at the top of a steel tower . most wind turbine start generate electricity at wind speed of around @card@ metre per second ( m / S ) , ( @card@ mile per hour ) ; generate maximum " rate ' power at around @card@ m / s ( 30mph ) ; and shut down to prevent storm damage at @card@ m / s or above ( 50mph ) . wind turbine technology generate electricity from the wind be simple : wind pass over the blade exert a turn force . the turbine rotate blade turn a shaft inside the nacelle , which go into a gearbox . the gearbox increase the rotation speed for the generator , which use magnetic ﬁelds to convert the rotational energy into
component of a typical wind

electrical energy . the power output go to a transformer , which convert the electricity from the generator at around @card@ volt ( v ) to the right voltage for the distribution system , typically between @card@ kv and @card@ kv . the regional electricity distribution network or national grid transmit the electricity around the country , and on into home and business .

offshore technology
offshore wind farm be an exciting new area for the industry , largely due to the fact that there be high wind speed available offshore and economy of scale allow for the installation of large size wind turbine offshore . offshore wind turbine technology be base on the same principle as onshore technology . foundation be construct to hold the superstructure , of which there be a number of design , but the most common be a driven pile . the top of the foundation be paint a bright colour to make it visible to ship and have an access platform to allow maintenance team to dock . subsea cable take the power to a transformer , ( which can be either offshore or onshore ) which convert the electricity to a high voltage ( normally between @card@ kv and @card@ kv ) before connect to the grid at a substation on land .

operation and maintenance
both onshore and offshore wind turbine have instrument on top of the nacelle , an anemometer and a wind vane , which respectively measure wind speed and direction . when the wind change direction , motor turn the nacelle , and the blade along with it , around to face into the wind . the blade also " pitch ' or angle to ensure that the optimum amount of power be extract from the wind . all this information be record by computer and transmit to a control centre , which can be many mile away . wind turbine be not physically staff , although each will have

replaced-dns

periodic mechanical check , often carry out by local ﬁrms . the onboard computer also monitor the performance of each turbine component , and will automatically shut the turbine down if any problem be detect , alert an engineer that an onsite visit be require . the amount of electricity produce from a wind turbine depend on three factor : 1 ) wind speed the power available from the wind be a function of the cube of the wind speed . therefore if the wind blow at twice the speed , its energy content will increase eight-fold . turbine at a site where the wind speed average @card@ m / s produce around @card@ % more electricity than those where the average wind speed be @card@ m / S . 2 ) wind turbine availability this be the capability to operate when the wind be blow , i.e. . when the wind turbine be not undergo maintenance . this be typically @card@ % or above for modern European machine . 3 ) the way wind turbine be arrange

wind farm be lay out so that one turbine do not take the wind away from another . however other factor such as environmental consideration , visibility and grid connection requirement often take precedence over the optimum wind capture layout .

stand-alone and grid-connected small wind turbine
small scale wind turbine can be use in domestic , community and small wind energy project and these can be either stand-alone or grid-connected system . standalone system be use to generate electricity for charge battery to run small electrical application , often in remote location where it be expensive or not physically possible to connect to a main power supply . such example include rural farm and island community , with typical application be water heat or pump , electric livestock fencing , lighting or any kind of small electronic system need to control or monitor remote equipment . with grid-connected turbine the output from the wind turbine be directly connect to the existing main electricity supply . this type of system can be use both for individual wind turbine and for wind farm export electricity to the electricity network . a grid-connected wind turbine can be a good proposition if your consumption of electricity be high .

can we rely on the wind ?
wind generation be often describe as intermittent , as the wind do not blow continuously . this be a misnomer as it imply an " all or nothing ' delivery of energy . an individual wind turbine will generate electricity for @card@ % of the time and its electricity output vary between zero and full output in accordance with the wind speed . however , the combined output of the uk ' s entire wind power portfolio show less variability , give the difference in wind speed over the country as a whole . whilst the amount of wind generation vary , it rarely ( if ever ) go completely to zero , nor to full output . in order to maintain security of supply , a second-bysecond balance between generation and demand must be achieve . an excess of generation cause the system frequency to rise whilst an excess of demand cause the system frequency to fall . the electricity system be design and operate in such a way as to cope with large and small ﬂuctuations in supply and demand . no wind turbine nacelle . picture supply by slp energy . © Charles Hodge power station be totally reliable photography , lowestoft and demand be also uncertain . therefore , the system operator establish reserve that provide a capability to achieve balance give the statistic of variation expect over different timescales . the variability of wind generation be but one component of the generation and demand variation that be consider when set reserve level . the gb system operator , national grid transco state in their seven year statement that " base on recent analysis of the incidence and variation of wind speed we have find that the expect intermittency of wind do not pose such a major problem for stability and we be conﬁdent that this can be adequately managed.4 "

summary
wind turbine technology have develop and mature over the year and this technology now form an increasingly important part of the uk ' s electricity industry . renewable energy be vital in our ﬁght against climate change and technology such as wind energy can help in build a sustainable electricity generation system for the future .

marine renewable energy research and development at Virginia tech ' s advanced research institute ( vt-ari )
the past ten year have see substantial progress in harness marine renewable energy resource , particularly offshore wind , wave , and tidal current . vt-ari researcher be study the feasibility of these technology in a variety of north American collaborative project , as well as investigate their potential contribution to Virginia ' s energy need .
offshore wind energy be the most commercially mature of the marine renewable energy

technology , with denmark , germany and the united kingdom be particularly active in its deployment . nearly thirty offshore wind project be under development in the uk , and these could supply more than @card@ % of that nation ' s annual electricity demand in the come decade .
the 60-megawatt north hoyle project off the coast of wale be typical of today ' s offshore wind farm . install in may @card@ , it consist of thirty vesta 2-mw turbine , each have a rotor diameter of @card@ meter . this project occupy an area of six square kilometer .

local fabrication and installation contract account for about $ @card@ per kilowatt of an offshore wind farm ' s capital cost . marine service contract amount to about one cent per kilowatt-hour . these represent large new business opportunity for the hampton road region . offshore aquaculture might also be incorporate into such project , improve the business case and provide add sustainable economic development potential for Virginia ' s coastal community .
to meet this @card@ % level of demand , @card@ , @card@ mw of wind turbine capacity would have to be install , occupy just over a quarter of Virginia ' s continental shelf area between @card@ and @card@ nautical mile offshore

use the same size and spacing of wind turbine as show in above photo , an ocean shelf area the size of Virginia beach could supply @card@ % of the state ' s annual electricity demand

the Virginia coastal energy research consortium
the Virginia coastal energy research consortium be establish by the Virginia general assembly in @ord@ the Virginia tech advance research institute be name as one of five founding member , along with old dominion university , the Virginia institute of marine science , norfolk state university , and james madison university . the consortium serve as an interdisciplinary research , study , and information resource for the state on coastal energy resource , include offshore wind , wave , marine biomass , and methane hydrate .

in addition to quantify the potential energy and economic benefit of offshore wind energy development in Virginia , vt-ari researcher also be identify opportunity for the state ' s innovative manufacturer to develop lower-cost fabrication material and method for marine renewable energy structure . the development of an offshore test bed for large wind turbine and integration of intermittent wind and wave power with other generation source in the state be other key area of vt-ari research for the Virginia coastal energy research consortium .
tidal current energy can be harness by underwater turbine drive by the ebb and flow of the tide . this innovation in tidal power avoid the environmental impact of dam a bay or estuary . vt-ari be collaborate with the electric power research institute ( epri ) , utility , and the appropriate state or provincial government agency to plan and develop demonstration project for tidal current turbine in the puget sound region and the bay of fundy . vt-ari also be do tidal and river current modeling study for verdant power .

turbine operate

this 35-kilowatt underwater turbine be develop by verdant power and assemble in charlottesville , Virginia . six of these turbine have be operate in a @card@ kw demonstration project in new york ' s east river ( picture at left ) since may @ord@ the @card@ m diameter rotor have three blade and be on the downstream end of the turbine nacelle , which yaw @card@ ° when the tide turn .

wave energy be less mature than offshore wind or tidal current energy , but an epri feasibility

study , in which vt-ari also participate , find that for many site in the unite state , wave power be likely to realize economy of mass production more quickly than wind power . vt-ari be now do a wave energy forecast feasibility study for bonneville power administration .
the pelamis wave energy device resemble a floating sea snake , absorb energy from relative angular motion at the joint between its section as wave travel along its length . the photo at left show one of three unit be assemble by the Uk company , ocean power delivery , Ltd. , for a pilot plant off the coast of portugal , which eventually will grow into a @card@ mw project . update @card@ June @ord@ for more information , please contact george hagerman ( hagerman @ replaced-dns )

abstract
this article describe the development of the Musgrove vertical axis wind turbine ( v wt ) a concept , the uk " carmarthen bay ' wind turbine test programme , and Uk government ' s wind power programme to @ord@ one of the most significant development in the story of British wind power occur during the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s , with the development of the Musgrove vertical axis wind turbine and its inclusion within the Uk government ' s wind turbine test programme . evolve from a supervisor ' s idea for an undergraduate project at read university , the Musgrove v wt be once see as an able competitor to the a horizontal axis wind system that be also be encourage at the time by both the Uk government and the central electricity generating board , the then nationalise electricity utility for england and wale . during the 1980s and 1990s the most developed musgrove v awt system , along with three other commercial turbine design be test at carmarthen bay , south wale as part of a national wind power test programme . from these developmental test , operational datum be collect and lesson learn , which be incorporate into subsequent wind power operation .

@ord@ introduction
it be say in the @card@ ' S that the uk have more wind power expert per unit of wind energy generate than any other country in the world ! despite the sarcasm of this remark , it be correct that the uk have produce continue interest in wind power , from the early patent by Blyth [ @card@ ] , through post second world-war development by expert such as Golding [ @card@ ] to the post @card@ lobbying of the British wind energy association , which be a key founding influence for the initiation of the European wind energy association . this article aim to tell the story of one aspect of Uk wind energy progress , namely the carmarthen bay test site in south wale . this site be establish by the large nationalise utility of the time , the central electricity generating board , for the development of commercial-scale wind turbine for grid-electricity supply . background for this require an understanding of the historical context and a summary of the Uk government ' s wind-energy policy and funding at the time . a further aim be to outline the background for the most noteworthy type of turbine test at carmarthen bay , namely the musgrove vertical axis turbine . other site in the Uk host the commercial development of wind turbine , the most noteworthy probably be the burgar hill site on the main island of orkney , to the north of mainland scotland . however , the carmarthen bay site be nearest to london .

the intention of the author be to " tell the story ' and point to the manner of development . it be not the intention to analyse the engineering feature of the machine , nor their performance . such information be mostly bury in report to the funding agency and in technical article . surprisingly few of the latter be in archive journal publication , however , more may be find in conference proceeding .

@ord@ initial stage before large-scale development
even though contemporary policy seem to be to buy Danish and german machine , the first industrial-scale electricity-generate wind turbine to be build in the uk be construct under the direction of the British electrical and allied industry research association ( more commonly know as the electrical research association , or simply the era ) during the 1950s and 1960s . three machine be construct , all of which be prototype 100kw horizontal axis machine , viz . [ @card@ , @card@ ] : 1 . 2 . @ord@ a variable pitch , 3-bladed , @card@ m diameter machine install by the glasgow shipbuilder , john brown ltd. , during @card@ on Orkney , Scotland . a de havilland propeller ltd. , @card@ m diameter 2-bladed enfield-andreau type turbine erect during @card@ in st. albans . another 3-bladed , @card@ m diameter machine , with fix pitch aluminium blade , install on the isle of man during @ord@ coincidental with this wind-power research be a political shift toward technological change that be influence Uk energy policy . the forthcoming prime minister , Harold Wilson , have be fervently promote technological advancement , part of which encourage new energy supply technology such as nuclear and wave power [ @card@ ] . in a speech to the labour party conference in @card@ , Wilson paint " an image of progress through technology and [ so ] provide a blueprint for modernisation , which crystallise around the ministry of technology ' [ @card@ ] . at the time , wave power be see by its supporter as the most favourable non-fossil fuel alternative source , although some hold reservation as to how much energy supply system such as nuclear and wave power could contribute to the nation ' s energy supply mix . nonetheless the " official view in the mid-1970 be that wave power be the only renewable energy option that merit support ' as some wave in sea around the coast of britain have a power density of about @card@ kw / m of wave front and so have the potential to supply a large proportion of the uk ' s electricity need [ @card@ , @card@ ] . so with the expectation in the 1960s of " abundant nuclear power which would be too cheap to meter ' , funding for wind power research in the uk be terminate [ @card@ ] . however , the oil price crisis of @card@ which increase the price of oil from usd @card@ to usd @card@ per barrel unexpectedly make renewable source of energy again of interest . as a result the era establish an industrial consortium for Uk wind power development , particularly that of horizontal axis turbine technology . this consortium become the wind energy group , ( weg ) in the early @card@ ' S , with tripartite participation by taylor woodrow construction , by hawker siddeley dynamics and by the Cleveland bridge and engineering company . Taylor woodrow construction , the large company in the whole taylor woodrow group , be then in @card@ division [ @card@ ] . one be the design and research division , within which sit the alternative energy system department , employ @card@ engineer responsible for the development of renewable energy supply business such as wave , tidal , biomass , and wind power . the major interest however be in wind power , which lead to taylor woodrow become the manage agent for the weg consortium . weg design , manufacture and install , the large , wind turbine ever build in the uk ; the @card@ m diameter , @card@ mw ha wt ls-1 locate at burgar hill , orkney in scotland . prior to this , weg have install a

@ord@ Uk large-scale wind power development policy
the uk ' s government-led wind energy programme , which begin in earnest in @card@ , be initially focus upon " determine the technical and economic feasibility of the [ wind power ] technology ' [ @card@ ] . however the programme subsequently evolve , progress from technical feasibility assessment activity ( which run during the mid-1970s to mid-1980s ) , to technology development and demonstration project ( which continue into the mid-1990 ) . during the 1970s and 1980s responsibility for the uk ' s wind energy research and development be part of the remit of the Uk government ' s department of energy , ( doe ) . after the doe have publish its assessment of " the prospect for the generation of electricity from wind energy in the united kingdom ' it be able , during @card@ , to further its wind energy programme by allocate £ @card@ , @card@ ( which be to be spend between @card@ and @card@ ) to wind energy research [ @card@ , @card@ ] . the remit of this part of the research programme be to evaluate industrial-scale , electricity generating turbine design . this include the aerodynamic efficiency of the machine , how much energy they be able to extract , as well as an analysis of structural engineering issue , such as operational vibration , stress , strain and cost [ @card@ ] . throughout this early phase of development of the Uk large wind turbine industry , it be think that an expansion of wind power be likely and would result in a need for associate concrete structure such as foundation and wind turbine tower . this attract civil engineering company such as t aylor woodrow , sir robert mcalpine and son ltd , and balfour beatty construction ltd. all these company become involve in wind turbine development , as they predict that the construction of wind power plant would provide a substantial market for their civil engineering expertise . so , during the 1970s and 1980s , the Uk ' s large-scale wind energy programme be be spearhead by consortium comprise large engineering company such as James Howden and Co. , the wind energy group ltd. ( which involve t aylor woodrow construction ) , and vertical axis wind turbine ltd. , ( which be a subsidiary of sir robert mcalpine and son , which later transmute into res ltd. ) . figure @card@ - @card@ show detail of the project [ @card@ ] . these consortia undoubtedly affect the form , pace , and direction of the Uk wind industry as these company co-operate in lobbying , but also pursue their own agenda . during the financial year @card@ / @card@ over @card@ % of the doe ' s total renewable energy research and development budget be plan to be spend on wind power , something that " underline the department ' s commitment to the development of wind energy technology ' and the doe ' s hope that the cost of electricity generate by wind power would fall to @card@ - @card@ p / kwh ( @card@ price ) [ @card@ ] . cumulatively until march , @card@ the doe have spend a total of £ @card@ million on wind energy , split as show in fig . 4 , with a further £ @card@ million plan for expenditure during @card@ / @card@ [ @card@ ] . during @card@ / @card@ the doe spend £ @card@ million on its large-wind machine programme , and approximately £ @card@ million " in support of underlie research and development ' [ @card@ ] . until @card@ , the doe have support Uk wind power development in two way , i.e. . , gain operational experience of the @card@ mw ls-1 Orkney ha wt and , separately , development of a @card@ kw , @card@ m diameter v wt at carmarthen bay construct by vertical axis wind turbine a

@ord@ conclusion
the carmarthen bay wind power programme provide a " shop window ' for the electricity supply industry , government , and the public to view the performance of what be then novel , large wind turbine . without this facility , Uk company would not have gain the valuable experience of operate a range of different cutting-edge horizontal and vertical axis wind machine . the uk ' s wind power test programme of the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s be therefore an example of how government and industry work together to push technological development . the carmarthen bay test have also leave a valuable legacy that be still shape worldwide wind power development . the fact remain however , that subsequent history show that no Uk manufacturer of wind turbine continue with a successful run of commercially market machine , neither in europe nor elsewhere . Danish wind turbine dominate the late Uk market , as elsewhere , to be join mostly by german manufacture machine . there be but a few us manufacture machine . the success of denmark , germany and spain in both manufacture and install capacity on their own network be surely due to their policy of feed-laws , rather than give development grant to specific company . the uk rely on support a small group of uk company , rather than encourage a market . whatever the success or otherwise of particular uk manufacture machine , their possible success be doom by lack of Uk market support . post script : Dr Musgrove , later join national wind power and be award a special lifetime achievement award at the bwea ' s 24th annual conference in @card@ .

how do a wind turbine work ?
wind turbine produce electricity by use the natural power of the wind to drive a generator . the wind be a clean and sustainable fuel source , it do not create emission and it will never run out as it be constantly replenish by energy from the sun . in many way , wind turbine be the natural evolution of traditional windmill , but now typically have three blade , which rotate around a horizontal hub at the top of a steel tower . most wind turbine start generate electricity at wind speed of around @card@ metre per second ( m / S ) , ( @card@ mile per hour ) ; generate maximum " rate ' power at around @card@ m / s ( 30mph ) ; and shut down to prevent storm damage at @card@ m / s or above ( 50mph ) . wind turbine technology generate electricity from the wind be simple : wind pass over the blade exert a turn force . the turbine rotate blade turn a shaft inside the nacelle , which go into a gearbox . the gearbox increase the rotation speed for the generator , which use magnetic ﬁelds to convert the rotational energy into

electrical energy . the power output go to a transformer , which convert the electricity from the generator at around @card@ volt ( v ) to the right voltage for the distribution system , typically between @card@ kv and @card@ kv . the regional electricity distribution network or national grid transmit the electricity around the country , and on into home and business .

offshore technology
offshore wind farm be an exciting new area for the industry , largely due to the fact that there be high wind speed available offshore and economy of scale allow for the installation of large size wind turbine offshore . offshore wind turbine technology be base on the same principle as onshore technology . foundation be construct to hold the superstructure , of which there be a number of design , but the most common be a driven pile . the top of the foundation be paint a bright colour to make it visible to ship and have an access platform to allow maintenance team to dock . subsea cable take the power to a transformer , ( which can be either offshore or onshore ) which convert the electricity to a high voltage ( normally between @card@ kv and @card@ kv ) before connect to the grid at a substation on land .

operation and maintenance
both onshore and offshore wind turbine have instrument on top of the nacelle , an anemometer and a wind vane , which respectively measure wind speed and direction . when the wind change direction , motor turn the nacelle , and the blade along with it , around to face into the wind . the blade also " pitch ' or angle to ensure that the optimum amount of power be extract from the wind . all this information be record by computer and transmit to a control centre , which can be many mile away . wind turbine be not physically staff , although each will have

periodic mechanical check , often carry out by local ﬁrms . the onboard computer also monitor the performance of each turbine component , and will automatically shut the turbine down if any problem be detect , alert an engineer that an onsite visit be require . the amount of electricity produce from a wind turbine depend on three factor : 1 ) wind speed the power available from the wind be a function of the cube of the wind speed . therefore if the wind blow at twice the speed , its energy content will increase eight-fold . turbine at a site where the wind speed average @card@ m / s produce around @card@ % more electricity than those where the average wind speed be @card@ m / S . 2 ) wind turbine availability this be the capability to operate when the wind be blow , i.e. . when the wind turbine be not undergo maintenance . this be typically @card@ % or above for modern European machine . 3 ) the way wind turbine be arrange

wind farm be lay out so that one turbine do not take the wind away from another . however other factor such as environmental consideration , visibility and grid connection requirement often take precedence over the optimum wind capture layout .

stand-alone and grid-connected small wind turbine
small scale wind turbine can be use in domestic , community and small wind energy project and these can be either stand-alone or grid-connected system . standalone system be use to generate electricity for charge battery to run small electrical application , often in remote location where it be expensive or not physically possible to connect to a main power supply . such example include rural farm and island community , with typical application be water heat or pump , electric livestock fencing , lighting or any kind of small electronic system need to control or monitor remote equipment . with grid-connected turbine the output from the wind turbine be directly connect to the existing main electricity supply . this type of system can be use both for individual wind turbine and for wind farm export electricity to the electricity network . a grid-connected wind turbine can be a good proposition if your consumption of electricity be high .

can we rely on the wind ?
wind generation be often describe as intermittent , as the wind do not blow continuously . this be a misnomer as it imply an " all or nothing ' delivery of energy . an individual wind turbine will generate electricity for @card@ % of the time and its electricity output vary between zero and full output in accordance with the wind speed . however , the combined output of the uk ' s entire wind power portfolio show less variability , give the difference in wind speed over the country as a whole . whilst the amount of wind generation vary , it rarely ( if ever ) go completely to zero , nor to full output . in order to maintain security of supply , a second-bysecond balance between generation and demand must be achieve . an excess of generation cause the system frequency to rise whilst an excess of demand cause the system frequency to fall . the electricity system be design and operate in such a way as to cope with large and small ﬂuctuations in supply and demand . no wind turbine nacelle . picture supply by slp energy . © Charles Hodge power station be totally reliable photography , lowestoft and demand be also uncertain . therefore , the system operator establish reserve that provide a capability to achieve balance give the statistic of variation expect over different timescales . the variability of wind generation be but one component of the generation and demand variation that be consider when set reserve level . the gb system operator , national grid transco state in their seven year statement that " base on recent analysis of the incidence and variation of wind speed we have find that the expect intermittency of wind do not pose such a major problem for stability and we be conﬁdent that this can be adequately managed.4 "

summary
wind turbine technology have develop and mature over the year and this technology now form an increasingly important part of the uk ' s electricity industry . renewable energy be vital in our ﬁght against climate change and technology such as wind energy can help in build a sustainable electricity generation system for the future .

executive summary
with the recent surge in fossil fuel price , demand for clean energy source , and government funding incentive , wind turbine have become a viable technology for power generation . currently , horizontal axis wind turbine ( hawt ) dominate the wind energy market due to their large size and high power generation characteristic . however , vertical axis wind turbine ( vawt ) be capable of produce a lot of power , and offer many advantage . the mechanical power generation equipment can be locate at ground level , which make for easy maintenance . also , vawt be omni-directional , mean they do not need to be point in the direction of the wind to produce power . finally , there be potential for large power generation with vawt because their size can be increase greatly . however , there be also downfall to the vawt . firstly , boundary layer affect from the ground influence the air stream incident on the vawt , which in some case lead to inconsistent wind pattern . secondly , vawt be not self-starting ; currently , an outside power source be require to start turbine rotation until a certain rotational speed be reach .

the main objective of this project be to design and build a self-starting vertical axis wind turbine . this report outline the first term effort in the design of our full-scale vawt , which be to be build early in the second term .

the self-starting issue surround vawt will be tackle by the use of alternative blade profile and pitch mechanism . a model that carry out turbine theory calculation be create to aid in the design of the full-scale turbine . the model input include naca @card@ airfoil lift and drag coefficient , angle of attack and relative wind speed as determine from a matlab program , and user input such as wind speed , tip speed ratio , overall blade and turbine dimension , and power require . the model output force and torque produce over a wide range of tsr . the model also use various angle of attack to determine performance result when pitching be use . analysis result indicate that passive pitching be an affect way to boost the turbine ability to selfstart . however , the naca @card@ profile be unable to achieve self-starting status , as it

ii

do not have large lift coefficient at low reynolds number . it be conclude that a profile with large lift at low speed use along with passive pitching could achieve selfstarting status . as a result , three blade profile will be test and compare over the holiday break in the wind tunnel facility at dalhousie university . result from prototype testing in the wind tunnel will reveal the blade profile that offer the good performance for self-starting .

the full-scale vawt will be approximately 10ft tall , with a blade height of 5ft , and a diameter of 8ft . three blade will be cnc machine from aluminum stock . the full-scale model will be build early next term to allow for adequate testing time .

to date the group have receive $ @card@ from richard rachals , $ @card@ from our client , the mechanical engineering department , and $ @card@ leave over from the previous year wind turbine design project . the primary expense of this project be the cost associate with cnc machine the three aluminum blade . other expense include bearing , a generation unit , and material . to cut down on cost , equipment from previous year design project will be use where applicable .

introduction

with the recent surge in fossil fuel price , demand for clean energy source , and government funding incentive , wind turbine be become a more viable technology for electrical power generation . fortunately there be an abundance of wind energy to be harness . currently , horizontal axis wind turbine ( hawt ) dominate commercially over vertical axis wind turbine ( vawt ) . however , vawt do have some advantage over hawt .

@card@ horizontal versus vertical axis wind turbine
the hawt be the most common turbine configuration . the propeller and turbine mechanism be mount high above the ground on a huge pedestal . it be a matter of taste as to whether they enhance the landscape . however , there be no deny that the height at which their mechanism be locate be a disadvantage when servicing be require . also , they require a mechanical yaw system to orient them such that their horizontal axis be perpendicular to and face the wind . as potential power generation be relate to the sweep area ( diameter ) of the rotor , more power require a large diameter . the blade experience large thrust and torque force , so size be limit by blade strength . figure @card@ show ge wind energy ' S @card@ megawatt hawt . large wind turbine be more efficient and cost effective .

a vawt do not need to be orient into the wind and the power transition mechanism can be mount at ground level for easy access . figure @card@ show a picture of an h-darrius rotor vawt .

the perceive disadvantage of the vawt be that they be not self-starting . however , it could be argue that the hawt be also not self-starting since it require a yaw mechanism for orientation . currently , vawt be usually rotate automatically until they reach the ratio between blade speed and undisturbed wind speed ( tip speed ratio or tsr ) that produce a torque large enough to do useful work . through the use of drag device and / or variable pitch blade design , it be hope that a vawt will be able to reach the require tsr without the use of a starter .

@card@ how wind energy be harness
turbine rely on drag , such as the anemometer and savonius model , can not spin faster than the wind blow and be thus limit to a tsr of less than @ord@ other turbine , such as the darrieus , rely on lift to produce a positive torque . lift type wind turbine can experience tsr as high as @ord@ this be possible because the natural wind be vector sum with the wind oppose the forward velocity of the airfoil . this combined velocity be know as the relative wind .

@card@ how turbine work
the wind impose two driving force on the blade of a turbine ; lift and drag . a force be produce when the wind on the leeward side of the airfoil must travel a great distance than that on the windward side . the wind travel on the windward side must travel at a great speed than the wind travel along the leeward side . this difference in velocity create a pressure differential . on the leeward side , a low-pressure area be create , pull the airfoil in that direction . this be know as the bernoulli ' S principle . lift and drag be the component of this force vector perpendicular to and parallel to the apparent or relative wind , respectively . by increase the angle of attack , as show in figure @card@ , the distance that the leeward air travel be increase . this increase the velocity of the leeward air and subsequently the lift . the bernoulli principle be illustrate in figure @card@ .

figure @card@ . effect of angle of attack on lift . [ ref , @card@ ]

lift and drag force can be break down into component that be perpendicular ( thrust ) and parallel ( torque ) to their path of travel at any instant . the torque be available to do useful work , while the thrust be the force that must be support by the turbine ' S structure .

@card@ turbine size as a function of power require .
the power of the wind be proportional to air density , area of the segment of wind be consider , and the natural wind speed . the relationship between the above variable be provide in equation [ @card@ ] below [ ref , @card@ ] .

a turbine can not extract @card@ % of the wind energy because some of the wind energy be use in pressure change occur across the turbine blade . this pressure change cause a decrease in velocity and therefore usable energy . the mechanical power that can be obtain from the wind with an ideal turbine be give as : pm = ½ ρ ( @card@ / @card@ au3 ) where pm : mechanical power ( w ) in equation [ @card@ ] , the area , a , be refer to as the sweep area of a turbine . for a vawt , this area depend on both the turbine diameter and turbine blade length . for an h-type vawt the equation for sweep area be :

[ @card@ ]

as = dt lb where as : sweep area ( m2 ) dt : diameter of the turbine ( m ) lb : length of the turbine blade ( m )

[ @card@ ]

@card@

the constant @card@ / @card@ = @card@ from equation [ @card@ ] be refer to as the betz coefficient . the Betz coefficient tell us that @card@ % of the power in the wind can be extract in the case of an ideal turbine . however , an ideal turbine be a theoretical case . turbine efficiency in the range of @card@ % be very good , and this be the case for most large-scale turbine . it should also be note that the pressure drop across the turbine blade be very small , around @card@ % of the ambient air pressure .

equation [ @card@ ] can be re-written as

pm = cp pw where cp : coefficient of performance .

[ @card@ ]

the coefficient of performance depend on wind speed , rotational speed of the turbine and blade parameter such as pitch angle and angle of attack . the pitch angle for a hawt be the angle between the blade motion and the chord line of the blade , whereas for a vawt the pitch angle be between the line perpendicular to the blade motion and the chord line of the blade . the angle of attack be the angle between the relative wind velocity and the centerline of the blade . for fix pitch turbine , these angle do not change and the Cp be directly relate to the tsr . see table @card@ for typical Cp value for various type of wind turbine .

example calculation @card@ : if we take the average wind speed to be @card@ m / s ( @card@ m / S for halifax ) , and consider a turbine 2.5m in diameter and 1.5m high , the power of the wind be , pw = @card@ ( 2.5m ) ( 1.5m ) ( 6m / S ) @card@ = @card@ ( w ) however , we know from the Betz coefficient that pw can not be obtain . use a Cp = @card@ ( @card@ % efficiency ) and the value of pw ( @card@ w ) calculate above , we can see that for a 2.5m x 1.5m turbine in @card@ m / s wind at stp , the mechanical power realize be : pm = @card@ ( 524w ) = @card@ w these equation can also be use to calculate the frontal area require from the output power require , wind speed , and the efficiency estimate . then , the linear dimension need to support that frontal area be calculate . generally , for both the eggbeater darrieus and the straight - blade design , the height roughly equal the diameter .

design process - engineering analysis model

self-starting be the major obstacle to be overcome for successful design of a vawt . it have be suggest [ ref , @card@ ] that pitch the turbine blade such that the pitch angle be not @card@ degree allow for self-starting . to understand the physics surround pitching , an in depth engineering analysis be carry out for a common airfoil profile , naca @ord@ performance datum and characteristic for the symmetric naca @card@ airfoil be available for analysis as the airfoil be commonly use in various application . the next series of paragraph explain the step involve in the engineering analysis of the naca @card@ airfoil with various pitching arrangement .

@card@ model input
a model be assemble so that various input be use to influence and generate desire output that describe the turbine performance . the model be excel base , with a matlab program for calculate additional information . the design team create the model to produce desire output from available input , and to avoid conduct repetition and lengthy calculation by hand .

model input be primarily control by a size spreadsheet as show in table @card@ . the key input of the size spreadsheet include tsr , and solidity , as solidity have effect on the chord length and blade height of the airfoil . the wind speed be keep constant throughout the engineering analysis at the average wind speed value for nova scotia of 6m / S .

another model input be the naca @card@ airfoil lift and drag coefficient , [ ref , @card@ ] . these coefficient be supply for various reynolds number , and be input into the model as a lookup table . naca @card@ lift and drag coefficient be supply in appendix a .

the primary objective of the engineering analysis model be to understand the effect of blade pitching . therefore , pitch angle be another require input for the model . it be know that during high rotational speed , the most efficient operation of the turbine occur when the pitch angle be zero , or state another way ; the angle of attack be @card@ º . as a result , blade pitching be only necessary during start up when large torque be need . a range of pitch angle be choose for the model analysis to determine how different angle affected performance . the range be input into the model as angle of attack that would be add to a pitch angle of 90º , and include angle of attack of @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , and @ord@ these @card@ angle of attack result in pitch angle range from 80º to 107º . the reason for not choose large or small pitch angle be that eventually the blade would have to return to 90º . angle further from the range choose would involve a large angle change and would likely induce turbulent flow over the airfoil .

@card@

@card@ model calculation
after the input be specify , the next step of the analysis involve calculation . the first calculation be to determine the reynolds number associate with the flow over the airfoil . the equation for reynolds number be give below as

re = where re : reynolds number w : wind speed ( m / s ) tsr : tip speed ratio

w × tsr × ρ air × cl

υair

[ @card@ ]

ρair : density of air ( kg / m3 )
cl : chord length ( m )

ν air : viscosity of air ( ns / m2 )
because the turbine be spin about a central shaft , the wind speed that the blade experience be not equal to the ambient wind speed . the angle of attack of the turbine blade be continuously change throughout the blade ' 360º revolution . as a result , the magnitude of the relative wind speed change throughout rotation , and be the parameter use to calculate the reynolds number as give in equation [ @card@ ] . because the relative wind speed change for each degree of the 360º revolution , and also change for different value of tsr , it would be monotonous to carry out the calculation for relative wind speed by hand . to avoid iterative calculation , a matlab program be write to automatically calculate the angle of attack and the relative wind speed for a specified tsr throughout the revolution of 0º to 360º . the matlab program be only able to output angle of attach and relative wind speed for one tsr ; therefore , the program have to be run numerous time to obtain angle of attack and relative wind speed for tsr range from @card@ through to @ord@ the matlab output file be convert to an excel file

@card@

and add to the analysis model . the matlab code for the mention program be provide in appendix c .

the model use the relative wind speed as specify by matlab to calculate the reynolds number as give by equation [ @card@ ] . after the reynolds number be calculate , the lift and drag coefficient can be obtain from the naca @card@ coefficient look up table . however , lift and drag coefficient be dependant on the reynolds number and the angle of attack . to calculate the angle of attack , the angle specify from the matlab program be add to the desire blade pitch angle of attack , as specify in the model input . because there be ten angle of attack be consider for the pitch analysis , it be necessary to carry out all calculation for ten scenario . once the actual angle of attack be determine , the model use the reynolds number along with the angle to lookup the appropriate lift and drag coefficient . when the lift and drag coefficient be determine , the lift and drag force can be calculate use the follow equation , respectively .

fl =

@card@ ρ airw @card@ × cl × bl × cl @card@ @card@ fd = ρ airw @card@ × cl × bl × cd @card@

[ @card@ , @card@ ]

where fl : lift force ( n ) fd : drag force ( n ) bl : blade length ( m ) cl : lift coefficient cd : drag coefficient the lift and drag force be then resolve into component parallel and perpendicular to the blade ' path of rotation . the follow four equation be use to resolve the lift and drag force into parallel and perpendicular component .

where
fl , help : force in direction of travel ( n ) fl , circ : force contribute to centrifugal force ( n ) fd , hurt : force oppose motion of blade travel ( n ) fd , circ : force contribute to centrifugal force ( n )

α actual : angle of attack with added pitching ( rad )
finally , parallel force be add , and perpendicular force be add to obtain expression for f1 and f2 , as give by equation [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] .

f1 = fl , help − fd , hurt f2 = fl , circ + fd , circ

[ @card@ , @card@ ]

where f1 : force contribute to torque ( n ) f2 : centrifugal force ( n ) the result force , f1 and f2 , be the force experience by a turbine with one blade rotate about a central axis . to obtain the force experience by a turbine with @card@ blade , the force be split at 180º and double . for example , the force experience by the first

@card@

blade at 90º be the same force to be experience by the 2nd blade at 270º . this be also do for a 3-blade turbine ; however , the force be split at 120º , and add three time .

as mention previously , there be ten angle of attack consider for this analysis . as a result , the above analysis be carry out for each angle to be consider , and also for tsr range from @card@ to @ord@ this range of tsr coverage provide a complete picture of how pitching effect turbine performance from start up to high rotational speed .

@card@ model output
the major result from the engineering analysis model be state below . graph be use to illustrate key point .

@card@ number of blade
before choose a final vawt design , it be necessary to determine the number of blade the turbine would have . for a 2-blade turbine , there be time when both blade be in a position such that the wind do not encourage rotation . this be know as the stall position . for a 3-blade turbine , the stall condition be eliminate . this be a conceptual reasoning ; however , the analysis model be use to test this conceptual reasoning . the original analysis in the model determine the overall force for a one-bladed turbine . these force be easily manipulate to represent overall force for a @card@ and 3-blade turbine . the result show that the 2-blade turbine generally produce a small average f1 than the 3-bladed design . for a 90º pitch angle , there be tsr range where the 2blade design produce large f1 than the 3-blade ; however , because the blade can be pitch at this low tsr range , and pitched blade produce a more favorable f1 result , it be note that the 3-blade design be still superior to the 2-blade design . as a result , the 3blade design be choose for the full scale vawt design . figure @card@ through @card@ illustrate the torque produce force , f1 , experienced by @card@ and 3-bladed turbine for tsr of @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @ord@ the pitch angle for figure @card@ through @card@ be keep constant at 90º so that the only variable among the figure be the tsr . figure @card@ though @card@ illustrate the

@card@

f1 force experience by @card@ and 3-blade design at tsr of @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ as well ; however , figure @card@ through @card@ be take at pitch angle other than 90º . it be note that at tsr below @card@ , the optimal pitch angle ( the pitch angle produce the large f1 ) , be 107º , while at tsr high than @card@ have optimal pitch angle close to 90º .

@card@ active pitching
active pitching involve the use of a mechanism or actuator to pitch the blade at various instance about the blade 360˚ revolution such that the maximum f1 be obtain throughout the entire revolution . as mention previously , the angle of attack continuously change throughout the 360º revolution of the blade around the turbine shaft . as a result , the optimal pitch angle continuously change . in some instance , the optimal angle of attack change in as little as 10º of blade revolution . note that the optimal angle of attack be define as the angle of attack that give the large f1 . physically change the pitch angle every 5º or 10º of revolution be not physically possible , especially at high rotational speed . also , the optimal angle of attack sometimes vary between as low as 85º to as high as 105º in 5º of revolution . this be highly impractical , not only in the physical sense , but also because it would disturb the

@card@

flow over the airfoil , cause turbulent flow and therefore not generate a continuous or steady lift force . figure @card@ show f1 fluctuation about the 360º revolution for @card@ different pitch angle at a tsr of @card@ . it be clear from figure @card@ that when certain pitch angle be at a low f1 value , other pitch angle achieve high f1 . table @card@ show the pitch angle that produce the maximum f1 for every 5º of revolution . it can be see from table @card@ that the pitch angle vary very frequently , which would relate to a constantly move blade .

it be possible ; however , to choose two pitch angle such that one angle be optimal while the other be not , and vice-versa . if this can be do , and if the two pitch angle be within a close range to each other , it could be practical to vary the pitch angle between these two angle during the blade ' revolution . figure @card@ show the average f1 for all ten pitch

figure @card@ . average f1 for pitch angle of 80º through 107º for a tsr of @card@ . to achieve this vary pitch , a mechanical device such as an actuator would be require . as our design requirement specify that a self-starting turbine with no external power source will be fabricate , the outside power source need to run the actuator would violate the design requirement . as a result of the active pitching analysis , it be conclude that continuously vary the pitch angle be , in many case , not a practical solution to achieve self-starting .

@card@

@card@ passive pitching
the idea of passive pitching be that an initial pitch angle other than 90º be set with a spring , and when the turbine reach a certain rotational speed , the force from the blade pull on the spring , extend it such that the blade achieve a pitch angle of 90º , again , to achieve maximum performance . result from the analysis model be use to determine what pitch angle would be optimal before the turbine reach a desire speed where the blade could return to 90º . from the analysis , it be determine that a pitch angle of @card@ degree provide the large average torque over the range of tsr from @card@ to @card@ . a printout of the model result for various pitch angle from a tsr range of @card@ , to @card@ be provide numerically in appendix b . these table present the overall performance of difference pitch angle at difference tsr , and they clearly show that the pitch angle of 107º be optimal for tsr below @card@ . the naca @card@ , however , experience very low torque around a tsr of @card@ , which represent the " deadband ' phenomenon . although the torque produce in this tsr range be positive , they be only slightly positive . after a tsr of @card@ , the maximum average torque be obtain with pitch angle close to @card@ degree . again , these result be show in the table in appendix b .

@card@ analysis conclusion
as a result of the engineering analysis carry out for the naca @card@ airfoil at various pitch angle , it be show that the " deadband ' phenomenon could be overcome , but only slightly . to overcome the " deadband ' with a level on confidence , torque in the tsr range of @card@ to @card@ must be increase to value further above zero . to achieve this , an airfoil with high lift coefficient at low reynolds number be need . it have be suggest that both the naca @card@ [ ref , @card@ ] and the naca @card@ [ ref , @card@ ] experience these characteristic . the naca @card@ , another symmetric airfoil , have a fat profile than the naca @card@ , while the naca @card@ be a camber airfoil , mean that the airfoil have a curve shape rather than a symmetric one . camber blade be also think to experience good performance on small-scale turbine because the backwash from the blade be aim in the direction of successive blade travel . the team be unable to find

evidence to prove that the naca @card@ and @card@ experience large lift coefficient than the naca @card@ at low reynolds number . however , datum be find for the naca @card@ and @card@ for high reynolds number , and the trend in lift coefficient show large value than the naca @card@ experience at the same high reynolds number . although it be think that these lift coefficient trend may continue into low reynolds number , it be not know for certain . as the mention airfoil be usually use in application with fast wind speed , the area of vawt self-starting be fairly new so there be not a lot of information available for low speed application such as this . to determine which profile have the good performance at low speed , prototype testing will be carry out with the three profile as a mean to compare performance datum . result from the prototype testing will be use to determine which profile will be use for the full-scale model vawt .

@card@ base
the base from previous year design project will be reuse for our project . the existing steel base will be modify with a steel connect bracket and plywood base extension . the base component be discuss below .

@card@ steel base
we plan to use the base from previous year design project , with a few modification . the base be steel and stand approximately @card@ foot high and weigh roughly @card@ lbs , as show in figure @card@ . on its own the base will not support the torque and moment produce from our wind turbine , so a base extension and a connect bracket will be require . a cad drawing of the steel base be show in appendix d .

@card@ plywood base extension
to modify the base , we be go to purchase @card@ sheet of @card@ ' x @card@ ' x ¾ " plywood to construct a base extension that will give us a large footprint on which to place weight . a cad drawing be provide in appendix d . for our purpose , we have determine that sandbag will be the optimal blend between weight , cost effectiveness , and transportability . the plywood sheet will be orient with @card@ sheet side-by-side , with @card@ other sheet on top at @card@ degree rotation to the bottom @card@ sheet . reinforce @card@ ' x @card@ ' base . this create a

@card@ steel connect bracket
to connect the @card@ sheet of plywood to the steel base we will use a bottom bracket make of @card@ / @card@ " x @card@ ½ " steel , as show in appendix d . this bottom bracket will be bolt from the bottom up through the sheet of plywood and up through the steel base . this @card@ " x @card@ " structure will provide quick assembly and disassembly of the turbine base structure . the bottom bracket will require @card@ simple corner weld and flat head bolt weld in position that will encourage quick assembly .

@card@

figure @card@ . existing turbine base structure from previous year design project .

@card@ shaft
the shaft from exist design project will be use for our project . to minimize weight , the @card@ ½ " , @card@ ½ " diameter section of the shaft will be mill down to @card@ @card@ / @card@ " to make the shaft uniform and to reduce weight . the existing shaft can be see in figure @card@ , and a cad drawing of the shaft , show the section to be mill , be provide in appendix d .

@card@

figure @card@ . exist shaft from previous year design project .

@card@ bearing
minimize required start-up torque be essential for the wind turbine to self-start and thus , the success of our project . without proper bearing our wind turbine will either not operate properly , or ruin the bearing that be use improperly , which could result in unsafe operate condition . the bearing that be use in previous year wind turbine design project , show in figure @card@ , be inferior unit that be not salvageable . bearing can be very expensive , and for our particular setup we will require @card@ roller bearing that be go to primarily centralize the shaft , and a turntable bearing to take the majority of the weight . this combination will provide the least amount of friction , while maximize bearing life and maintain safe operate condition .

@card@

figure @card@ . bearing from previous year design project .

@card@ center mount
in order to connect the radial arm and the turbine blade to the center shaft , there need to be a strong connection that will withstand the centrifugal and inertial force cause by the rotation of the wind turbine . the center shaft mount , machine from aluminum , will slide over the end of the shaft and will be fasten with setscrew , enable quick assembly and disassembly . the three radial arm will be bolt into the center mount via female clamp at @card@ degree angle of separation . this will be a one-piece unit , design use finite element analysis , to minimize weight and to reduce the possibility of failure . a cad drawing of the center mount be provide in appendix d .

@card@

@card@ radial connect arm
aluminum will be use for the six radial connect arm to maintain a lightweight assembly with minimal inertial , moment , and centrifugal force . the connect arm provide a mean to mount the blade to the center mount and thus the center shaft . there will be two @card@ / @card@ " bolt connect each arm to the center mount , while a pivot device allow the blade to pitch on the opposite end . the arm will be purchase as ½ " x @card@ ½ " and may need to be cut to the appropriate @card@ ' length . the arm edge will be round to reduce drag . a cad drawing of the radial arm be provide in appendix d .

@card@ airfoil
select appropriate airfoil for our 3-bladed vertical axis wind turbine be one of the most important design decision . different profile provide various advantage and disadvantage that must be consider . wind tunnel prototype testing result will provide information that will be use to choose the optimal blade profile for a self-starting application . once a profile be select , @card@ blade will be cnc machine from aluminum flat-bar into an accurate representation of the selected airfoil . the estimated weight of each aluminum airfoil be @card@ lbs . the top and bottom of each blade will be a @card@ " x @card@ " x @card@ " deep rectangular section to allow for easy connection to the radial arm and passive pitch system . a cad drawing of the airfoil be provide in appendix d .

@card@ blade connect assembly
the blade connect assembly will be use to connect the blade to the radial arm . the current design be to drill a @card@ / @card@ " hole through the radial arm , and also into the blade to a depth of @card@ " . a steel dowel will be use for the connection . a washer and bushing will be locate between the connect arm and the top of the blade , and a set screw cap will

@card@

secure the blade to the radial connect arm . assembly be provide in figure @card@ .

@card@ pitching device
pitch the turbine blade be think to improve turbine performance characteristic . the follow pitch design have be discuss ; however , our choose blade pitch design will be determine in early January .

@card@ linear spring / slot bracket pitch system
for this design , a linear spring will be connect to the radial arm . it will initially be in compression when the turbine be at rest , pull the pointed end of the airfoil towards the center of the turbine . as the turbine begin to rotate , the centrifugal force will apply tension to the spring , and the blade will gradually be let out . this design will be use in @card@

conjunction with a slot bracket to ensure that the blade pitch between the desire pitch angle . figure @card@ show the linear spring pitch design , while figure @card@ show the slot bracket . the first diagram in figure @card@ show the start-up blade orientation , set at the optimal pitch angle of 107˚ . as the tsr increase , the centrifugal force increase . when the tsr reach @card@ , the centrifugal force will be enough such that the force cause the spring to extend until the pitch angle be 90˚ . also incorporate into the linear spring pitch design will be a stop mechanism such that the blade be not able to rotate to a pitch angle small than 90˚ . this stop will be design such that the force on the blade while it be in the 90˚ position will not be hold by the spring . the stop device will also be use to withstand the centrifugal force for this condition .

@card@ pitch control bracket to manipulate the pitch angle
for this design , three pitching control bracket will be machine from aluminum as see in figure @ord@ these bracket will be bolt to the top radial arm and will have a series of hole drill to correspond to different pitch angle . the blade will have a pin in the top to align with the bracket hole . the slot bracket be show in figure @card@ .

conclusion

the first part of the design process , which include research , brainstorming , engineering analysis , and turbine design selection be complete during the fall term . the initial research and analysis portion of the project provide its share of complication ; however , once complete it provide valuable information about the final design . to date , the major component of the turbine have be settle on , in particular , full-scale aluminum blade have be choose , and will be machine in the cnc lab at dalhousie . there be still some final design option that must be finalize , and these decision will be make before turbine construction begin in early January .

testing will be a major part of the design selection , as blade profile selection will occur over the christmas break base on prototype testing result . the test result should provide insight as to which blade profile provide the most torque and show the most significant effect due to blade pitching . in addition to prototype testing , finite element analysis will be perform on each blade profile in an effort to confirm the wind tunnel result . the blade connector and pitch system design will also be finalize , and a spring selection for the passive pitching system will be make . a device use to couple the torque transducer and generator to the shaft will be design as well . this will occur in conjunction with the selection of a generator , and design of a device that would couple the generator to the turbine after it reach a certain rotational speed . the last item to be decide on be a brake mechanism that must be incorporate into the design for safety reason . these item will be decide on before issue of the second build report in January .

construction of the full-scale turbine will begin during the first week of the winter term , with the goal of finish the final product by the end of February . this will allow for a month of testing and data analysis , as well as provide time for make any design alteration that be need . a project timeline for the second term can be see in the Gantt chart in appendix e . base on current progress , the group be confident that the final product will meet all the requirement set out in the fall term .

@card@

finally , the group will like to thank dr. murat koksal and dr. larry hughes for their ongoing guidance , as well as the mechanical engineering department technician for their help with prototype testing . thanks be also extend to richard rachals and the mechanical engineering department for their donation to the project .

of the output voltage and frequency . application to wind-power plant of open-loop ( steinbuch , @card@ ) and closed-loop ( Madsen , @card@ ; sandhu and dias , @card@ ) classical control technique can be find in the literature . in the present paper we propose the estimator-based adaptive fuzzy logic ( eafl ) control , which represent an innovative type of adaptive fuzzy logic control system ( Mendel , @card@ ; Andersen et al . , @card@ ) . the eafl controller continuously optimize the internal parameter of the fuzzy logic rule base , in order to adapt these parameter to the system-dynamic behavior ( Mendel , @card@ ; Andersen et al . , @card@ ) . indeed , start from a ﬁrst glance fuzzy logic rule base , the eafl minimize a cost function in order to adapt the fuzzy controller parameter to the controlled wind system . this control technique employ a gradient descent algorithm to minimize the cost function which be base on the control error estimate one step ahead . such error be estimate by use the least square algorithm ( lsa ) in recursive form ( goodwin and sin , @card@ ; Dambrosio , @card@ ; dadone et al . , @card@ ) . the eafl require the observability of the controlled plant , while it do not require any a priori knowledge of its deterministic model . in the present paper , instead of a real wind plant , a numerically simulated wind system be consider . in particular , a rather simple momentum model for the wind turbine be adopt , while a complete dynamic model of the rotor and stator winding of the induction generator be employ ( Fitzgerald et al . , @card@ ) . take into account that the power plant be assume to be an isolated power source , the disturbance here consider be the wind speed variability and the external load change . obviously , the eafl have to counterbalance such disturbance variable in order to control the system output represent by the voltage and by the rotational speed of the self-excited induction generator . the required control be obtain by act on the control variable , which be assume to be the resistance of the induction generator rotor winding ( Fitzgerald et al . , @card@ ) and the transmission ratio of the gear box . in the next section , the mathematical model of the horizontal wind turbine and of the induction electrical generator be ﬁrst outline . next , the fuzzy logic system and the estimatorbased adaptive fuzzy logic control technique be describe . finally , some result of the application of the eafl control algorithm to the numerically model wind system be present .

@card@ model of the horizontal-axis wind turbine
the mathematical model of a horizontal-axis wind turbine here employ be base on the stream-tube discretization ( Wilson and lisseman , @card@ ) . momentum conservation in both the axial and tangential direction be consider . the aerodynamic characteristic of the wind turbine blade be represent by the lift ( cl ) and drag ( cd ) coefﬁcients , which depend on the inﬂow angle . accord to wilson and lisseman ( @card@ ) , the thrust and torque act on a blade element Dr , at a distance r from the center of the rotor , be give by cos φ cd 1+ tan φ Dr , sin2 φ cl cd @card@ sin φ dq = ρ π r2 σ ( @card@ + a ) @card@ ( ω r ) @card@ cl 1− Dr , 2φ cos cl tan φ dt = ρ π r σ ( @card@ − a ) @card@ v0 @card@ cl

mathematical model of the self-excited induction generator

the wind turbine drive a three phase self-excited induction generator . since the stator and rotor winding of the induction generator together with the external load be balance , a perphase analysis can be adopted ( Fitzgerald et al . , @card@ ) . accordingly , a ﬁxed axis reference system , dq , can be use to determine the govern equation of both the stator and rotor winding ( Fitzgerald et al . , @card@ ) : v1d = r1 i1d + l1 v1q = r1 i1q @card@ = r2 i2d @card@ = r2 i2q d i1d dt d i1q + l1 dt d i2d + l2 dt d i2q + l2 dt + lm + lm + lm + lm d i2d , dt d i2q , dt d i1d + p ωg ( l2 i2q + lm i1q ) , dt d i1q − p ωg ( l2 i2d + lm i1d ) , dt

( @card@ )

where r1 and r2 be the stator and rotor internal resistance , respectively , while l1 and l2 be the corresponding inductance . moreover , lm , ωg , and p represent the mutual inductance , the rotor angular speed , and the number of polar pair , respectively . the voltage v1d , v1q and the current i1d , and i1q have no direct physical meaning , although they be relate to the phase voltage and current , as it will be show lately . be the external load represent by a capacity , c , an inductance , l , and a resistance , r ,

( @card@ )

( @card@ ) , ( @card@ ) and ( @card@ ) represent a set of nine equation in the nine unknown i1d , i1q , i2d , i2q , v1d , v1q , ild , ilq , e ωg , which can be solve , provide that the wind turbine torque be compute by mean of Eq . ( @card@ ) . finally , the phase voltage can be obtain from the unphysical voltage v1d and v1q by mean of the follow relation : va = v1d , vb vb √ @card@ @card@ v1q , = − v1d + @card@ @card@ √ @card@ @card@ v1q . = − v1d − @card@ @card@ ( @card@ )

the fuzzy logic system ( fls ) employ a set of n fuzzy linguistic rule . these rule may be provide by expert or can be extract from numerical datum . in either case , engineering rule in fls be express as a collection of if − then statement . therefore a fuzzy rule base r contain n fuzzy rule can be express as : r = [ rule1 , rule2 , ... , rulei , ... , rulen ] , where the i-th rule be : ˜ rulei : ifz ( k ) be a then u ( k ) be βi , where k refer to the variable value at time t = k ∆t . moreover , the vector z ( k ) = [ z1 ( k ) , ... , zl ( k ) ] t ( @card@ ) ( @card@ ) ( @card@ )

estimator-based adaptive fuzzy logic

in general , an adaptive fuzzy logic ( afl ) control start from an initially assume set of parameter θ ( @card@ ) , whose only requirement be to stabilize the plant . then , at each time step , the afl control adapt the set of parameter θ ( k ) , in order to minimize the cost function : j ( k ) = where ey ( k ) be the control error deﬁned as : ey ( k ) = r ( k ) − y ( k ) . ( @card@ ) @card@ @card@ e ( k ) , @card@ y ( @card@ )

the control error ey ( k ) can be determine only if a deterministic model of the controlled system be available . in the present paper , we suppose that no a priori deterministic model of the controlled system be available . the estimator-based adaptive fuzzy logic ( eafl ) control here suggest allow to solve this class of problem . indeed , instead of derive the appropriate change in each internal parameter from the control error ey ( k ) , the eafl refer to an approximate estimation of the control error ey ( k ) = r ( k ) − y ( k ) , ^ ^ ( @card@ ) and to the corresponding cost function : @card@ ^ j ( k ) = e2 ( k ) . ^ @card@ y ( @card@ )

in Eq . ( @card@ ) , y ( k ) represent the estimated value of the output at the time k , to be evaluate . ^ as state in ( goodwin and sin , @card@ ) , the present system , can be express as follow : y ( k ) = ak y ( k − @card@ ) + Bk u ( k − @card@ ) , ( @card@ )

where ak and Bk represent the time-varying coefﬁcients of model ( @card@ ) . if the controlled plant be observable , then eq . ( @card@ ) represent its model in state space notation . in such a case , the model coefﬁcients ak and Bk be unknown . these coefﬁcients can be on-line estimate by apply the least square algorithm ( lsa ) in recursive form ( goodwin and sin , @card@ ; Dambrosio , @card@ ; dadone et al . , @card@ ) . as a consequence , the basic scheme of the fuzzy control system have to ^ be modiﬁed as show in fig . @card@ , where the lsa estimator evaluate the coefﬁcients ak and Bk . ^ assume that such coefﬁcients do not change from the time k to the time k + @card@ , the estimated

result

in the compute application , we have consider a control system start from rest . we have also assume that the control system reach a steady-state condition after a start time interval . during such a steady-state time period , we have hypothesize that appropriate disturbance perturb the system status . the control system act during the start time interval in order to guarantee the required time sequence of the system status . moreover , during the steady-state time period , the control system have to counteract the disturbance effect , in order to preserve the desire steady-state condition . the aim target be to control the output voltage and the rotational speed of the induction generator . the control variable be the rotor resistance , r2 , and the transmission ratio , τ , of the gear box connect the wind turbine to the induction generator . in the presently consider control case , the system disturbance be represent by abrupt change of the wind velocity and of the resistance load . in particular , we have assume that the wind velocity instantaneously change from @card@ m / S to @card@ m / S at time t = @card@ s , while it instantaneously return to the original value at t = @card@ s. as far as the resistance load disturbance be concern , we have assume an instantaneous change from @card@ ω to @card@ ω at t = @card@ S and an opposite variation at t = @card@ s. figure . @card@ show the time history of the rotational speed , ωg , of the induction generator , while fig . @card@ present the corresponding percentage control error , ∆ω % . in fig . 3 , dotted and solid line represent the target and the actual rotational speed , respectively . a quick glance to such ﬁgures allow to state that the actual and the target angular speed be practically coincident during the consider time interval with the obvious exception of small error during the very ﬁrst part of the start time interval . in particular , the disturbance effect , act during the steady state time interval , appear to be effectively counteract by the present control system . the only evidence of the disturbance action be represent by the small spike in fig . 4 ( ∆ω % < @card@ % ) due to the instantaneous variation of the disturbance variable . figure . @card@ show the output voltage , v , while fig . @card@ represent the corresponding percentage error , ∆v % . as show in fig . @card@ , the actual and the target output voltage be practically coincident for most of the consider time interval . nevertheless , signiﬁcant difference between the actual and the target voltage can be observe at the beginning of the start period . such difference be due to the lack of the auto-excitation of the induction generator at the very beginning of the start interval . obviously , such error can not be suppress by any control system . moreover , fig . @card@ show two signiﬁcant spike , during the steady state time interval , which denote the voltage sensitivity to the instantaneous change of the resistance load , while no practical effect of the instantaneous change of the wind velocity can be notice . finally , ﬁgures . @card@ and @card@ show the time variation of the control variable , i.e. . , the gear box transmission ratio , τ , and the rotor resistance , r2 . these variable vary in accordance to the disturbance , in order to counterbalance their effect . such an important characteristic prove

introduction

@card@ background
wind energy be the fast grow source of energy in the world today , with an average growth rate of nearly @card@ % per year for the past @card@ year . 1 the u.s. installed capacity surge @card@ % in @card@ , now total more than @card@ , @card@ mw , which generate an estimate @card@ billion kilowatt-hour ( kwh ) , enough to power @card@ million home . @card@ for many utility company , wind energy have become not only the renewable energy of choice , but also the least-cost option for new generation . with global warming , energy security , and rise fuel price be main public concern , it be feasible to assume that the growth of the wind energy industry will continue . however , it be still important to improve upon the technology in order to keep wind energy economically competitive with traditional and other renewable energy source . this be do by lower the cost of energy ( Coe ) , which can be accomplish in a number of different way . there be three independent variable that go into calculate the cost of energy ; the energy capture of the turbine over its lifetime , the capital cost of the turbine , and the operation and maintenance ( o & m ) cost . o & m cost can be further divide into scheduled and unscheduled cost . coe = lifetime energy capture capital cost + o & m cost
( eqn . 1 )

there be several different way to lower the Coe .

by simply look at the

equation , one way be to make more reliable turbine , thereby reduce the downtime and o & m cost . another be to decrease the amount of material or improve manufacturing technique that would allow the capital cost to drop . technological advance to wind

@card@

turbine be become even more critical because capital cost be rise due to increase raw material cost , high turbine demand , and increase cost of energy input . another technique use to reduce the Coe be by increase the rotor diameter and turbine size ; this have be happen since the beginning of the commercial wind industry . a large turbine can capture more energy throughout its lifetime , and although the cost of the turbine will increase and potentially o & m will increase as well , the Coe have be able to decrease . significant growth of wind turbine size and weight over the past few decade have make it impossible to control turbine passively as they be control in the past . modern turbine rely on sophisticated control system that assure safe and optimal operation under a variety of atmospheric condition . as turbine grow in size , the structural and fatigue load become more pronounced . implement new and innovative load control technique could decrease excessive load , which affect the rotor and surround component . extreme structural and fatigue load be key factor in turbine design and the reduction of these load could create a significant decrease in turbine cost by reduce require material , lessen scheduled and unscheduled maintenance , and improve overall turbine reliability . this engineering challenge , which be economically drive by the push to lower the Coe , have lead to intensive research around the globe to improve the technique of control rotor power and load . there be four area that influence the control of rotor power and turbine load for a give wind speed . they can all be address when analyze the lift equation for a wind turbine blade .

( eqn . 2 )

blade incidence angle ( variable pitch ) - θ pitch flow velocity ( variable speed rotor ) - n blade size ( variable blade length ) - b blade section aerodynamics - c lα , α o

the blade incidence angle , θ pitch , can be control by pitch the blade and / or by design an aeroelastic twist into the blade . flow velocity be adjust by use a variable-speed rotor , n , where n = rpm / @card@ . these two control technique ( variable speed and blade pitch ) be implement on most modern machine . variable diameter rotor , b , would allow control over the blade size and be be investigate as a mean to increase energy capture and minimize load during high wind . the fourth area , and the focus of this report , be the control of blade section aerodynamics , c lα and α o , by implement active flow control ( afc ) method . the remain portion of this chapter discuss the development in wind turbine control and introduce some new control method . chapter @card@ provide a general background on active flow control . in chapter @card@ , the various active flow control device be present and discuss .

@card@ wind turbine control
turbine control can be divide into two category , passive control and active control . a considerable amount of research have be perform in these two area . passive technique improve the turbine ' S performance and / or reduce load without external

@card@

energy expenditure .

example of this include the yaw movement of a free-to-yaw

downwind rotor and aeroelastic blade twist . active control require external energy , or auxiliary power . therefore , more in depth study must be conduct to ensure that the increase in energy output can offset the external energy require for load control as well as the increase in turbine capital and o & m cost . some traditional method of active control be rotor yaw , blade pitch , and variable-speed rotor . example of advanced active flow control device be trailingedge flap , microtabs , and synthetic jet . these and other device be discuss in detail in chapter @card@ of this report . a flow chart show the avenue of turbine control and some example be show in fig . @card@ .

fig . @card@ flow chart show wind turbine load control technique .

@card@

in general , the goal of wind turbine control be to balance the follow requirement : @card@ @ord@ set upper bound on and limit the torque and power experience by the drive train , principally the low-speed shaft . @ord@ minimize the fatigue life extraction from the rotor drive train and other structural component due to change in wind direction , speed ( include gust ) , and turbulence , as well as start-stop cycle of the wind turbine . @ord@ maximize energy production . requirement # @card@ be directly relate to the load experience by the turbine during operation . the load can be divide into two main category : aerodynamic and

structural . 4 these load be relate by the aeroelastic coupling . the relative velocity around the blade section influence the aerodynamic load on the rotor . most of these load occur in a periodic nature ( appear in multiple of the rotor frequency ) but some stochastic component also exist . the contribute factor to these load be horizontal or vertical wind shear , tower shadow , turbulence , and yaw and tilt misalignment.4 in addition to the two main category of load , gravitational force can also have an impact by produce periodic structural loading on the rotor blade . to minimize these load , control system should be able to reduce the fluctuation of the aerodynamic load or add damp to the structural mode . 5 the immediate goal of the control strategy depend on the operate region of the turbine , which be determine by the wind speed . fig . @card@ illustrate the four distinct operate region .

@card@

fig . @card@ typical power curve of a commercial wind turbine , show the four operate region .

in region i , the wind speed be too low for the turbine to generate power . region ii , also call the sub-rated power region , lie between the cut-in speed and rate speed . here the generator operate at below rate power . the theoretical shape of this curve reflect the basic law of power production , where power be proportional to the cube of the wind speed . in region iii , the power output be limit by the turbine ; this occur when the wind be sufficient for the turbine to reach its rate output power . region iv be the period of strong wind , where the power in the wind be so great that it could be detrimental to the turbine , so the turbine shut down .

@card@ development in wind turbine operation for load control
at the beginning of the commercial wind energy industry , turbine operation be simple . the turbine be small ( ten or hundred of kws in rate power ) , operate at a constant speed and use passive method ( stall control ) to regulate power . the turbine be equip with rotor blade that be design to intrinsically regulate the power use fixed-pitch design to operate near optimal tip-speed in region ii . as the wind

speed increase , the angle of attack increase and the flow about the blade would begin to stall , thereby increase drag and limit the amount of absorbed power . the

simplicity of this control concept contribute to wind energy ' s rapid success ; however , the evolution towards large rotor blade soon make this control concept uneconomical . nowadays , most large turbine ( one to several mws in rate power ) use variablespeed rotor combine with active collective blade pitch to optimize energy yield and control load . in region ii , turbine tend to operate at fix pitch use variable rotor speed to maintain an optimal tip-speed ratio and maximize energy capture . in region iii , the rotor operate at near constant speed and the blade be pitch to maintain the torque within acceptable limit . the control of the blade pitch and rotor speed have not only lead to great power regulation , but also to light blade construction due to a low load spectrum and a light gear box due to reduce torque peaks.4 difficulty arise in turbulent wind when excessive loading ( both extreme and fatigue load ) occur , which lead to premature wear on turbine component . use current technology , it be difficult to mitigate these load ; pitch of the entire blade be too slow and variable rotor speed allow shed for some of the high load , but not all . the need to mitigate excessive load have lead to investigation of new method of control .

@card@ investigation into new control method
variable-speed rotor and collective pitch be not capable of handle oscillatory or fatigue load . these load occur as a result of rotor yaw error , wind shear , wind upflow , shaft tilt , wind gust , and turbulence in the wind flow . @card@ more sophisticated control method be need to account for these load . some method that will be present in

replaced-ip description
pitch be the act of rotate each blade around its spanwise axis in order to change the effective angle of attack to the wind . it be use to limit the peak power , optimize rotor efficiency , and slow down the rotor . the traditional method of pitch control use a collective mode , in which all blade be adjust simultaneously . advanced method of pitch control ( cyclic pitch and individual pitch ) be be investigate . these innovative concept be first develop for the rotorcraft field and have be adapt to the wind industry . @card@ cyclic pitch control vary the blade pitch angle with a phase shift of @card@ ° to alleviate the load variation cause by rotor tilt and yaw error , whereas individual pitch control adjust the pitch angle of each individual blade independently . this method require the measurement of the local inflow angle and relative flow velocity for each blade . the goal be to create two load-reducing system ( collective pitch and individual pitch ) that be independent , where collective pitch be use to keep the power at a desire level by adjust pitch base on the mean wind speed and the individual pitch regulator be to minimize load without affect the power output . @card@ cyclic and individual pitch control can reduce fatigue load due to yaw error , wind shear , up flow and shaft tilt . not only do the blade benefit from this control strategy , but reduction in load on the drive train , nacelle structure , and tower be also see . however

@card@

these control technique be less capable of reduce the load due to wind gust and turbulence . @card@

replaced-ip background
research by Larsen , Madsen , and thomsen8 and by bossanyi9 have show that load reduction be possible use advanced pitch control . they conduct aeroelastic

replaced-ip wind turbine control
there be three major concern when consider individual pitch control.6 first , the entire blade still must be pitch . the flow condition along a long blade be not uniform and therefore pitch the entire blade may not be ideal . second , the pitch mechanism may be unable to act fast enough to relieve the oscillate load due to wind gust . these

@card@

gust have rise time on the order of a couple of second and last for @card@ to @card@ second ; the international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) wind turbine design standard call for consideration of an extreme gust that last for @card@ second where the wind speed increase by @card@ % from the mean wind in a period of just over two second . @card@ third , there be a concern that individual blade pitch will result in over-use of the pitch mechanism . it be important to design turbine to use individual pitch from the start ; retrofit current turbine with individual pitch control will lead to premature failure of the pitch mechanism due to the result high duty cycle . challenge with implementation include response time requirement to counter load perturbation , the need large pitch motor , and the power require to operate the system under a new control strategy.6 @card@ blade twist control

replaced-ip description @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@
one concept for control fatigue load on a wind turbine blade be to use passive blade bend-twist coupling13-18 . the aeroelastic tailored blade be design so that the twist distribution change as the blade bend due to aerodynamic load . this be now possible through the advent of composite material , which can be implement in a deliberate fashion to control flap-twist coupling . for example , an off-axis ( e.g. . @card@ ° ) orientation of reinforcement fiber ( e.g. . glass , carbon , kevlar , etc . ) along a support spar will cause the spar to twist under sufficient bend strain.18 the transient load due to wind gust theoretically could be reduce because the blade would twist towards low angle of attack , thereby mitigate the load and potentially reduce pitch activity as well .

replaced-ip wind turbine control
some of the challenge with this concept include reduce energy capture , high cost , and blade integrity issues.18 first , reduce energy capture may occur due to alter a blade that be design for optimum energy capture at rate speed by cause it to twist . basically , energy as well as load will be shed . second , high cost associate with material and manufacturing technique may make the concept uneconomical . third , the fabrication technique may lead to decrease stiffness and additional material may be require to counteract additional blade deflection . active blade twist control can be conceptually achieve by embed active laminate such as piezoelectric material in the spar cap of the blade . there be several challenge that face this concept , include blade structural integrity , cost of active material , and actuation power requirements.6 @card@ variable diameter rotor

replaced-ip description
this concept @card@ , @card@ be capable of improve energy capture in low wind speed and reduce load on the rotor in high wind condition . variable diameter rotor operate by extend / retract a tip blade out of a root blade ( fig . @card@ ) to increase / decrease the diameter ( fig . @card@ ) . during low-wind speed , a large rotor diameter provide more

@card@

capture area , which result in large aerodynamic load and an increase in energy capture . however , this operation generate large blade root and tower base bend load . in high wind speed , the rotor diameter can be decrease to avoid excessive load . the tip blade would extend and retract independently of the pitch mechanism and it would respond to gross change in the wind speed ; the pitch control would still be use to regulate power .

the variable diameter rotor have potential for increase energy production for a give load spectrum . the initial result from the small prototype turbine show that the concept work ; the next step be to develop a full-scale prototype turbine . there be several engineering challenge that must be resolve in order to make a successful and marketable turbine . the challenge include complex control strategy , the need to

maintain a high aerodynamic efficiency , increase blade weight , and general issue with durability and reliability of the system as a whole . @card@ active flow control active flow control ( afc ) be the control of the local airflow surround the blade . the purpose of flow control be often to improve the aerodynamic performance of an airfoil or lifting surface . however , for utility-scale wind turbine the main focus be to reduce extreme load , which occur during high wind activity , and to mitigate fatigue load , which vary along a blade and can occur randomly . to do this , active load control device or " smart " device must include actuator and sensor locate along the span of the blade . the system must be able to sense change in the local flow condition and respond quickly to counter any negative impact on blade loading . this arrangement provide active " smart " control over the rotor . by definition , a smart structure involve distribute actuator and sensor and one or more microprocessor that analyze the response from the sensor and use integrated control theory to command the actuator to apply localized strain / displacement to alter system response . @card@ numerous investigation on the use of afc device show that significant load reduction be possible .

active flow control
flow control be be research for a number of field other than wind energy .

researcher in field such as manned and unmanned airplane , rotorcraft , and gas turbine be all interested in and investigate the potential benefit of active load and flow control . in general , the intent of flow control device be to delay / advance transition , to suppress / enhance turbulence , or to prevent / promote separation . the ensue effect include drag reduction , lift enhancement , mix augmentation , heat transfer enhancement , and flow-induced noise reduction . @card@ however , these effect be not

necessarily mutually exclusive . improve one objective may have adverse effect on other area . the goal be to choose a flow control scheme that achieve an overall beneficial goal with minimal tradeoff .

@card@ flow control methodology
flow control method be categorize similarly to the load control technique explain earlier ; either passive or active . some passive technique include geometric shape to manipulate the pressure gradient , the use of fix mechanical vortex generator for separation control , the addition of a gurney flap at the trail edge , and the placement of longitudinal groove or riblets on a surface to reduce drag . @card@ active control method can be break into two category : predetermine and interactive ( open- or closed-loop ) . a flow chart display flow control methodology be show in fig . @card@ . to demonstrate the difference between the method , the case of constant blow to enhance post-stall lift will be use .

@card@

fig . @card@ flow control methodology diagram . ( source : kral22 )

predetermine control introduce steady or unsteady energy input without concern for the state of flow . therefore , there be no sensor require for this method and the control loop be open . in this situation , the constant blow device would operate

continuously with no regard for the wind speed or pitch angle . in contrast , an interactive control system contain an actuator , a controller , and a sensor . the system can either operate in open- or closed-loop form . open-loop control do not observe the output process that it be control ; therefore , it can not determine if its input have achieve the desire goal . in the example , the constant blow device would be programme to turn on once a set angle of attack be exceed . closed-loop control utilize feedback to compare the actual output with the desire output . a feedback control law be use to drive the actuator or device in order to

@card@

minimize the error between the reference value and the feedback signal . in the example , the blow device would have an additional sensor to detect the onset of flow separation . it would be programme to turn on once flow separation be detect . closed-loop system would be the most beneficial for wind turbine control . the main advantage be energy consumption and safety . predetermine system operate continuously even when the device be not need , thereby use excess energy . openloop system would be more efficient , but at time would still operate unnecessarily . in addition with use excess energy , both of these system could also be detrimental to the system since they do not observe the output . improper control of active device have be show to have serious negative impact on turbine operation and overall safety . by use feedback , the control system can be configure to turn on and shut down the afc system as need .

@card@ flow control category
flow control can be break down into the three separate category : control / sensor , actuator / device , and flow phenomenon . the communication start with the control and sensor , which continuously update the system controller on the flow property and the overall operation . when adjustment be require , the controller command the actuator to activate the flow control device . the device then change their method of operation , alter the local flow phenomenon . the sensor track this change and the cycle repeat . fig . @card@ display the flow control category and list some example relate to wind turbine control . the figure show that tackle a flow control problem require a multidisciplinary approach and research in many area .

@card@ flow control on wind turbine
this report focus on different afc device and actuator , include their associate flow phenomenon . it do not go into detail about the necessary sensor and control , which be critical component of a complete system . although research be be conduct in these area , it be beyond the scope of this report . however , as one

investigate possible device it be important to keep the complete system in mind . fig . @card@ present one possible layout of a control strategy for a complete system . this layout include two type of controller , a master controller and individual blade controller . the master controller would have similar duty to those find in traditional wind turbine control ( manage pitch angle , tip-speed ratio , etc ) , but would also communicate with the blade controller . the blade controller would receive input from the sensor ( local flow condition and / or strain in the blade ) , communicate with the @card@

master controller , and then output command to the afc device locate on the blade . fig . @card@ illustrate trailing-edge device couple with leading-edge sensor . however , as detail later in chapter @card@ , there be several different type and location of afc device .

fig . @card@ control strategy diagram of a complete system .

it be important to remember that the primary purpose of active flow control ( afc ) system on wind turbine be the following : •

to mitigate excessive load ( extreme , fatigue , cyclic , etc . ) cause by variation in the wind .

one foreseeable way to counter excessive load be to supplement current full-span pitch control with afc device . pitching would still be use to optimize energy yield and control aerodynamic torque , while afc device would be able to react quickly to reduce

@card@

the oscillatory , high-frequency load cause by turbulent wind . the operation of afc device also have some potential secondary benefit : 1 ) device may be deploy to increase lift of the blade at low wind speed , allow the turbine to cut-in earlier and capture additional energy . 2 ) on downwind machine , these device could deploy every revolution to counteract the tower wake effect . 3 ) active device could aid in energy capture and load mitigation on turbine that experience high array effect . 4 ) device could be use to prevent tower strike , allow for large diameter rotor to be use and thereby increase energy capture.6 @card@ ) aerodynamic performance enhancement and noise reduction could be realize by maintain laminar flow over the blade . @card@ ) the blade could operate high on the lift curve with the device protect the blade from get into stall .

flow control device
overall , there be fifteen ( @card@ ) device that will be discuss in this report . while these

device have show potential for wind turbine control and merit future research , none of them have mature to a point of be test on full-scale turbine . also , several of the technique have not yet be investigate for wind turbine control . instead , many of the technique have focus on other field such as rotorcraft or unmanned aerial vehicle ( uavs ) . since all of the device function differently , both mechanically and aerodynamically , and be at vary stage of maturity , it be difficult to make direct comparison . the first step in discuss the numerous afc device be to define a label scheme that can be use to classify each concept . a propose four ( @card@ ) layer scheme utilize in the present report be present in table @ord@ the label scheme be derive from a paper on afc for uavs by wood @card@ .

1st layer
the first layer identify the technique as a geometric device ( g ) or a fluidic device ( f ) . geometric device ( g ) move a portion of the external surface , thereby change the section shape and attach the airflow about the airfoil . fluidic device ( f ) actively change the flow about the blade section by either add air into or subtract air from the external flow . there be two device that do not fall into one of these two category . one device , synthetic jet , be classify as a combination of geometric and fluidic ( g / f ) device as it use mechanical motion , which be not in contact with the external airflow , to oscillate a membrane in a cavity inside the airfoil and this , in turn , generate air motion in the external flow . the other device , plasma actuator ( p ) , use an electric field to generate a body force on the surrounding fluid , thus modify its behavior .

@card@

2nd layer
the second layer describe the location of the device , such as near the lead edge ( le ) , near the trail edge ( te ) , or mid-chord ( mc ) .

3rd layer
the third layer describe how the device adjust the lift curve . investigation of the afc device show that the lift curve of an airfoil be affect in one of two way . first , the device shift the entire lift curve up or down , which be do by effectively change the camber of the airfoil . this be label as increase lift ( i ) or decrease lift ( d ) . many device be capable of shift the lift curve both up and down ; those be label ( i / d ) . second , the device extend the lift curve of the airfoil to stall at a high angle of attack , this be label delay stall ( ds ) . fig . @card@ display the two different way that the lift curve can be adjust .

description of modified blade with ds device
to successfully mitigate load , the device must be able to decrease the generate lift . at first observation , delay stall ( ds ) only increase lift at high angle of attack as show in fig . 3-1a . this do not decrease lift ; therefore , ds device would not be consider as an option for load alleviation . although they could contribute to some of the secondary benefit list in section @card@ . however , an idea present by corten @card@ provide an alternative method of use ds device to reduce turbine load . the common application of ds device ( in this example , passive vortex generator ) be to add them onto an existing design to increase clmax and delay stall . corten ' S idea be to redesign blade so that the maximum fig . sectional lift of a blade with
@card@ airfoil with comparable lift generation . @card@ a ds device equal that of ( source : corten )

the original blade without a ds device . fig . @card@ demonstrate the difference in chord length between the redesign , or modify , blade and the original blade . the idea can be more easily explain by analyze the lift equation :

@card@ lmax = c l max ⋅ ⋅ ρ ⋅ v @card@ ⋅ c @card@

( eqn . 3 )

where ρ be the air density , v be the air velocity over the blade , c be the chord length , and clmax be the maximum lift coefficient . if clmax be increase by a ds device , then the chord , c , could be reduce a comparable amount so that the generate lift still equal that of the original blade . the outcome of this redesign be illustrate in fig . @card@ . the maximum sectional lift , lmax , of the original blade and the modified blade be equal ;

@card@

however , the slope ( δl / δα ) have be decrease . the benefit of reduce the slope be explain below and illustrate in fig . @card@ .

fig . @card@ comparison of modified blade with the same chord and same lift . ( source : corten24 )

fig . @card@ diagram of benefit use modified blade with ds device . ( source : corten24 )

@card@

the oscillate load on a turbine be cause by sudden change in lift see by the blade . these change in lift can be cause by a number of event , one of them be turbulence . turbulence can increase / decrease the wind velocity , v , increase / decrease the angle of attack , α , see by a rotate turbine blade , or it can do both . therefore , to reduce these oscillate load , the sudden change in lift have to be mitigate . this can be accomplish by reduce the lift curve slope ( δl / δα ) . the reduce slope do three thing that help to reduce the load . one , the lift variation ( δl ) for a give δα be reduce . two , the maximum lift for a give δα be lower . three , the magnitude of the maximum negative lift be reduce . this reduction be important during emergency shutdown for pitch-to-feather machine . as the blade pitch rapidly , they pass into negative angle of attack during which the rotor can experience high load . corten ' s

research indicate a potential reduction of @card@ % for lift variation , a potential reduction of @card@ % for extreme lift , and a potential reduction of @card@ % for maximum negative lift . the primary benefit of modify blade with ds device be to decrease oscillate load . secondary benefit be associate with the reduce chord , allow for small blade and , thus require less material . 4th layer the fourth and final layer differentiate between a steady ( s ) and unsteady ( u ) device ( i.e. . a device whose position vary with time about a nominal setting ) . for example , a trailing-edge flap system , although it could be in continual motion , be simply change position to create a series of steady state condition and be therefore consider to be a steady device . the motion itself be not use to create an aerodynamic control force , as be the case of , i.e. . , pulse vortex generating jet . most of the device that operate unsteadily @card@

be also capable of steady operation ; therefore , these device be label ( s / u ) . however , research into these device have show that unsteady , or pulse , operation be usually more effective .

table @card@ classification chart use to label each afc device .

table @card@ show all fifteen device that will be discuss . to more easily present the various afc device , the discussion on each device be break into four section . the section be as follow : 1 ) description - introduce the device and describe how it work , both mechanically and aerodynamically . 2 ) classification - explain the classification for the device . 3 ) background - present a history of the research , include some result and the present state of the device . 4 ) wind turbine control - discuss the potential each device have for the wind energy industry , include its advantage and disadvantage and the hurdle that the technology face .

@card@

commonality of afc device the purpose and potential benefit of afc device have be explain , but how they operate have not . although each device operate differently , there be certain

characteristic that be require for a device to be successful . • it must be small in size so that a number of device can be distribute along a portion of the span to provide sectional flow control at different location of the turbine blade . this also mean the device should be scalable , mean it can be effective across a range of chord length . • the device must have a fast activation speed . this be necessary to counter the high frequency oscillatory load and to provide proper aeroelastic control . • the activation force and power requirement must be low so that the energy to operate the afc system be low than or equal to the additional energy gain from the turbine . this allow for the secondary benefit of improve energy capture . • the afc system need to be reliable and dependable . the turbine should be able to maintain operation if one or more afc device fail . • it be necessary for the device to be durable and robust in order to withstand the harsh environment see by turbine . basically , the addition of a flow control system should not drastically increase maintenance cost . the lifetime of the system also should be similar to the lifetime of the turbine and its component . • the integration of the afc system into a turbine blade need to be take into consideration from both a manufacturing and maintenance point of view . current blade manufacturing technique should still be use ; if a device fail , it should be easily replaceable in an inexpensive and straightforward manner .

@card@

•

in the end , the drive factor for the success or failure of an afc system be economics . a successful system must be able to reduce the cost of energy for wind turbine .

all of the afc device will face certain challenge that will have to be overcome before any degree of implementation can be reach on commercial wind turbine . since the vast majority of actuator and sensor will have to be place on or within the turbine blade , substantial modification to the blade will be require . this will add complexity to the entire system and require a more sophisticated control system that would be capable of properly operate the afc device . research on several device have indicate that improper control of afc device could have a detrimental effect on the performance and safety of a wind turbine .

@card@

likewise , a flap deflection in the opposing direction twist the blade toward the suction surface , thereby increase the angle of attack and , hence , the load on the blade .

nontraditional flap operate on the same principle as traditional flap , to change the sectional camber by deflect the trailing-edge portion of the airfoil . however , the use " smart " material ( in these concept : linear and bend piezoelectric actuator , and compliant structure ) make these device aerodynamically superior to the traditional flap . this be due to minimal drag production over a wide lift range . traditional flap tend to produce flow separation and increase drag during deployment . promising result have be show in numerical study , wind-tunnel experiment , and also in mechanical design . additional research to continue development of

nontraditional flap must address many criterion include the require aerodynamic shape , the required stiffness and dynamic response , and the weight and power require to actuate the control surface.32 although these " smart " material offer many advantage , they often come with their own set of problem . inherent drawback of these concept include scalability to large model and the durability and reliability of the deployment device ( both piezoelectric and compliant structure ) . long-term use be a concern because creep or degradation of these material can occur , which would drastically limit their performance . a highvoltage electric power supply would be require to activate the piezoelectric material base actuator .

the initial development of the microtab concept be conduct by researcher at uc davis in the late 1990s.46-48 both computational and experimental study on low surface microtabs on the gu25-5 ( @card@ ) @card@ airfoil @card@ be perform in 2-d and 3-d operation . the effect of tab height , tab location and tab spacing be all investigate for 3-d application . the result indicate that a tab of @card@ % c in height , locate at x / c = @card@ % on the low surface provide the good compromise for lift , drag , and volume constraints.46 for both numerical and experimental test , a @card@ % increase in cl be see in the linear lift region with @card@ % c tabs.46 standish and van dam @card@ and van dam , standish , and baker @card@ conduct more comprehensive 2-d computational experiment further examine tab height and location on both upper and low surface on the s809 and the gu25-5 ( @card@ ) @card@ airfoil . pressure surface tab demonstrate an increase in lift over all angle of attack , whereas suction surface tab only decrease lift at angle of attack throughout the linear region . the suction surface tab lose effectiveness at the high angle of attack because the flow separate forward of the tab location . the optimal location for the low surface tab in term of lift and drag be again find to be around @card@ % c with a height on the order of the boundary layer thickness , or ~ @card@ % c . the computational study be validate in the

fig . @card@ comparison between experimental and computational result for low surface tab on the baseline s809 airfoil with a re = @card@ × @card@ . ( source : baker et al.52 )

although early report on 3-d investigation indicate that solid tab generate the good lift enhancement , gap may be necessary for actuation purpose and for some pitch moment and drag reduction benefit . @card@ , @card@ mayda , van dam , and yen-nakafuji @card@ perform more detailed computational investigation on the 3-d effect of microtabs by model finite width tab on a semi-infinite wing . study show that tab effectiveness reduce as the gap size be increase . the amount of gap can be identify with a solidity ratio , sr , define as ; sr = span cover by tab total span of model
( eqn . 5 )

computational result indicate that a solidity ratio of @card@ % or higher should be maintain for proper effectiveness . a solidity ratio low than @card@ % allow the flow to reattach at the trail edge , thereby drastically reduce the tab ' S performance .

@card@

in order to fully understand the behavior of these device , chow and van dam @card@ , @card@ conduct computational study analyze the unsteady behavior and potential nonlinearites during the deployment of a pressure surface microtab integrate into a s809 airfoil . for analysis purpose , a non-dimensional deployment time , tdeployment , be use to study the tab ' S motion . tdeployment = u ∞ ⋅ t deployment c
( eqn . @card@ )

where u∞ be the free-stream velocity ( m / S ) , tdeployment be the actual deployment time ( S ) , and c be the chord length ( m ) . the transient flow behavior for tdeployment = @card@ can be see in fig . @card@ and fig . @card@ . as the tab deploy , a low-pressure region and a counterclockwise vortex form just aft of the tab . up until a non-dimensional deployment time of t = @card@ ( fig . @card@ / 15f ) , the emergent tab-generated vortex act like a separation bubble . as the bubble extend past the trail edge , an interesting phenomenon occur ; the suction surface flow at the trail edge be entrain back into the pressure surface vortex . fig . @card@ / 15g show the suction surface flow be draw around the trail edge and back towards the tab . the flow continue travel on the pressure surface , drive by the vortex , and up the aft part of the tab until it reconnect with the pressure surface flow from upstream of the tab . a new stagnation point be form at the tip of the tab , where the two flow leave the airfoil / tab surface ( fig . @card@ / 15h ) . the shift of the separation point from the trail edge to the end of the tab change the kutta condition of the airfoil . in this situation , the effective camber be increase and cl be increase . the result from the computational study on the dynamic behavior of tab show that only small transient effect be see during deployment ; therefore , these device can be design and operate as simple " on54

off " device . this allow for the use of more simple control strategy and actuation mechanism . the late wind-tunnel experiment investigate the microtab concept be conduct on a blade tip model . @card@ the half-scale model ( model span of @card@ in . ) be representative of the outboard @card@ % of the ers-100 horizontal-axis turbine blade . this experiment be the first test of the microtab ' s performance in a fully three-dimensional flowfield . tab height of @card@ % and @card@ % chord be investigate under free and fix transition at reynolds number of @card@ , @card@ and @card@ , @ord@ the test use static , singlepiece ( non-segmented ) tab run the span of the model locate at @card@ % c on the pressure surface and at @card@ % c on the suction surface . the microtabs show similar effectiveness as see in the two-dimensional tests.58 nearly constant lift increase of @card@ % and @card@ % be achieve with lower ( pressure ) surface @card@ % c and @card@ % c tab , respectively . lift reduction in the linear lift regime of @card@ % and @card@ % be see for upper ( suction ) surface @card@ % c and @card@ % c tab , respectively . these result confirm that tab be effective in fully three-dimensional flowfields , a crucial step towards potential full-scale application .

further research have be conduct on the effectiveness of tab use aeroelastic simulation in conjunction with a simple control program . for this analysis ,

that the blade root fatigue damage be increase as a result of tab deployment . deployment of the microtab system at other time be also simulate and show an increase in load and deflection . improper control be a concern for all afc device .

the microtab system consist of small device that be capable of create change in lift comparable to the change create by much large flap . appealing feature include small size , fast activation , mechanical simplicity of the design , low power requirement and a short linear deployment distance . the perpendicular motion of the tab relative to the flow require significantly small force for a give change in sectional lift compare to a traditional trailing-edge flap . the major hurdle face this concept be minimize air leakage between the tab and the blade . substantial leakage would

generate aeroacoustic noise and negatively affect the turbine ' S performance . the far aft location of the tab make it challenging to install an actuator near the tab . for this reason , an appropriate design would include a lever arm connect the tab to an electromechanical actuator place near @card@ % c . if a motor and lever arm configuration be to be implement , measure to reduce possible misalignment would have to be take .

the mite have similar advantage to the microtabs ; they be small , require little activation force , and can respond quickly . the upside to this type of flap be that the far aft location provide more effective lift control and there be no need for slot in the blade construction , which reduce the modification to the blade . however , the tradeoff be that a blunt trail edge be mandatory . this will decrease performance of the turbine when the device be not active and research have show blunt trail edge generate noise in the tip region . @card@

fix vortex generator have be extensively research and implement on wind turbine , but not for active load control application , rather they be typically install near the root of the blade to mitigate inboard flow separation . however , active vgs could be place in the outboard region of the blade and be use for control purpose by increase clmax and αstall only when necessary . the implementation of active vgs would require actuator and slot in the blade . similar to other afc device , the requirement for slot in the surface of the turbine blade raise concern about possible reduce performance and noise generation . the forward placement of the vgs be advantageous because there be plenty of space to house an actuation system within a turbine blade . the main disadvantage of active vgs and the other ds device be that they only be capable of delay stall . delay stall be not as desirable for control purpose as adjust the entire lift curve as the i / d device be able to do . one possible solution be to take corten ' s24 idea ( describe in the introduction of chapter @card@ ) of passively apply vgs to wind turbine blade one step further and utilize actively control vgs , similar to the research conduct by Barrett and farokhi70 . however , in this configuration the vgs would be normally deploy instead of normally retract . the vgs could then retract in certain situation to reduce clmax and minimize load ; the downside of use normally deploy vgs be that they increase drag at attach flow condition . one advantage of this be to use design blade with short chord , this could save weight and cost on material . this idea could possibly be apply to other ds device discuss throughout this report .

@card@ blow and suction
@card@ description

conventional blow and suction technique delay stall by add high-momentum air into the boundary layer . blow device add store high-momentum air through slot in the aerodynamic surface . suction device remove low-momentum fluid near the surface , which deflect high-momentum free-stream fluid towards the surface , thus reenergizing the boundary layer . @card@ the introduction of high-momentum air , from either blow or suction , into the boundary layer assist in overcome adverse pressure gradient , postpone separation . the blow / suction slot can be locate near the lead edge and / or near the trail edge as show in fig . @card@ . the slot be normally position in a near uniform fashion along the span of the blade and the blow / suction can occur steadily or unsteadily . the presence of the slot can change the effective shape of the airfoil at high angle of attack , cause an increase in drag ; however , at low angle of attack this be generally not an issue .

freestream velocity , and aref be the planform area . physically , this coefficient represent the ratio of slot momentum to free-stream momentum . pulse operation be also possible . pulse blow send short pulse rather than a continuous jet of fluid into the boundary layer and have be find to be more effective . the improve effectiveness be believe to come from the production of vorticity inside the boundary layer . this additional vorticity transport additional free-stream momentum into the boundary layer , therefore require less momentum to be inject through the slot itself . the reduce force frequency , f+ , be commonly use to characterize the ratio between the actuator force frequency and the frequency at which fluid event will be convected down the blade surface by the freestream flow . @card@

the application of blow for flow control on rotor have a long history with the first flight test occur in @card@ on a cessna ch-1 helicopter . @card@ recent experiment by Seifert , daraby , nishri , and wygnanski @card@ compare steady and pulse blow leadingedge slot show that pulse blow be more effective . a naca @card@ airfoil equip with a leading-edge slot be test for reynolds number between @card@ , @card@ and @card@ , @ord@ the experiment show that pure pulse blow from the lead edge at a very low momentum coefficient , cμ = @card@ , and at a reduce forcing frequency , f+ = @card@ , increase the lift coefficient at α = @card@ ° by @card@ % relative to the non-blowing case . the steady blow case with the same momentum coefficient do not show any effect . research conduct by weaver , mcalister , and Tso @card@ look at the benefit of use steady and pulse blow to improve the dynamic stall characteristic of the airfoil . the boeing-vertol vr-7 airfoil ( use on helicopter rotor ) equip with an upper surface blow slot be use . the airfoil have a chord of @card@ in . , a slot span of @card@ in . , and a slot height of @card@ in . the airfoil be test in a water tunnel with a reynolds number of @card@ , @card@ and undergo sinusoidal pitch oscillation describe by

( eqn . @card@ )

where α be the angle of attack , αm be the mean angle of attack , ω be the frequency of pitch oscillation , and t be time .

@card@

the experiment investigate αm value of @card@ ° and @card@ ° at reduce airfoil frequency , k , from @card@ to @card@ ( ω be relate to the reduce airfoil frequency through eqn . 4 ) . the reduce force frequency , f+ , range from @card@ to @card@ and the momentum coefficient , cμ , range from @card@ to @card@ . unsteady lift , drag , and pitching-moment load be measure , and fluorescent dye be use to visualize the flow . the result show that steady , upper-surface blow trap a separation bubble near the lead edge during a portion of the airfoil ' s upward rotation . the presence of the separation bubble be attribute to significantly enhance the lift . the large change in cl be obtain at the low reduce airfoil frequency , the low mean angle of attack , and the high value of cμ . the performance decrease as the reduce frequency and mean angle of oscillation increase . pulse blow show similar effectiveness and offer the large

improvement at f+ = @card@ . under certain condition , both blow type increase the clmax ; pulse blow increase it by @card@ % and steady blow by @card@ % .

although these technique have be successfully implement on aircraft , there be many concern relate to wind turbine application . the conventional design , use slot and store high-momentum air , would be difficult to implement on turbine blade . main concern would be add weight and complexity of spanwise slot and the need for compressed air storage . much of the research regard conventional blow and suction be now outdated ; however , past study have pave the way for the development of other unconventional device that use the same fundamental approach . these device would be more appealing for turbine control and many of them be discuss later .

recent study have focus on the potential benefit of ccw on wind turbine blade . tongchitpakdee , benjanirat , and sankar78 perform computational study evaluate the performance of circulation control on the nrel phase vi rotor , which have s809 blade profile . the nrel phase vi rotor , a stall-controlled hawt , have be successfully test in the wind tunnel and use in the past as a validation tool for a number of numerical study . prior to model circulation control , the flow solver be validate for the baseline case with the nrel rotor experimental database89-92 . calculation be perform for the nrel phase vi rotor at two wind speed , @card@ and @card@ m / S , and three yaw angle , @card@ ° , @card@ ° , and @card@ ° . the jet momentum coefficient ( eqn . @card@ ) range from @card@ to @card@ .

fig . @card@ display the change in the flow field , at a low wind speed of @card@ m / S , as the jet momentum coefficient be increase , thus increase circulation about the airfoil . the result deflection of the streamline near the trail edge can be observe in the figure . @card@

the jet remain attach to the curve trail edge , thereby improve the suction on the trailing-edge suction surface . the front stagnation point also be affect ; as cμ increase , the stagnation point move further back on the pressure surface , and substantial turn of the flow outside of the boundary layer be observe . at @card@ m / S , the flow be well behave and fully attach over the blade , allow the ccw to be effective . test at the high wind speed of @card@ m / S do not prove as effective due to flow separation forward of the jet . liu84 evaluate the possibility of install a second jet near the lead edge to prevent lead edge stall . he find that the combination of a blow jet and a ccw could suppress 2-d airfoil stall and improve the effectiveness of the ccw at high angle of attack .
@card@ wind turbine control

much of the research on ccw be be conduct to produce large value of lift and therefore induce a large loading to create more power . this strategy be not beneficial for load reduction . however , circulation control may potentially mitigate excessive load if control properly or the device could be install on the pressure surface of the airfoil . one major drawback of this system be the need to install air duct run the length of the turbine blade to supply the jet with high-pressure air . a second drawback be the required rounded shape of the trail edge , which result in increase drag and aeroacoustic noise due to vorticity shedding .

@card@ plasma actuator
@card@ description

surface non-thermal plasma actuator operate by create an electric field between two electrode , an anode ( + ) and a cathode ( - ) . by apply a large voltage difference between the electrode , an electric field be form and induce an " electric wind " , or " ionic wind " , close to the surface . the electric wind be form by collision between drift ion and the neutral particle in the electrode gap region @card@ . the induce wind act as a body force and drive the nearby fluid , create a zero-net mass flux ( znmf ) jet , modify the boundary-layer airflow profile and postpone separation . the behavior of the actuator be dependent on geometrical parameter ( electrode shape and size , gap distance , etc ) , electrical parameter ( voltage , waveform and frequency if ac , etc ) , ambient air property ( temperature , pressure , humidity , wind speed , etc ) , and the nature of the dielectric wall.91-9394 today , there be many different configuration that be classify as plasma actuator . new device or different configuration be research and develop every year . four configuration will briefly be discuss to develop a conceptual understanding of plasma actuator dynamics . the device be @card@ ) dc surface corona discharge , 2 ) ac surface dielectric barrier discharge , @card@ ) slide discharge , and 4 ) wall jet . the description of these device be discuss in further detail by Moreau , Benard , jolibois , and touchard @card@ . the dc surface corona discharge actuator consist of two wire electrode mount flush on the surface of a dielectric profile ( fig . 3-30a ) . when a high dc voltage ( > @card@ kv ) be apply , a corona be form around the small diameter wire ( usually the anode ) and an electric wind be create tangential to the surface between the two electrode . the

@card@

electric wind be capable of modify the boundary-layer airflow profile . fig . 3-30b display a visualization of a low velocity airflow along a flat plate . if the actuator be off , the smoke remain horizontal . when the actuator be active , flow above the anode be entrain towards the surface from the outer layer , cause the smoke to be draw to the surface and then accelerate in the discharge region . the advantage of this device be that it require a simple power supply , however the design be limit to an electric wind velocity of only a few m / S .

fig . @card@ a ) schematic side view of the dc corona discharge actuator , b ) 2d visualization of manipulate airflow along a flat plate . ( source : Moreau et al.93 )

the ac dielectric barrier discharge ( dbd ) be compose of two flat electrode mount on both side of a dielectric material . one be ground and the other be connect to a high ac voltage ( several kv ) with a frequency between @card@ hz and several khz . a plasma sheet of blue ionize air be visible on the upper side of the dielectric as it extend between the two electrode as show in fig . @card@ . it look like a quasi-uniform glow , but in fact it be constitute of micro discharge distribute uniformly in time and space along the electrode length . the electrical power consumption be slightly more than the dc surface corona , but a high electric wind velocity be generate and this can exert strong effect on the local flow condition .

the slide discharge actuator be capable of generate a stable plasma sheet . it be first use for airflow application by Roth and Sherman @card@ . as show in fig . 3-32a , it use three plane electrode ; two be flush mount on the wall surface of a dielectric and expose to the air ( # @card@ and # @card@ ) and the other ( # @card@ ) be on the opposite side of the dielectric . electrode # @card@ and # @card@ be connect together and usually ground while electrode # @card@ be excite . if a voltage with appropriate ac and dc component be apply to electrode # @card@ , a plasma sheet be form as show in fig . @card@ .

the plasma wall jet or plasma synthetic jet be introduce by jukes , Choi , Johnson , and Scott @card@ in @card@ and be illustrate in fig . 3-33a . this device use two air exposed surface electrode and one covered electrode to create two separate surface dielectric barrier discharge . if electrode # @card@ and # @card@ be excite by the same high voltage , a plasma jet perpendicular to the surface be create . if the electrode be excite by two different voltage , the angle of the jet be modify . for example , if vac1 > vac2 , the jet be deflect to the right ( fig . @card@ ) . this configuration be different from to the other plasma @card@

actuation device ; instead of generate a plasma region parallel to the wall it create a vertical wall jet that penetrate into the boundary layer . the wall jet be able to generate vortex in the boundary layer , which improve the effectiveness of the device by increase the mix between the free-stream flow and boundary layer flow . another important feature of the plasma synthetic jet actuator be that it can easily be reverse to act as a suction or blow device . recent study have analyze the performance of different electrode configuration , include pulse operation . @card@ , @card@

Moreau et al.91 bring up the concern that past experiment could not explain if the delayed stall be due to the plasma actuator add momentum into the boundary layer or be due to the laminar to turbulent transition induce by the presence of the actuator cause the boundary layer to trip . they show that the plasma actuator be , in fact , capable of prevent flow separation and promote flow reattachment . this work also show that actuator be most effective when place near the separation point , similar to vortex generator and other flow separation mitigation device . jolibois , forte , and Moreau @card@ also investigate the optimal location for plasma actuator . the study involve seven independent dbd plasma actuator mount on the suction side of a @card@ m chord naca @card@ airfoil . to prevent uncertainty about the flow transitioning due to the physical presence of the actuator , the researcher trip the flow at the lead edge with a turbulator . flow visualization and piv measurement be record to further understand the physical effect of each actuator . this study conclude

@card@

that the optimum location for effectiveness and efficiency be at the separation point . however , this be difficult to achieve , as the natural separation point of an airfoil will change as a function of the angle of attack and reynolds number . fig . @card@ illustrate the streamline of the time-averaged airflow over an airfoil at

plasma actuator have receive considerable attention over the recent year as a practical flow control device due to their advantage over fluidic and mechanical device . they be able to directly convert electrical energy into kinetic energy , which be use to modify the airflow . they have advantage over mechanical device ; the device be simple , lightweight and use no move part ; therefore , it be likely not be a source of vibration or noise . unlike fluidic device , plasma actuator do not require a source of high89

momentum air . therefore , compressed air storage and plumbing run the length of a turbine blade be not need . research have also show that the presence of the electrode do not interfere with the surrounding airflow when inactive and major modification to the turbine blade be not require for installation . another feature be that plasma actuator can be design to operate in co-flow and counter-flow condition , which allow for more option when control localized flow . the primary disadvantage be maintain a stable plasma region , low efficiency and the requirement of high voltage line run inside the turbine blade . under certain condition and configuration , maintain a stable electric wind can be difficult . plasma device have reduce performance in high wind speed . in fact , studies91 indicate that the performance be quite low at a wind speed of @card@ m / S , whereas other afc device have prove effective at wind speed above @card@ m / S . this be one area that advancement in plasma actuator need to be make . another area for improvement be the energy conversion efficiency . the energy conversion from electrical to kinetic energy have a low efficiency ( a few percent91 ) ; a large part of the electrical power go into gas heating rather than direct gas motion .

the result show promise for himvgs as a mean of active flow control . as a first step towards turbine control application , computational and experimental study should be conduct on wind turbine airfoil and flow condition to ensure the technology will be effective . the advantage of use these device rather than fluidic device be that there be no need for a compressed air system . this simplify the overall design , ease

implementation , and reduce system weight . the location of the device be advantageous because there be plenty of space inside the blade to house the actuation system . the total system would require minimal power since the compliant structure allow for a small force and a short actuation distance . concern with this design be similar to those for the microtab , in that tight tolerance be require . when the device be inactive , gap between the blade and the himvg could create noise and reduce performance , especially since the device be locate near to the lead edge . degradation of the compliant structure over time may also be of concern .

physical change in the camber be use to generate vortex locate near mid chord increase lift only modest improvement be see in steady operation , unsteady operation be more effective

@card@ background

the first experiment with the shape change airfoil be conduct by pinkerton and moses @card@ in @ord@ their objective be to assess the ability of a new piezoelectric actuator to alter the upper surface geometry of a subscale airfoil . the piezoelectric actuator , call thunder43 , be develop by nasa and be capable of large bend displacement ( several mm. ) than previous piezoelectric actuator . the goal be to use thunder to change the airfoil ' S camber , which , in turn , would adjust the local flow field around the airfoil to increase maximum lift and delay stall . the study focus on the feasibility of the actuator rather than aerodynamic performance . research in @card@ expand upon the concept and look into the aerodynamics and optimal control strategy . a modular test section be build use the base profile of a naca @card@ and the actuation system as describe previously in section @card@ . munday and jacob147 analyze the effect of static shape change ( the actuator remain stationary at a number of pre-determined position ) by collect force and piv measurement . they conclude that only modest improvement in l / d can be achieve @card@

with static actuator position . maximum actuator displacement slightly increase both lift and drag and increased l / d by @card@ % . pern @card@ investigate a circular-arc airfoil and show that an airfoil with an oscillate , rather than a fix , camber setting would produce high lift coefficient . this improve performance be due to vortex generation ; the oscillate motion create a series of vortex that add momentum and entrain the flow above the boundary layer towards the surface . the boundary-layer thickness downstream of the vortex source be drastically reduce because the flow be energize and remain attach , despite the adverse pressure gradient . if only one vortex be create , the flow would lose quickly momentum and separate due to the adverse pressure gradient . by oscillate the upper surface , vortex be continually generate and travel downstream , add to the energy of the flow and overcome the adverse pressure gradient . @card@ additional experiments149 evaluate the performance of a naca @card@ airfoil equip with the shape change system by measure the separated flow thickness at @card@ % c use smoke-wire flow visualization . researcher conduct a series of low-speed wind tunnel test at re = @card@ × @card@ and @card@ × @card@ , angle of attack of @card@ ° , @card@ ° , @card@ ° and @card@ ° , and at reduce frequency f+ ( eqn . @card@ ) range from @card@ to @ord@ flow visualization show that the uncontrolled airfoil experience large separation ; however , oscillate the curvature of the upper surface reduce flow separation . oscillate the surface with a small

@card@ wind turbine control

this concept have show promise in both computational and experimental study . the shape change airfoil have a smooth deployment area , give it an advantage over other method which require hole or slot in the exterior skin of the airfoil . there would be minimal problem associate with noise generation and reduction in performance due to soil . the great hurdle of this concept be that the piezoelectric material cover a large portion of the chord . this could be problematic with implementation on full-sized blade and could have detrimental effect on the overall structural integrity . difficulty with

@card@

use deform piezoelectric actuator can also arise from the requirement for a highvoltage source and reduce performance over time due to creep .

@card@ device summary
active flow control be a rapidly grow field and with numerous device be investigate . it be impossible to list all of the device that could be use for future wind turbine control ; however , this report attempt to introduce some of the most promising device . overall , fifteen ( @card@ ) potentially useful device be discuss . a description of how the device work , both aerodynamically and mechanically , be present . a classification system be create to help separate the device and a brief research background on each device be include . comparison between each device be difficult to make because they be all at vary stage of research and be apply to different field . however , their advantage and disadvantage relate to possible wind turbine control be discuss . the main characteristic that separate the device into two class be how they adjust the lift curve ; either by delay stall ( ds ) or by shift the curve up or down ( i / d ) . since wind turbine normally operate in the linear region of the lift curve , the device that have the most promise for load alleviation be i / d device . however it be show that ds device could still be use . investigation into the afc device have show that there be substantial potential for the improvement of wind turbine control . the purpose of this report be not to directly compare device or recommend the most viable device for turbine control ; instead it be mean to provide the reader with a global view of today ' S research that could make significant contribution to wind turbine control in the future . as research progress , specific flow control device will begin to

@card@

stand out as viable option for load control . of course , the true test of an afc device will be a field demonstration on a large-scale wind turbine . at this time , field test be many year away and more research be need before this can be achieve .

conclusion
the wind industry be rapidly grow and sign indicate that it will remain this way

for year to come . as the industry have grow , so have the size of the turbine . significant growth have make it impossible to control turbine passively as they be control in the past ; therefore , modern turbine rely on sophisticated control system to assure safe and optimal operation under a variety of atmospheric condition . as the rotor continue to grow in size , the industry need to make yet another shift in their approach to turbine control by consider localized flow control along the blade . large rotor experience more pronounced structural and fatigue loading , particularly in turbulent wind . this loading can have a detrimental effect on the rotor and surround component and can lead to an increase in o & m and a decrease in turbine life . implement new load control technique could decrease excessive load , which be key factor in turbine life . the afc device introduce in this report be possible solution to these issue . these device be small , lightweight , and can actuate at speed that can counter the loading from turbulent wind . improve control could lead to increase turbine life , reduce required material , improve energy capture , well overall performance , and reduce Coe of wind energy . lower Coe ensure competitive price against traditional and other renewable energy source and the continued maturation of the industry .

select your site the information in this section give specific about the ideal sit of the wind turbine tower , if your area do not have an ideal location , find the good location possible . remember correct sit will increase both efficiency and safety . small increase in average wind speed result in dramatic increase in energy output of the wind generator . for example , an increase in wind speed of @card@ % ( @card@ mph - @card@ mph ; @card@ m / s - @card@ m / s ) result in approximately a @card@ % increase in the power available from the wind . therefore , the good the location the well the performance . as a rule , the wind generator should be mount as high and as far away from obstruction as possible . this will create a clear wind channel . two basic requirement for a good wind generator site : • good average wind speed • low wind turbulence the low the turbulence , the less stress your wind generator will sustain , the longer it will last and the more energy it will produce . turbulence be create by obstruction . keep the following in mind when consider site : • a tower immediately downwind of a building should be at least @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) above the height of the building . • the tower should be @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) high than any barrier within a @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) radius . wind speed your wind generator will produce energy when there be wind . a photovoltaic ( pv ) solar panel will produce energy when the solar be plentiful . this be typical of seasonal change . when it be sunny it be calm ; when it be cloudy it be windy . for your wind generator to produce energy , average wind speed at your site should be at least 6mph : @card@ mile / hour = @card@ meter / second . if wind in your area be less than @card@ mph , you might look to install a photovoltaic ( pv ) system next to your wind generator create a hybrid renewable energy system . topography if your location be basically flat , topography be not in issue when decide where to place your wind generator . there be circumstance where the high land available may not be the good place for your wind generator . high land nearby may be awkward to get to , may be too far away from where you need the power , or may expose your wind generator to potentially damaging turbulent condition . time spend consider topography be vital prior to installation . barrier barrier ( building , tree , etc . that impede flow of wind ) produce wake that may extend far downwind of the barrier and to a height considerably above the barrier . these wake be area of decrease wind speed and can cause potentially damaging turbulence . barrier near the wind generator will affect its performance . tower base & earth anchor layout remember your wind turbine tower kit should be install by two people . tower layout the tower be assemble on the ground , then and only then , tilt into position . the tower base support the tower on the ground , and serve as the pivot point to raise and lower the tower . two set of guy wire ( an upper and lower set with four wire per set ) secure the tower vertically : • the upper set of guy wire secure the tower at a height of approximately @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) . • the low set of guy wire secure the tower at a height of approximately @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) . four arrowhead earth anchor ( locate approximately @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) from the tower base at @card@ ° interval ) secure the guy wire to the ground . one upper guy wire and one low guy wire attach to each earth anchor . tower assembly - hillside if possible , position the tower to tilt along the incline of the hill , with the top of the tower uphill from the tower base . this will add to the stability of the tower . tower base @ord@ locate the area where you will install the tower . place the tower base on the ground and orientate in the direction the tower will be tilt towards . @ord@ have one person stand at the tower base hold a measure tape . @ord@ the second person take the measure tape end and walk out @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) and in a circle around the tower base . • make sure there be no obstruction along the circumference .

• make sure there be sufficient room to tilt the tower into position and install the wind generator . @ord@ drive the four tower base earth spike into the ground toward the center of the base , as illustrate below .

arrowhead earth anchor @ord@ position the first earth anchor on the ground along the tower tilt axis , @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) from the tower base . @ord@ place the second earth anchor along the tower tilt axis , @card@ ' ft ( 4.6m ) from the tower base in the opposite direction . • with the tower base in the center , ( @card@ place ) @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) the first and second earth anchor should form a straight line @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) along the tower tilt axis . @ord@ place the third earth anchor @card@ ft ( @card@ ) from the tower base . @ord@ place the fourth earth anchor @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) from the tower base . • with the tower base in the center , the third and fourth earth anchor should form a line perpendicular to the line form by the first two earth anchor @ord@ check the position of the earth anchor to ensure that they be within approximately @card@ in ( @card@ cm ) of their ideal position . • each earth anchor should be @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) from the tower base . @ord@ insert the beveled end of the earth anchor drive rod into the arrowhead earth anchor , as illustrate below . @ord@ drive the earth anchor up with force . you will notice the earth anchor pull out of the ground into the ground use the slightly . this will lock the earth anchor in the ground . earth anchor drive rod and a @card@ kg hammer .

note : no more than @card@ " inch ( @card@ cm ) of earth anchor cable should be out of the ground once it have be lock into place . • notice the angle at which the earth anchor be be drive . this angle be important for maximum pull strength . the angle should be in line with the angle of the guy wire ( i.e. . the angle should be point towards the tower base ) . important : earth anchor must be install in soil that have be undisturbed . @ord@ drive the earth anchor into the ground until @card@ " inch ( @card@ cm ) of cable remain above ground .

@ord@ then , insert the earth anchor drive rod through the cable eye and pull . @ord@ finish install the remain three earth anchor as describe above .

important : although the earth anchor be design to break through small rock , if there be a rock or obstruction that be too large , remove and relocate the anchor . the depth of the anchor be critical to its effectiveness . tower assembly the tower be assemble in several easy step . if this be a permanent installation , first dig a trench from the base of the tower , to where the battery be house . this will assist in the lay of wire from your turbine to battery bank . tower tube layout @ord@ lay out the six tower tube on the ground as show . leave approximately @card@ " inch ( @card@ cm ) between each tube .

@ord@ with the tube lay out as show on the preceding page , slide the guy wire attachment plate over the corresponding tower tube . • slide the @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) guy wire attachment plate over the top tower tube . • slide the @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) guy wire attachment plate over the fourth tower tube from the bottom .

@ord@ align the guy wire attachment plate so that each guy wire be in line with the anchor . @ord@ with all guy wire attachment plate in position , electrical wire can be run through the tower tube . leave sufficient wire protrude at the top of the tower to connect the wind generator . • electrical wire can also be pull through with a wire snake , after the tower tube be assemble . @ord@ join the tower tube together use a soft-faced mallet or hammer . use a piece of wood between the tube and the mallet to protect the end of the tube .

• the expanded end of the tube prevent the guy wire attachment plate from slide down the tube , and position the guy wire attachment plate at the correct height . @ord@ secure the low tube to the tower base with the m10 bolt and nyloc nut . tighten the nut until it just contact the tower base .

attach the guy wire @ord@ orientate guy wire attachment plate with their corner point towards the anchor . if they be not point towards the anchor , adjust them before continue . @ord@ uncoil each guy wire bundle and extend them to their respective anchor point . the fourth anchor point be directly under the tower . @ord@ begin attach the guy wire to the earth anchor at the side of the tower . • insert two cable thimble in each earth anchor eyelet . • thread an upper guy wire and low guy wire around its own cable thimble . • loosely attach two cable clamp to each guy wire .

@ord@ leave about @card@ " inch ( @card@ cm ) of slack in the guy wire , and tighten the cable clamp . note : the guy wire to the tower should contact the " saddle ' side of the cable clamp . on level ground , there will be approximately @card@ ft ( @card@ m ) of extra cable . @ord@ attach two cable thimble to the third earth anchor locate directly below the tower .

@ord@ measure the length of the upper and low guy wire on the side earth anchor . use the same length for the guy wire on the third earth anchor . @ord@ secure the cable clamp to the third guy wire . @ord@ place two cable thimble on the fourth earth anchor . do not connect the guy wire at this time . @ord@ the fourth set of guy wire be use to help tilt the tower into position . secure these guy wire only after the tower be upright . it be important to remember during installation that guy wire must not become twisted , please take time to ensure all wire be as straight as possible . raise the tower sunforce product Inc. highly recommend first tilt the tower into position without the wind generator attach , to verify proper installation and operation of the tower . @ord@ before raise the tower , have another person ready to assist with installation . @ord@ one person should push the tower up into position . the other person should pull by the unattached upper guy wire . with the tower off the ground a few foot , make sure that all the wire be come up cleanly . adjust the guy wire if the guy wire be too tight they may cause the tower to bow as it be raise . if this happen , lower the tower to the ground and reduce the tension on the guy wire . • check to see which wire ( s ) be too tight ( the wire act in pair ) . • release the tension on one of the wire by loosen the @card@ cable clamp until the cable can be slide through them • let out some cable until there be no tension in the wire . @ord@ retighten the cable clamp before raise the tower . @ord@ once the tower be raise to vertical , attach the last guy wire to their anchor . @ord@ walk a short distance from the tower and look to see that it be straight . a visual check be vital throughout the installation process and can often speed up the process , by adjust as you go . @ord@ focus on the angle of the tower . adjust the cable until the tower be straight up and down . use a carpenter ' S level hold against the tower for this check . @ord@ to adjust the angle of the tower , relax one guy wire and tighten the guy wire opposite to it . repeat this process until the tower be straight . @ord@ when the tower be straight , make sure that all cable clamp be tight . @ord@ after all the adjustment have be make , lower the tower . important : when the tower be lower to install the wind generator , undo only the pull-side cable . when adjust the cable , never loosen both set of guy wire at the same time . when the tower be re-erected , only those pullside cable will need to be readjust . install your sunforce product wind turbine please refer to your sunforce product wind turbine manual for assembly instruction . maintenance there be no move part in the tower , so maintenance be minimal . however , as part of your annual maintenance , sunforce product , Inc. recommend that several area be inspect to ensure long term integrity of your wind turbine tower kit . • check guy wire condition . inspect for wear and fray at the guy wire to earth anchor connection point . • check guy wire tension . guy wire should have uniform tension . wire should be free of slack , but not overly taut . • check all bolt for tightness . • check cable clamp and pivot bolt . • check any unusual noise or vibration . investigate and correct as necessary .

sélection de votre emplacement l'information contenue dan la présente section offre les détails sur l'emplacement idéal pour une tour d'éolienne . s'il n'existe pas d'emplacement idéal dan votre secteur , localisez le meilleur emplacement possible . rappelez-vous qu'un emplacement adéquat accroît l'efficacité et la sécurité . de petites augmentation de la Vitesse moyenne du vent résultent en des augmentation dramatiques de l'énergie de sortie de l'éolienne . par exemple , une augmentation de @card@ % de la Vitesse moyenne du vent [ @card@ à @card@ m / s ( @card@ à @card@ mi / h ) ] assure une augmentation d'environ @card@ % de la puissance générée par le vent . donc , plus l'emplacement est bon , plus la performance est bonne . en règle générale , l'éolienne devrait être montée aussi haut et aussi loin des obstacle que possible . ceci assurera un tunnel aérodynamique libre . il existe deux exigence fondamentales pour le bon emplacement d'une éolienne : • des vent ayant une bonne vitesse moyenne ; • des vent très peu affectés par la turbulence . plus la turbulence est faible , moins votre éolienne sera soumisse aux tension , plus Elle durera et plus d'énergie Elle générera . les turbulence sont créées pas les obstruction . Gardez ce qui suit en tête lorsque vous êtes à la recherche d'un emplacement : • une tour directement dan le sen du vent derrière un immeuble devrait dépasser d'au moins @card@ , @card@ m ( @card@ pi ) la hauteur de l'immeuble . • la tour devrait dépasser d'au moins @card@ , @card@ m ( @card@ pi ) tout obstacle dan un rayon de @card@ , @card@ m ( @card@ pi ) . Vitesse du vent votre éolienne génère de l'énergie lorsque le vent souffle . un panneau photovoltaïque ( pv ) produit de l'énergie lorsque le soleil brille . ceci est normal selon les changements saisonniers . lorsque le Soleil brille avec force , le temp est généralement calme ; lorsqu'il y a des nuages , généralement , le vent souffle .

pour que votre éolienne produise de l'énergie , la Vitesse moyenne du vent à votre emplacement devrait être d'au moins @card@ , @card@ mètres / seconde ( @card@ mile / heure ) . si les vent dan votre secteur ont une vitesse moyenne inférieure à @card@ , @card@ m / s ( @card@ mi / h ) , vous devriez peut-être considérer la possibilité d'installer un système photovoltaïque ( pv ) près de votre éolienne , créant ainsi un système d'énergie renouvelable hybride . topographie si , au départ , votre emplacement est plat , la topographie ne cause pas de problème lors de la sélection de l'emplacement de votre éolienne . il existe des cas où l'emplacement le plus élevé disponible n'est pas nécessairement le meilleur endroit pour installer votre éolienne . l'emplacement le plus élevé environnant peut être difficile d'accès , Trop éloigné de l'endroit où vous avez besoin d'électricité Ou peut soumettre votre éolienne à des condition de turbulence pouvant causer des dommages . le temp utilisé pour analyser la topographie avant l'installation est d'une importance capitale . obstacle les obstacle ( immeubles , arbres , etc . entravant le passage du vent ) produisent des sillages pouvant s'étendre sou le vent à une très grande distance de l'obstacle et à une hauteur excédant de beaucoup la hauteur de l'obstacle . ces sillages sont des secteurs où la Vitesse du vent diminue et peut causer des turbulence potentiellement dangereuses . les obstacle près de l'éolienne affecteront la performance de celle-ci . configuration de la base de la tour et des ancres de terre rappelez-vous que vous devez être deux personnes pour assembler votre ensemble de tour d'éolienne . configuration de la tour la tour est d'abord assemblée au sol et puis , seulement après l'assemblage est-elle levée en position . la base de la tour supporte la tour au sol et Sert de point d pivot pour élever et abaisser celle-ci . deux ensemble d'haubans ( un ensemble supérieur et un ensemble inférieur ayant quatre câbles par ensemble ) sécurisent la tour à la verticale . • • l'ensemble de haubans supérieur sécurise la tour à une hauteur d'environ @card@ , @card@ m ( @card@ pi ) . l'ensemble d haubans inférieur sécurise la tour à une hauteur d'environ @card@ , @card@ m ( @card@ pi ) .

quatre ancres de terre à têtes de flèche [ situées à environ @card@ , @card@ m ( @card@ pi ) de la base de la tour à tous les @card@ ° ] fixent les haubans au sol . un hauban supérieur et un hauban inférieur se fixent à chaque ancre de terre . assemblage de la tour - à flanc de coteau si possible , positionnez la tour pour qu'elle s'abaisse vers le haut de la colline , le haut de la tour se trouvant en amont de la base . ceci ajoutera de la stabilité à la tour . base de la tour @card@ ) localisez l'emplacement où vous installerez la tour . placez la base de la tour au sol , l'orientant dan la direction vers laquelle la tour sera inclinée . 2 ) demandez à une personne de se positionner à la base de la tour en tenant un ruban à mesurer . 3 ) la seconde personne saisit alors l'extrémité du Ruban à mesurer et se déplace jusqu'à @card@ , @card@ m ( @card@ pi ) et Marche en rond autour de la base de la tour . • assurez-vous qu'il n'existe aucune obstruction autour de la circonférence . • assurez-vous qu'il existe suffisamment d'espace pour lever la tour en position et installer l'éolienne . 4 ) enfoncez les quatre piquet de fixation de la base de la tour dan le sol les orientant vers le centre de la base tel qu'illustré ci-dessous .

ancres de terre à pointe de flèche @ord@ placez la première ancre de terre au sol sur l'axe d'inclinaison de la tour à @card@ , @card@ mètres ( @card@ pi ) de la base . @ord@ placez la seconde ancre de terre au sol sur l'axe d'inclinaison de la tour à @card@ , @card@ mètres ( @card@ pi ) de la base dan la direction opposée . • la base de la tour se trouvant au centre , les première et seconde ancres de terre devraient former une ligne droite de @card@ , @card@ mètre ( @card@ pi ) sur l'axe d'inclinaison de la tour . @ord@ placez la troisième ancre de terre à @card@ , @card@ mètres ( @card@ pi ) de la base de la tour . @ord@ placez la quatrième ancre de terre à @card@ , @card@ mètres ( @card@ pi ) de la base de la tour . • la base de la tour se trouvant au centre , les troisième et quatrième ancres de terre devraient former une ligne droite perpendiculaire à la ligne formée par les deux première ancres de terre . @ord@ vérifiez les position des ancres de terre pour vous assurer qu'elles se trouvent à environ @card@ cm ( @card@ po ) de leurs position idéales . • chaque ancre de terre devrait se trouver à @card@ , @card@ mètres ( @card@ pi ) de la base de la tour . • la distance entre chaque ancre de terre devrait être de @card@ , @card@ m ( @card@ , @card@ pi ) . @ord@ insérez l'extrémité en biseau de la Tige d'enfouissement d'ancre de terre dan la tête de flèche de l'ancre de terre Tel qu'indiqué ci-dessous . @ord@ enfoncez l'ancre de terre avec force au moyen de la Tige d'enfouissement d'ancre de terre et d'une masse de @card@ kg ( @card@ lb ) .

•

notez à quel angle l'ancre de terre est enfoncée dan le sol . cet angle est important pour assurer une force d'ancrage maximale . l'angle devrait correspondre à l'angle des haubans et s'aligner au plan joignant le point d'ancrage et la base de la tour .

important : chaque ancre de terre doit être enfouie dan un sol non dérangé . @ord@ enfoncez l'ancre de terre dan le sol jusqu'à ce qu'une longueur de @card@ cm ( @card@ po ) du câble Demeure en dehors du sol .

@ord@ puis , passez la Tige d'enfouissement d'ancre de terre dan l'œil du câble et tirez légèrement . vous noterez que le câble de l'ancre de terre sortira quelque peu . cette opération bloquera l'ancre de terre dan le sol . remarque : le câble de l'ancre de terre ne devrait pas sortir du sol de plus de @card@ cm ( @card@ po ) lorsque l'ancre est bloquée en place . @ord@ complétez l'installation des autres trois ancres de terre en suivant la même procédure .

important : l'ancre de terre a été conçue pour passer à travers les petites pierres . cependant , si une Pierre Ou une obstruction est trop grosse , retirez et relocalisez l'ancre . la profondeur d'enfouissement de l'ancre est essentielle pour assurer son efficacité . assemblage de la tour l'assemblage de la tour comporte plusieurs étapes simple . s'il s'agit d'une installation permanente , creusez tout d'abord une tranchée allant de la base de la tour jusqu'aux installation abritant les battery . ceci facilitera la pose des câbles allant de votre éolienne jusqu'à l'ensemble des battery .

configuration des tuyaux de la tour @ord@ placez les six tuyaux de la tour au sol tel qu'indiqué . assurer un jeu d'environ @card@ cm ( @card@ po ) entre chaque tuyau .

@ord@ alors que les tuyaux sont placés tel qu'indiqué à la page précédente , glissez les plaque de fixation des haubans Sur les tuyaux correspondants de la tour . • glissez la plaque de fixation des haubans de @card@ , @card@ m ( @card@ pi ) sur le tuyau du Haut de la tour . • glissez la plaque de fixation des haubans de @card@ , @card@ m ( @card@ pi ) sur le quatrième tuyau de la tour à partir du bas .

@ord@ alignez les plaque de fixation des haubans pour que les haubans soient en ligne avec les ancres de terre . @ord@ lorsque les deux plaque de fixation des haubans sont en place , les câbles électriques peuvent être acheminés dan les tuyaux de la tour . laissez suffisamment de câble dépassant le haut de la tour pour permettre de brancher l'éolienne . • les câbles électriques peuvent aussi être acheminés dan les tuyaux au moyen d'un tire-fils lorsque les tuyaux de la tour sont assemblé . @ord@ assemblez les tuyaux de la tour en utilisant un maillet ou un marteau . utilisez un morceau de Bois entre le tuyau et la massette pour protéger l'extrémité du tuyau .

l'extrémité expansé du tuyau empêche la plaque de fixation des haubans de glisser le long des tuyaux et positionne celle-ci à la bonne hauteur . @ord@ sécurisez le tuyau du bas de la tour à la base de la tour au moyen du boulon m10 et de l'écrou nyloc . serrez l'écrou jusqu'à ce qu'il fasse tout juste contact avec les languettes de la base de la tour . •

fixation des haubans @ord@ orientez les plaque de fixation des haubans pour que leurs coin pointent vers les ancres de terre . s'ils ne pointent pas dan cette direction , ajustez-les avant de procéder . @ord@ déroulez chaque hauban dan la direction de son point d'ancrage respectif . le quatrième point d'ancrage se situe directement en ligne avec le pied de la tour . @ord@ commencez par raccorder les haubans aux ancres de terre Sur les côtés de la tour opposés à l'axe de pivotement de celle-ci . • insérez deux coss de câble dan chaque œil d'ancre de terre . • enfilez un hauban supérieur et un hauban inférieur autour de Sa propre cosse de câble . • installez sans trop serrer deux serre-câbles sur chaque hauban .

@ord@ laissez un jeu d'environ @card@ cm ( @card@ po ) dan les haubans et serrez les serre-câbles . remarque : le hauban allant à la tour devrait entrer en contact avec le côté de la collerette du serre-câbles . sur un sol à niveau , il y aura environ @card@ , @card@ m ( @card@ pi ) de câble de trop . @ord@ installez deux coss de câbles à la troisième ancre de terre située directement au pied de la tour . @ord@ mesurez les longueur des haubans supérieurs et inférieurs aux ancres de terre latéraux . utilisez les mêmes longueur pour les haubans de la troisième ancre de terre . @ord@ sécurisez les serre-câbles des troisièmes haubans . @ord@ installez deux coss de câble sur la quatrième ancre de terre . ne raccordez pas ces haubans maintenant . @ord@ le quatrième ensemble d'haubans sont utilisés pour ériger la tour en position . ne sécurisez ces haubans que lorsque la tour est à la verticale . il est important de se rappeler que durant l'installation il faut éviter de tordre les haubans . veuillez donc prendre le temp requis pour vous assurer que tous les haubans soient aussi droit que possible . érection de la tour sunforce product inc. recommande fortement d'ériger tout d'abord la tour en position sans l'éolienne pour s'assurer d'une installation et d'un fonctionnement adéquat de la tour . @ord@ avant d'ériger la tour , assurez-vous d'avoir quelqu'un pour vous aider durant l'installation . @ord@ une personne devrait lever la tour en position en poussant sur celle-ci . l'autre personne devrait tirer au moyen du hauban supérieur non fixé . lorsque la tour se trouve à quelques pieds du sol , assurez-vous que tous les haubans s'élèvent correctement . ajustement des haubans si les haubans sont trop serrés , ils peuvent courber la tour lors de l'érection . dan ce Cas , abaissez la tour au sol et réduisez la tension des haubans . • vérifiez quels haubans sont trop serrés ( les haubans agissent en paire ) . • relâchez la tension de l'un des haubans en desserrant les deux serre-câbles jusqu'à ce que l'hauban puisse glisser . • relâchez suffisamment d'hauban pour éliminer la tension . @ord@ resserrez les serre-câbles avant d'ériger la tour . @ord@ lorsque la tour est à la verticale , fixez les derniers haubans à leur ancre de terre . 5 . éloignez-vous à une petite distance de la tour et assurez-vous qu'elle est droite et à la verticale . une vérification visuelle tout au cours du processus de l'installation est vitale et peut accélérer ce processus en effectuant des ajustements au fur et à mesure que le travail avance . @ord@ portez particulièrement attention à la position verticale de la tour . ajustez les haubans jusqu'à ce que la tour soit droite et verticale sur toute sa longueur . utilisez un niveau de menuisier contre la tour pour cette vérification . @ord@ pour ajuster la position verticale de la tour , relâchez un hauban et resserrez l'hauban opposé . répétez ce processus jusqu'à ce que la tour soit à la verticale . @ord@ lorsque la tour est à la verticale , assurez-vous que tous les serre-câbles soient bien serrés . @ord@ lorsque tous les ajustements ont été effectués , abaissez la tour .

important : lorsque la tour est abaissée pour l'installation de l'éolienne , ne défaire que les haubans sur lesquels on a tiré pour lever la tour . lors de l'ajustement des haubans , ne relâchez jamais en même temp les deux ensemble d'haubans . lorsque la tour est érigée de nouveau , seuls les haubans sur lesquels on a tiré devront être réajustés . installation de votre éolienne sunforce product veuillez référer au Manuel de votre éolienne sunforce product pour les instruction d'assemblage . entretien il n'existe aucune pièce mobile dan la tour ; de ce fait , l'entretien est minimal . cependant , au cours de votre entretien annuel , sunforce product , Inc. recommande que plusieurs zone soient inspectées pour assurer l'intégrité à long terme de votre ensemble de tour d'éolienne . • vérifiez l'état des haubans . inspectez les point de raccordement des haubans et des ancres de terre pour tout indice d'usure Ou d'effilochage . • vérifiez la tension des haubans . les haubans devraient tous avoir une tension similaire . les haubans ne devraient être ni lâches , ni trop tendus . • vérifiez que tous les boulons soient Bien serrés . • vérifiez les serre-câbles et le boulon axe de pivot . • vérifiez tous les bruit et les vibrations inusités . investiguez et corrigez au besoin .

selección del lugar para la instalación la información contenida en Esta sección le proporcionará especificidades sobre el lugar ideal para la instalación de la Torre . si no hay ningún lugar idóneo en Su área , Busque la mejor ubicación posible . recuerde que Una ubicación idónea incrementa la eficiencia y la seguridad . pequeñas mejoras en velocidades medias del viento resultan en incrementos sustanciales de generación de energía del aerogenerador . por ejemplo , un incremento de la velocidad del viento del @card@ % ( @card@ mph - @card@ mph ; @card@ m / s - @card@ m / s ) proporciona aproximadamente un incremento del @card@ % de generación . por tanto , cuanto mejor sea la ubicación , mejor será el rendimiento . Como regla general , el aerogenerador debería instalarse tan alto y tan lejos como sea posible de cualquier Tipo de obstáculo . esto creará un área de viento despejado . dos requerimientos básicos para un buen lugar para el aerogenerador : • Buen promedio de velocidad de viento anual • bajas turbulencias cuanto más Baja sean la turbulencias , el aerogenerador soportará menor estrés , mayor será Su durabilidad , y producirá mayor cantidad de energía . la turbulencias están creadas por los obstáculos .

mantenga en Mente los siguientes detalles cuando esté decidiendo la ubicación para la instalación : : • una torre instalada en un edificio , debería estar como mínimo @card@ m por encima del Edificio • la Torre debería colocarse @card@ m por encima de cualquier Barrera en un radio de @card@ m velocidad del viento Su aerogenerador producirá energía cuando haya viento . un panel solar fotovoltaico ( pv ) producirá energía cuando brille el sol . esto es típico en cambios de estación . cuando el tiempo es soleado , normalmente el viento está en Calma ; cuando está nublado , el tiempo es normalmente ventoso . para que Su aerogenerador produzca energía , la velocidad medium del viento en Su ubicación debe ser al menos de @card@ , @card@ m / s ( @card@ mph ) si el viento en Su Zona es menor de @card@ , @card@ m / S , debería plantearse instalar módulos fotovoltaicos ( pv ) para crear un sistema de energías renovables híbrido topografía si Su ubicación es Plana , la topografía no supone ningún problema a la hora de decidir dónde colocar el aerogenerador . se dan circunstancias donde la Zona de tierra más alta disponible no sea el mejor lugar . la Zona de tierra más alta puede ser de difícil acceso , puede que esté muy lejos de donde necesite la energía , o puede que el lugar exponga al aerogenerador a condiciones turbulentas potencialmente peligrosas . el tiempo previo invertido en considerar la topografía para la instalación es vital . barreras la barreras ( edificios , árboles , etc . que impidan el flujo del viento ) producen estelas que pueden extenderse muy por debajo de la Zona de afectación de la mismas , y también por encima de la mismas . estas zonas afectadas por la estelas son zonas de menor velocidad de viento y Donde se pueden producir turbulencias potencialmente peligrosas . la barreras cerca del aerogenerador afectarán a su resultado . diseño de la base de la Torre & anclaje a tierra recuerde que el kit de la Torre debería ser instalado por al menos @card@ persona . . diseño de la tower la Torre se monta en el suelo , y solo entonces se podrá poner en Su posición correcta . la base de la Torre soporta la Torre en el suelo , y sirve como el punto pivote para bajar y subir la Torre . dos grupos de vientos ( uno superior y otro inferior con @card@ cable por Grupo ) asegurarán la torre verticalmente : • el grupo superior de vientos asegura la Torre a una altura aproximada de @card@ m . • el grupo inferior de vientos asegura la Torre a una altura aproximada de @card@ m . cuatro anclajes a la tierra con forma de flecha ( ubicadas aproximadamente a @card@ m desde la base de la Torre , a intervalos de @card@ ° ) aseguran los vientos al suelo . un viento superior y otro inferior se sujetan a cada anclaje a la tierra . montaje de la Torre - en ladera si posible , colocar la Torre para poder inclinarla fácilmente sobre el terreno . base de la Torre @ord@ decida el lugar donde va a instalar la Torre . coloque la base de la Torre en el suelo y oriéntela en la dirección hacia dónde va a inclinar la Torre . @ord@ una persona debe colocarse en la base de la torre con una cinta métrica . @ord@ la segunda persona deberá Coger la cinta métrica y caminar @card@ m en círculo alrededor de la base de la Torre . • asegúrese que no hay obstrucciones a lo largo de la circunferencia . • asegúrese que hay suficiente espacio para inclinar la Torre e instalar el aerogenerador . @ord@ cleave la @card@ puntas de sujeción a la tierra de la base en la tierra hacia el Centro de la base , según se muestra más abajo

anclajes a la tierra @ord@ coloque el primer anclaje en el suelo a lo largo del eje de inclinación de la Torre , a @card@ m de la base de la Torre . @ord@ coloque el Segundo anclaje a lo largo del eje de inclinación de la Torre , a @card@ m de la base de la Torre , en dirección opuesta . • con la base de la Torre en el centro , el primer y el Segundo anclaje deberían formar Una línea recta de @card@ m a lo largo del eje de inclinación de la Torre . @ord@ coloque el tercer anclaje a @card@ m de la base de la Torre . @ord@ coloque el cuarto anclaje a @card@ m de la base de la torre • con la base de la Torre en el centro , el tercer y Cuarto anclajes deberían formar una línea perpendicular a la línea formada por el primer y Segundo anclajes . @ord@ compruebe la posición de los anclajes para asegurar que no están a más de @card@ cm de Su posición ideal . • Cada anclaje a la tierra debería estar a @card@ m . de la base de la Torre . @ord@ introducir una barra en Cada anclaje . ver foto . @ord@ tire de los anclajes con fuerza hasta que se fijen Bien al suelo .

notum : no debería quedar más de @card@ cm de cable fuera del suelo Una vez fijado definitivamente en su lugar . • fíjese en el ángulo en el que se está clavando el anclaje . Este ángulo es importante para obtener Una fuera de amarre máxima . el ángulo debería estar en línea con el ángulo del viento ( e.g. . el ángulo debería estar apuntando hacia la base de la Torre ) . importante : Cada anclaje a tierra debe instalarse en suelo que no haya sido alterado . @ord@ clave el anclaje en la Tierra hasta que quede @card@ cm de cable sobre el suelo .

@ord@ después , inserte el cable por Lo orificios de la Flecha y tire . @ord@ finalice instalando los @card@ anclajes según se ha descrito Arriba .

importante : a pesar de que el anclaje a tierra está diseñado para perforar pequeñas piedras , si hay una roca u obstrucción grande , coloque el anclaje en otro lugar . la profundidad del anclaje es crítica para conseguir su efectividad . montaje de la Torre la Torre se monta en varios pasos sencillos . si se trata de Una instalación permanente , primero cave una zanja desde la base de la Torre hasta Donde vaya a colocar la batería . esto ayudará a facilitar la instalación del cableado de Su aerogenerador al Banco de baterías . diseño de los Tubos de la Torre @ord@ coloque los @card@ tubos de la Torre en el suelo según se muestra . deje aproximadamente @card@ cm entre cada tubo .

@ord@ con los tubos colocados según se ha explicado , deslice la place de los vientos en los tubos correspondientes . • deslice la placa del viento de @card@ m sobre el tubo superior . • deslice la placa del viento de @card@ m sobre el cuarto tubo contado desde abajo

@ord@ alinee la placa del viento de modo que Cada viento esté alineado con los anclajes . @ord@ con todas la placas de los vientos en posición , se puede insertar el cable eléctrico a través de los tubos inferiores . deje suficiente cable saliendo de la parte superior de la Torre para conectar el aerogenerador . • también se puede tirar del cable eléctrico con un tira-hilos , después de que los Tubos de la torre estén montados . @ord@ junte los Tubos de la torre utilizando un Mazo con goma para proteger el extremo del tubo .

• el extremo expandido del tubo previene que la placas de amare de los vientos se deslicen en el tubo hacia abajo , y coloca la placa de amarre de los vientos en su altura correcta . @ord@ asegure el tubo inferior a la base con el tornillo m10 y la tuerca . apriete la tuerca hasta que Haga contacto con la base de la Torre .

fijando los vientos @ord@ oriente la placas de amarre de los vientos con sus esquinas apuntando hacia el anclaje . si no están apuntando hacia el anclaje , ajústelas ante de continuar . @ord@ desenrosque cada Grupo de vientos y extiéndalos a los puntos de anclaje respectivos . el cuarto punto de anclaje está directamente bajo la Torre . @ord@ comience amarrando los vientos de anclaje que están a los lados de la Torre .

@ord@ deje alrededor de @card@ cm de cable flojo en los vientos , y apriete la abrazaderas del cable notum : debe de sobrar cerca de @card@ m de cable extra . @ord@ enganchar dos vientos con el de tierra justo a pie de la toree @ord@ medir la longitud de los vientos alto y bajo . usar esa misma longitud para la tercera sujeción a tierra . @ord@ asegurar el tercer viento . @ord@ enganchar los dos cable del cuarto cable a tierra . no conectar los vientos en este momento . @ord@ el cuarto conjunto de vientos serán necesarios para levantar la Torre a Su posición definitiva . asegurar estos vientos solo cuando la Torre Este en Su posición definitiva .

es muy importante asegurar durante la instalación que todos los vientos estén libre , sin enredarse , por favro tome su tiempo en asegurar que todos los vientos estén siempre lo más estirados posibles . levantar la Torre le recomendamos especialmente que la primera vez que instale la Torre Lo Haga sin el aerogenerador , para verificar que todo es correcto y no habrá ningún problema posterior . @ord@ ante de elevar la Torre , es necesario que otra persona le ayude en la instalación . @ord@ una persona podrá levantar la Torre a Su posición y la otra podrá fijar el último viento . mientras levante la Torre fíjese que todos los vientos están correctos y que no hay nada enredado . ajustando los vientos si los vientos están excesivamente ajustados , podría dificultar la elevación de la Torre . si ocurre esto , baje la Torre y reduzca la tensión de los vientos . • chequee que vientos están demasiado tensos ( recuerde que los vientos actúan por pare • reduzca la tensión de los vientos soltando un poco el clip de fijación hasta que deslicen un poco los cable . • saca un poco de cable hasta que la tensión desaparezca . @ord@ reajuste los clip de fijación ante de elevar de Nuevo la Torre . @ord@ Una vez la Torre este elevada en vertical , sujetar el ultimo viento en la tierra correspondiente . @ord@ verificar visualmente si la Torre Esta recta . hágalo a cierta distancia , unos metro . Este chequeo visual es importante para evitar posteriores trabajos . @ord@ ajustar los cable hasta que la Torre quede totalmente recta . usar un nivel para asegura la verticalidad . @ord@ para ajustar el ángulo de la Torre , aflojar un Lado del viento y ajustar el cable contrario . repetir Esta operación hasta que la Torre este recta . @ord@ cuando la torre este recta , asegurarse de que todos los cable están ajustados . @ord@ después de todos estos ajustes , bajar la Torre . importante : cunod la Torre Este Bajada para instalar el aerogenerador , suelte solo los cable que vaya a tirar posteriormente . nunca suelte ambo lados a la vez . cuando la Torre sea levantada de Nuevo , solo será necesario tirar de estos cable . . instalar el aerogenerador sunforce por favor , lea el manual de instalación del aerogenerador mantenimiento no hay partes móviles en la Torre , por Lo que el mantenimiento es mínimo . sin embargo , como parte de Su mantenimiento anual , le recomendamos que se inspeccionen varia áreas con el fin de asegurar larga Vida e integridad de Su Torre • compruebe la condición de los vientos . inspeccione detenidamente los vientos t y la union a los cable de tierra . • compruebe la tensión de los vientos . los vientos deberían tener tensión uniforme . los vientos deberían estar suficientemente tensados pero no demasiado tirantes . • compruebe que todos los tornillos están debidamente fijados y apretados . • chequee los clip de fijación y la tuercas . • compruebe cualquier ruido extraño o cualquier vibración no habitual . investigue y corríjalo si necesario .

introduction
offshore wind resource estimate have be perform for some part of the us , include the mid Atlantic bight [ Kempton et al . , @card@ ] , Georgia [ Elliott and Schwartz , @card@ ] , and lake michigan [ owen , robert h . , Jr. , @card@ ] . as far as the author know , only one california offshore wind resource estimate be perform to date [ musial and butterfield , @card@ ] . this estimate , which rely on @card@ m height mesoscale weather model prediction that the author state have not be validate with actual wind datum , find that significant resource potential

exist off the coast of california in mostly deep water . this resource assessment break up usable area by depth ( @card@ to @card@ m depth and " deep " ) and distance from the shore ( @card@ nautical mile and @card@ nautical mile ) . this methodology exclude significant shallow water area , with good wind resource , close to the shore . further , the study be base on a @card@ m turbine hub height ; a height at which modern wind turbine be no longer build . several study have look at wind off the california coast [ haack , et al . , @card@ ; arch , et al . , 2005a ] but not for the purpose of wind energy assessment . an overall global wind energy study that scale buoy datum off the california coast to the @card@ m height find good offshore wind resource do exist at some of the buoy site [ archer , et al . , 2005b ] . this study analyze the california offshore wind energy potential at the modern1 hub height of @card@ m . tall turbine hub take advantage of high wind speed aloft due to reduce surface friction and hence , produce more power give the same wind resource . the format of this resource assessment study , be loosely base on a offshore wind resource assessment methodology from the university of Delaware [ dhanju et al . , @card@ ] . in this study , we calculate the usable surface area of three different depth class ( @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ m max depth ) off coastal california , calculate the average wind speed at these location , and finally calculate the total power and annual energy output . in order to come up with useful energy calculation , it be necessary to pick a specific turbine model . the repower 5m @card@ mw turbine [ repower sytem ag , @card@ ] with a @card@ m rotor diameter be choose for this study . although the hub height for the offshore repower 5m , be @card@ m , this study use the more conservative @card@ m height . you could expect to find approximately @card@ % more wind power at the @card@ m height , base on traditional coefficient use for the power law2 . in order to estimate wind offshore , where little in-situ datum exist , the Penn . state / national center for atmospheric research mesoscale model version @card@ ( mm5 ) weather model be run at @card@ km and @card@ km resolution over the entire state of california and san francisco bay area respectively . mm5 be run for the month of January , april , july , and November @card@ to approximate seasonal and an annual average for the california offshore wind resource . use these @card@ m wind speed , in conjunction with the bathymetry suitable for offshore turbine development near the coast , a power and energy total of the california resource be calculate .

model the california offshore wind resource
the Penn state university / ncar mesoscale model version @card@ ( mm5 ) be use to model the wind offshore california at high resolution . one parent domain at @card@ km horizontal resolution be create over the entire on and offshore region of interest in california . a @card@ km horizontal resolution , 1-way nested-domain be
@card@ it should be note that the some turbine have high turbine height than @card@ m . the enercon e-112 ( @card@ - @card@ mw ) have a hub height of @card@ m [ enercon , @card@ ] . the vesta v90 @card@ mw have a hub height between @card@ - @card@ m [ vesta , @card@ ] . @card@ for example , use the wind profile power law with  = @card@ , yield a @card@ % increase over the @card@ m to @card@ m wind speed ; a @card@ % increase in power

create over the san francisco bay area . figure @card@ show the domain configuration for mm5 . in order to more accurately resolve the wind at the @card@ m height , two additional horizontal layer ( sigma-levels ) be add to the mm5 model directly above and below the @card@ m offshore height , with a total vertical resolution of 28-levels ( ptop = @card@ hpa ) . a linear interpolation be use post process to calculate the @card@ m wind speed . the @card@ m wind speed be also calculate , for future validation study that will utilize offshore buoy wind datum ( typically at the @card@ m height ) . all of the wind datum be insert into a large , geospatial database that allow geospatial query of the wind datum overlie with the bathymetry datum . figure @card@ show the model average @card@ m wind speed for the month of January , april , july , and October @ord@ the mm5 model run , use 8processors on a gnu / linux cluster , use all of the default mm5 physics option . the national center for @card@ km environmental prediction @card@ degree by @card@ resolution degree global final ( fnl ) analysis be use to create initial and boundary condition for mm5 [ national center for environmental prediction , @ord@ boundary condition be update every @card@ hour . the model be figure @card@ : mother and nest 1-way restart every @card@ day and reinitialized domain at @card@ and @card@ km respectively with the fnl datum . an additional @card@ use for model the @card@ m offshore hour be add to each model run to wind resource . the @card@ m wind field allow the model to spin-up before wind be derive by increase the vertical field be use . this extra @card@ hour resolution of mm5 around the @card@ m be throw out and not use in the height . calculation of the wind resource . use these four month of model datum with hourly output , a projected annual average wind speed at each offshore location be predict . a temporal analysis of wind speed for a specific site ( off of cape mendocino ) use the average hourly output be also perform use this datum . although we have not fully validate this mm5 output against in-situ buoy and radiosounde datum , initial comparison of mm5 wind and buoy wind datum have look promise . future work will provide a complete validation of the mm5 model wind datum .

turbine tower support technology
an added constraint of offshore wind turbine be the depth at which turbine support tower can be place , as well as the extra cost associate with each

@card@ m wind speed ( m / S )

figure @card@ : model @card@ m wind resource , base on the four month mm5 model run ( January , april , july , and October @card@ ) . only wind resource from @card@ m depth be show on this map and only wind resource great than @card@ m / S and @card@ m / S be include in this study . pink area over land be urban center , where most of the offshore wind energy could be use .

tower technology . the economics of minimize the amount of underwater transmission cable lay and maintenance requirement of offshore wind turbine lend themselves to much large turbine than their onshore counterpart . further , offshore wind turbine be not limit by the maximum shipping size of truck , train , and roadway like their onshore counterpart . to estimate the wind resource potential base on depth , the bathymetry datum be classify by each type of turbine support technology . California generally have much deep water offshore than other location where resource assessment have be perform . in extremely shallow water ( up to @card@ meter depth ) , gravity base structure have be use . for this study , we have neglect the gravity base structure , due to their limited utility with California ' s deep water . monopile turbine tower support structure structure can be place in water up to @card@ meter depth ( old and cheap technology ) [ Henderson et al . , @card@ ] and new water jacket tripod / quadrapods can be place in water up to @card@ m depth [ talisman energy , @card@ ] . in the propose Beatrice offshore wind farm @card@ km ( @card@ mi ) off the coast of scotland , monopile : water jacket floating : support tower will be @card@ m tripod : 50m-200m locate at @card@ meter 20m-50m ( future ) depth . two different water depth figure @card@ : example of the three different class of jacket tripod support turbine support structure . image @card@ & @card@ source : design will use either [ owe , @card@ ] . image @card@ source : [ nrel , @card@ ] drive steel pile or suction pile to hold the tower to the sea bed [ Henderson et al . , @card@ ] . a water jacket structure be install in the summer of @card@ in @card@ m depth water at the beatrice wind farm demonstrator project , off the coast of Scotland [ rea , @card@ ] . lastly , it be likely that floating turbine structure , similar to oil and gas platform today will be develop in the next @card@ year , capable of depth of up to @card@ m [ mit , @card@ ] . these depth be use as technology constraint throughout the study and coincide with the depth use in the offshore wind assessment methodology [ dhanju et al . , @card@ ] , with the exception of deep water be consider @card@ m depth ( instead of @card@ m depth ) . figure @card@ illustrate three example of these different class of turbine support technology .

calculation of offshore area suitable for turbine
in order to determine the amount of usable area off the california coast suitable for offshore wind turbine , a base layer of bathymetry ( underwater depth ) be use and divide into tower technology class ( @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ m max depth ) . the national geophysical datum center ( ngdc ) 3-arc second coastal relief model [ noaa and ngdc , @card@ ] provide approximately @card@ m horizontal resolution3 over the california domain . this bathymetry datum be of significantly high resolution than use in the previous offshore wind resource assessment of california , which use a @card@ km resolution dataset [ musial and butterfield , @card@ ] . where wind speed have an annual average of @card@ and @card@ m / s or high , they be include as usable water area where offshore wind could be develop . the @card@ m / s cutoff be choose to coincide with the nrel class @card@ resource , with a standard power density of @card@ w / m2 [ Elliott et al . , @card@ ] . the @card@ m / s cutoff be choose to include the future possibility of an offshore wind turbine that could utilize low wind speed . the geospatial intersection of the ngdc bathymetry datum and the annual model wind resource great than @card@ m / S and @card@ m / S be the basis for the surface area in table @card@ below .

table @card@ : usable amount of offshore surface area suitable for wind turbine development contain within each depth region . only area that have wind speed high than @card@ m / S and @card@ m / S be include in this study .

in order to simplify the offshore wind resource assessment , the average wind speed be group by ocean depth and cutoff wind speed , show in table @ord@ these average annual @card@ m wind speed be use in the calculation of the turbine capacity factor and nameplate capacity , which in turn will yield an annual energy output .

estimate of wind power and energy offshore
in order to determine how much surface area would be require for each turbine , a 4-diameter by 7-diameter spacing [ master , @card@ ] be choose between turbine , where the turbine diameter be @card@ m . each repower 5m turbine would require @card@ km2 of area per turbine . in order to account for the surface area that would potentially be unusable due to ship lane , restricted wildlife preservation area , viewshed consideration , etc ... , a @card@ % exclusionary factor for all possible turbine area be include in each nameplate capacity and energy calculation . future study should look at the detail of each area ' s exclusion zone , in order to more precisely calculate amount of usable surface area . table @card@ show the nameplate capacity of each geographical region and depth class . table @card@ : nameplate capacity of turbine ( mw ) in each geographical area , depth , and wind speed cutoff , assume a @card@ % exclusionary factor for each area .

( @card@ )

combine the capacity factor calculation , the average wind speed for each turbine technology , and the usable area ( include a @card@ % exclusionary factor ) , an annual energy estimate have be make in table @ord@ table 4 : annual output energy ( twh ) in each geographical region , depth class , and cutoff wind speed . a @card@ % exclusionary factor be include in these calculation .

a significant amount of offshore wind energy potential do exist in california , with @card@ twh developable annually in all water . while the vast majority of the california offshore wind resource exist in deep water ( @card@ % ) , a significant amount of energy relative to california ' s overall electric generation capacity . each of the three geographical region be analyze in more depth , include access to exist transmission line in the follow section .

geographical context of the offshore wind resource
although more expensive to build , offshore wind turbine can often provide clean energy closer to california ' s coastal population center , where most of population reside . in order to provide geographical context for the california offshore wind resource , we map the water depth [ noaa / ngdc , @card@ ] , urban area [ usgs , @card@ ] , and exist transmission line [ fema , @card@ ] together in figure @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ for each california geographical region . figure @card@ can be consult to find the average model @card@ m wind resource . we combine the model wind resource , annual energy output estimate ( table @card@ ) , and the transmission / depth map to come up with the feasibility of develop offshore wind in each of the three geographical location . northern california ( figure @card@ ) could potentially provide @card@ twh of wind energy annually in relatively shallow water ( @card@ m ) , use existing turbine and tower

support technology.4 this amount of energy alone could offset @card@ % of California ' s current carbon emit electricity sources.5 further , if deep water turbine support technology be develop , @card@ % of California ' s current carbon electricity source could be replace by offshore wind energy in northern california alone.4 the initial assessment for the bay area ( figure @card@ ) look less viable for near term development . the good @card@ m wind resource seem to occur far from the city of san francisco and exist primarily in deep water ( @card@ m ) , with almost zero good wind resource in the bay itself ( see table @card@ for detail ) . most of the large transmission line would need to be access through the san francisco bay outlet , as little coastal transmission access exist . one potentially interesting location in the bay area be the farallon island ( manage by the city of san francisco ) , which appear to have the necessary wind resource ( > @card@ m / S ) and be surround by fairly shallow water ( < @card@ m depth ) . however , the length of undersea transmission cable require may be cost prohibitive , as the island be about @card@ km ( @card@ mile ) offshore . further , the island ' unique bird nest , marine mammal , and fish population would need careful review before turbine could be site in this location . a positive attribute of the island ' far distance from shore be that it would make the offshore wind turbine nearly impossible to see from san francisco and might quell any viewshed concern from city resident . base our initial assessment , southern california ( figure @card@ ) appear to have little easily developable offshore wind resource . it should be note that some of the offshore site analyze have good wind resource for three of the four @card@ month model , but have significantly reduce wind in the july @card@ month . while the pacific high pressure system locate off the southern california coast during the summer may suppress some of the wind , more modeling and validation need to be perform . it should be note that the southern california coast do however provide several excellent grid interconnection point . further , exist oil and gas platform in southern california may reduce public opposition to the site of wind farm .

@card@ use the more realistic cutoff of @card@ m / s , @card@ m wind speed . @card@ carbon emit electric generation ( coal , natural gas , and biomass ) be a total of @card@ twh in @card@ include in and out of state source [ cec , @card@ ] .

figure @card@ : bathymetry , urban area , and transmission line for northern california . the good california offshore wind resource exist in northern california but the region lack any large population center and any large transmission line near the coast . development in this region be still plausible , use the existing @card@ kv transmission line that run through eureka . see the section title " temporal analysis of wind " for detail .

z

figure @card@ : bathymetry , urban area , and transmission line for the san francisco bay area . ( see figure @card@ for legend . ) although a reasonable amount of shallow water exist near the bay , wind speed look to be marginal until the deep water be reach .

figure @card@ : bathymetry , urban area , and transmission line for southern california . ( see figure @card@ for legend . ) this study find good wind resource for three of the four month model ( January , april , and October @card@ ) , but reduce wind resource throughout much of southern california during the summer month model ( july @card@ ) . the reduce summer wind be likely due to the position of the large high pressure system ( pacific high ) that sit over the region in the summer month .

comparison of result to other estimate
musial and butterfield of the national renewable energy laboratory ( nrel ) in their @card@ estimate find that for shallow depth ( < @card@ m ) and deep water ( > @card@ m ) , @card@ , @card@ mw and @card@ , @card@ mw of developable wind power exist off the coast of california respectively , between @card@ and @card@ nautical mile ( @card@ km to @card@ km ) from shore . the study be base on the nrel @card@ m wind resource datum , which they state have not be validate for offshore condition . the nrel study also use different exclusionary percentage ; a conservative @card@ % for the @card@ nm ( @card@ km - @card@ km ) zone and @card@ % for the @card@ - @card@ nm ( @card@ km - @card@ km ) zone . the study also exclude @card@ % of the @card@ nm ( @card@ km ) zone near shore . the nrel study also do not use a cutoff wind speed , as this study do . for comparative purpose , this study find ( table @card@ ) @card@ , @card@ mw of capacity ( with a @card@ m / s cutoff ) in the @card@ m depth range ( approximately the @card@ m range use in the nrel study ) and @card@ , @card@ mw of capacity in the @card@ m-200 m depth range ( approximately the " deep " range for the nrel study ) . the nrel study do not include an energy output approximation , so it ' S not possible to compare the overall energy output of the offshore wind potential unfortunately . further , the nrel study be do at the @card@ m turbine height , compare to the @card@ m turbine height of this study . though the methodology and assumption differ significantly , both this study and the nrel study conclude similar order of approximation for the capacity ( within @card@ % for the shallow water and within @card@ % for the deep water ) .

temporal analysis of offshore wind
the time of day when wind power peak be important because the summer peak electric demand occur late in the afternoon , around @card@ : @card@ pm [ price , h . and cable , r . , @card@ ] . in order to analyze how offshore wind energy might fit into california ' s electric grid , a sample wind park in northern ca be create . figure @card@ show one example park , locate in some of the well offshore wind in california . the @card@ m wind resource we model for this propose wind park be extremely steady throughout most hour of the day and only slow from about @card@ m / S to @card@ m / s late in the afternoon during the july @card@ model month ; still an excellent wind resource overall . use equation @card@ , with the model annual average @card@ m wind speed of @card@ m / S , we find a @card@ % capacity factor for this wind park . use the same methodology to calculate turbine nameplate capacity and annual energy output , this project alone could produce @card@ twh annually , with a @card@ , @card@ mw nameplate capacity . this wind park alone could replace @card@ % of California ' s current carbon emit electric generation.5

@card@ repower 5.0mw turbine

figure @card@ : an example wind park off the northern california coast with average hourly ( pst ) wind speed show on the graph . the wind at @card@ m blow continuously throughout the day , most importantly at peak electricity demand time .

conclusion
despite the steep bathymetry off the california coast , significant development potential exist for offshore wind . by look at the depth of the water more closely , with a high resolution bathymetry dataset , it be possible to find some area that be overlook for offshore wind power development in a previous study . this study also qualitatively look at transmission capacity and population center to build a context for the offshore wind resource in california . we find that northern california have the good @card@ m wind resource but have the least transmission capacity . some of northern california ' S resource could be develop today , use existing turbine support technology . the san francisco bay area however , will more than likely require the development of floating turbine support structure for large scale offshore turbine development . southern california ' s wind resource be significantly reduce during the summer month , due to the location of the pacific high . more in-depth modeling and validation need to be undertake to learn exactly what time of the year and in what location the wind resource subside in southern california . in sum total , base on the @card@ m wind speed cutoff of @card@ m / S and @card@ m / S , between @card@ % and @card@ % respectively of california ' s electricity need could be

provide with offshore wind energy alone [ cec , @card@ ] .

analysis of diffuse augmented wind turbine analysis of diffuse augmented wind turbine Michael Moeller Jr. , and dr. kenneth visser† department of mechanical and aeronautical engineering abstract many different method of alternative energy be be evaluate in order to address the current crisis arise from the depletion of non-renewable resource . wind energy represent a viable alternative , as it be a virtually endless resource . one of the more promising concept in the wind energy field be the development of the diffuse augmented wind turbine ( dawt ) . these configuration use an additional diffuser to improve performance . the dawt geometry concept have be analyze use Clarkson ' s mrotor code with a focus on the wind tame dawt of future energy solution inc of livonia , ny . preliminary calculation base on optimize the original wind tamer geometry , indicate power coefficient peak at Cp = @card@ , use commercial size . an optimization analysis in mrotor have indicate that power coefficient of nearly Cp = @card@ for low wind speed , and even high at fast wind speed , can be achieve with minor design modification . full scale testing of this concept be underway at the clarkson wind turbine test site and will continue for several month . i . introduction / background information it be become necessary to fully understand how to improve wind turbine efficiency , as energy consumption and cost reach record-breaking level . the cost of oil and non-renewable resource be skyrocket , and the depletion of these resource will require a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source . an improvement to wind turbine efficiency will allow the limit of today to be surpass , and someday be able to extract all of the energy from the wind with only a few improvement in technology . a great number of these high-efficiency turbine would lower the cost of energy , power the world for less . one such method of improve turbine efficiency be a diffuse augmented wind turbine ( dawt ) as an improvement to the conventional horizontal axis wind turbine ( hawt ) . dawts be simply a hawt with a trumpet-bell-shaped diffuser surround the rotor blade and extend aft . a dawt be claim to have a great efficiency than conventional hawts , even possibly high than the betz limit , because the diffuser allow for a great pressure drop across the rotor blade . only one dawt have be commercially produce , the Vortec @card@ as see in figure @ord@ dawts offer additional advantage in addition to increase augmentation , include minimal tip speed loss ; a small rotor diameter that increase rpm , and be less yaw sensitive than hawts . however , there be many issue with dawts that need to be address to fully understand them before their great power output can be achieve . one of the most current dawts it the wind tame dawt create by jerry brock of future energy solution inc. of lavonia , ny . this dawt incorporate datum from past researcher , and also include a newly innovative bypass region . figure @card@ : the vortec @card@ diffuser augmented wind turbine . @card@ ii . methodology when design a turbine for any give location , several parameter need to be determine for optimal or near optimal performance . mrotor be a matlab code develop at clarkson university k . visser , m . brown , and m . duquette , which use blade element method ( bem ) to calculate some of these parameter to analyze wind turbine . base on earlier preliminary test perform by engineer from rochester , ny , it be apparent that the wind tamer be not optimize to run at low wind speed . since the average wind speed in potsdam , ny be around @card@ m / s ( a low wind speed ) , the wind tamer performance may not be optimally efficient . use the current geometry and run several test in mrotor , this be confirm to be the case ; so several optimization test be run to suggest design modification to maximize efficiency . these test be categorize by performance augmentation , though the associate cost with these design could potentially harm the cost to power to cost ratio of the wind tamer . full scale testing of the wind tamer concept be in progress at the clarkson wind turbine test site and will continue for several month . datum from testing will be compare to the theoretical calculation . iii . result and discussion from the bem datum , it appear that @card@ blade on the wind tamer would prove to be more beneficial . it be also apparent that if the pitch and twist distribution be to be vary from the original design , augmentation would increase further . another issue address in the table be change of the blade profile to be an airfoil rather than flat plate . flat plate will reduce the efficiency of the wind tamer in field-test ; due to the increase drag flat plate have over airfoil . if a camber airfoil or a symmetric airfoil be use , the aerodynamic efficiency could benefit greatly . since bem seem to underestimate actual performance , it be recommend that the design modification occur that do not attach much additional cost to the wind tamer . figure @card@ : power output vs. blade number for various blade design modification to the wind tamer dawt . figure @card@ illustrate a few change to the design that will increase the output power at a high wind speed , nearly double the original power output . also , since the bem calculation be limit to a free stream rotor , it be expect that the power augmentation would increase even further , by a factor of approximately @card@ base on average take from comparison with preliminary datum . if all of the change be make as suggest , it can be expect that the power output can increase from @card@ watt to @card@ watt , an augmentation of @card@ for the @card@ m / s wind regime . use mrotor , the Cp value expect would be around @card@ for the various optimize airfoil at @card@ m / S . however , this value be associate with the bem calculation , and not the expect power output . therefore , it be expect that the power coefficient of the wind tame dawt at @card@ m / S will be @card@ . in addition , power coefficient appear to be increase as rotor diameter increase , which may augment the power output ever further . base on past research by grumman aerospace and many other , the optimal exit area ratio for a diffuse augmented wind turbine be state to be @card@ to @card@ for economic reason . also a length to diameter ratio have be economically optimize to be @card@ to @card@ for a dawt , and a diffuse angle of @card@ degree . these design change could positively affect the performance of the wind tame dawt to be close to , or beat the betz limit , by a significant margin.1 , @card@ iv . conclude remark from the mrotor analysis , it be suggest that the wind tame dawt be adjust slightly , though theoretical calculation do not always reflect real-world test . with these minor change , performance could be potentially increase to near or great than @card@ time current power output . it be determine that further power augmentation be possible , but no calculation have provide that the dawt will provide power coefficient high than the betz limit . these low power coefficient be also expect accord to the bem calculation because dawt ' s do not run optimally at the same condition as bare-wind turbine . further theoretical research be plan at clarkson university to correct the bem calculation to match the output . experimental research be plan at the clarkson university wind turbine test site on the wind tame dawt to compare theoretical result against the work prototype . further theoretical research be plan at clarkson university to correct the bem calculation in order to match the output from the experimental research . also , further theoretical research be plan at clarkson university to analyze the flow field around a 2d and 3d geometry of the wind tame dawt use cfd calculation . reference @ord@ gilbert , b . and foreman , k . , " experimental demonstration of the diffuse augmented wind turbine concept " , grumman aerospace corp. , bethpage , ny . @ord@ goden , david l . , and eric l . bibeau . ` ` increase power density of kinetic turbine for cost-effective distribute power generation .

news release - may 2nd on shore wind turbine : who be look after public safety ? wind turbine - an accident wait to happen ? the danger to the public from wind turbine be clearly illustrate by the grow number of accident worldwide involve giant turbine catch fire , shed blade or part of blade and throw large ice lump . industrial sized on-shore wind turbine with large rotate blade pose an element of danger to both the public and property in the surrounding area . the fact that these blade rotate at a great height above the ground mean that any failure or partial failure of a blade or fall ice can be project some distance and over a wide area . this danger be increase when turbine be site in close proximity to high voltage electricity line , home and a busy road run in an east to west direction , as in the recent seamer planning application . two recent event in the Uk highlight this grow problem : Whittlesey , lincs , December @card@ @card@ : huge lump of ice be throw onto home and garden from the blade of a giant wind turbine . freeze overnight temperature have cause the ice to form : the turbine do not turn off automatically when the ice start to shed . people have to take cover as lump of ice - some two foot long - shower them from the @card@ metre high turbine tower . the health and safety executive be now investigate the incident , and the local mp be call for a public inquiry . manchester , December @card@ : wind energy developer ecoctricity withdraw plan to erect a wind turbine at manchester city stadium because of a ` ` one in a million ' ' chance of ice throw . they state ` ` we do n't feel that we can accept even this small level of risk . we do n't feel the risk to the public , to the reputation of the club , to ecotricity and to wind energy , be worth taking ' ' . various method of combat the problem be consider , but the project be abandon . present situation the lack of a regulate body to set , monitor and enforce health and safety standard for the wind industry have result in confusion and division of responsibility between the various central and local government body . with no over-all body in charge , none of the party involve accept responsibility for evaluate the danger and carry out a risk assessment . the planning process for commercial wind turbine installation do not require or include an assessment of the risk wind turbine pose to the public and property . those involve in process the developer ' s planning application include the local planning authority , statutory consultees and local councillor on the planning committee . yet , in the case of the seamer application , it appear that only the local councillor on the planning committee be prepare to acknowledge the risk involve . the developer in submit a proposal , wind energy developer be require to comply with plan policy statement @card@ : renewable energy ( pps22 ) . guideline be also give in ` ` plan for renewable energy a companion guide to pps22 ' ' . both the policy statement and the guideline be issue in @card@ and have not be update since then . relevant paragraph of this document be list in appendix @ord@ it be notable that instrumental in the production of the companion guide ( technical annex : wind ) be the British wind energy association , the trade body which look after the interest of wind energy developer . pps22 recognise the " danger to human or animal life " by loss of turbine blade or partial blade and fragment of ice release from the blade , but do not advise how to quantify such danger or how to mitigate against the danger . pps22 also recognise the " shadow flicker and reflect light " effect from a wind turbine but limit this effect to " occur inside building " . it do not consider this effect on user of nearby road . although it acknowledge the risk from wind turbine , pps22 do not require wind energy developer to carry out a risk assessment . this be effectively a loophole for developer , who be well aware of the risk pose by wind turbine . developer use this loophole when respond to query regard risk , merely point out that they have comply with pps22 . however , pps22 be outdate , do not adequately describe the risk associate with modern industrial wind turbine , and be widely criticise by many eminent and professional people . fact : developer do not ass ess the risk to the public local planning authority local planning authority be drive by the government ' S target for renewable energy installation and keen to avoid any penalty impose by government for fail to meet the target impose upon them . local planning authority apply pps22 guideline to determine wind energy planning application . they also engage with statutory consultees , include those with a responsibility for safety , namely highway agency , local highway authority and national grid . however , planning authority do not involve themselves in risk or health and safety issue with regard to wind turbine application . in a presentation to bwea in October @card@ , nick summer of the health and safety executive state : ` ` when developer seek plan permission for a wind farm , potential risk to public safety should be assess within the plan framework process ' ' ` ` some risk to public be well address through plan control as well as h & S legislation ' ' ` ` promotion of clear guideline and their application by plan authority to deal with risk to the public , relevant standard and industry good practice , should minimise risk to the public ' ' clearly , the health and safety executive believe that risk assessment should be within the remit of local planning authority . local authority should therefore incorporate this requirement in their local development framework policy cover wind turbine installation . fact : local planning authority do not assess the risk to the public highway agency the current policy be use by highway agency be network strategy - spatial planning advice note : sp @card@ / @card@ - plan application for wind turbine site near to trunk road . however this policy only apply to motorway and trunk road and be not apply to the majority of plan application for wind turbine . this policy be issue as a work draft in December @card@ , and issue in march @ord@ it be update in july @card@ and be still in use . relevant paragraph of this document be list in appendix1 . this policy recognise the need to locate wind turbine further away from trunk road than the distance recommend in pps22 . the ha recommendation be turbine height plus @card@ metre . with regard to " shadow " or " flicker " it recommend : " ... , a separate , site-specific assessment of risk may be prudent . " when question of safety or risk be raise with the planning authority , they pass these on to the developer . the developer ' S response be , invariably , not to answer such question , but to merely state that the planning application comply with pps22 . the developer be responsible for hazard and risk associate with wind turbine . however , the wind industry be self-regulated and if the developer state that he have comply with pps22 , this be accept by the highway agency and the local planning authority . the identify safety problem or risk associate with trunk road and road user be then not quantify or mitigate against . fact : the highway agency do not asse ss the risk to the public local highway / transport authority the local highway / transport authority do not have policy with regard to wind turbine and rely on their own initiative when respond to planning application which affect their road network . it would seem sensible to utilise the highway agency standard sp @card@ / @card@ listed above but local transport authority choose not to do so . accordingly road user use other than motorway and trunk road be expose to a great level of risk from wind turbine . this be surely illogical , and do not adequately protect the general public . again , if question of safety or risk be raise with the planning authority , they contact the developer , who in turn assure them that the planning application comply with pps22 . if the developer state that he have comply with pps22 , this be accept by the local highway / transport authority and the local planning authority . once again t he identify safety problem or risk associate with road and road user be then not quantify or mitigate against . fact : the local highway / transport authority do not assess the risk to the public national grid the guideline currently use by developer be national grid ( energy network association ) technical specification @card@ for ` ` overhead line clearance ' ' , issue @card@ ( @card@ ) for safe separation to power line . this indicate fall over distance plus @card@ metre but acknowledge that this do not apply to wind turbine . however national grid - internal and contract specific policy statement ( transmission ) issue a new policy entitle " overhead line separation from wind turbine ps ( t ) @card@ - issue @card@ - September @card@ " part @card@ exist overhead line state : " the requirement of @card@ electricity safety , quality and continuity regulation shall be meet in regard to both the nature of the equipment and the surround land use . all possible measure must be make to safeguard exist ohl asset by seek to ensure new wind turbine be construct at a distance more than @card@ time the rotor diameter away from any ohl . " to date , national grid have not apply this policy : they be await supporting datum ( expect in the first quarter of @card@ ) . once finalise , it be expect they will apply this policy to all new wind turbine application . fact : the national grid do not asse ss the risk to the public health and safety executive the health and safety executive play no roll in the plan process for wind turbine in spite of be the statutory body which issue all the policy with regard to safety and risk associate with protect people in the workplace . hse start from the position that : " a suitable and sufficient risk assessment must be undertake to determine the measure need to ensure that risk from the hazard be adequately control . " hse policy : reduce risk protect people - r2p2 would be an appropriate document to evaluate such risk from wind turbine . however , hse policy only come into effect once the construction of the wind turbine commence , and they cover employee on the site rather than the general public in the vicinity of the site . fact : the health and safety executive do not assess the risk to the public summary who be look after public safety ? - no one ! ! ! neither the developer , t he local planning authority , the highway agency , the local highway authority , the national grid nor the health and safety executive assess the risk to the public appendix @card@ - pps22 planning policy statement @card@ : renewable energy ( pps22 ) and plan for renewable energy a companion guide to pps @card@ section @card@ - wind cover safety in paragraph @card@ to51 . paragraph @card@ state : " the only source of possible danger to human or animal life from a wind turbine would be the loss of a piece of the blade or , in most exceptional circumstance , of the whole blade .

abstract : increase level of wind power penetration in modern power system have set intensively high standard with respect to wind turbine technology during the last year . security issue have become rather critical and operation of wind farm as conventional power plant be become a necessity as wind turbine replace conventional unit on the production side . this article include a review of the basic control issue regard the capability of the doubly feed induction generator ( dfig ) wind turbine configuration to fulfill the basic technical requirement set by the system operator and contribute to power system security . an overview of ancillary service provide by wind turbine technology nowadays be provide , i.e. . , fault ride-through capability , reactive power supply and frequency-active power control . keywords : wind turbine ; fault ride-through ; power control ; reactive power ; frequency control

disturbance . wind turbine could be disconnect when abnormal grid voltage behavior be detect . the constantly increase penetration of wind power in the power system over the last year have pose serious concern regard the sudden loss of power during grid fault , which could be cause by wind turbine ´ disconnection , lead possibly to further severe frequency and / or voltage instability . these concern have lead to detailed review of national grid code , which nowadays include a wide range of technical requirement that wind farm must fulfill [ @card@ ] . the operational behavior of wind farm have to follow today the basic guideline , which have be up to now traditionally only refer to conventional power station . in this article the capability of the dfig configuration to fulfill the main technical requirement , common to most national grid code , will be present . the follow wind turbine ancillary service be address and discuss in the article [ @card@ - @card@ ] :  capability to regulate their power production during normal operation - accord to several national grid code , wind farm must be able to regulate their power production to an impose reference value , set remotely or locally [ @card@ ] . the capability of the dfig wind turbine to independently control active and reactive power and provide the corresponding service be assess and emphasize in normal operation condition by mean of simulation . fault ride through ( frt ) capability - the ability of modern wind turbine to withstand low voltage condition , which mostly appear during short circuit fault in the grid , stay connect during the fault and resume their pre-fault normal operation shortly after the fault clearance be essential . advanced design of the wind turbine controller and / or development of new equipment in wind turbine be necessary to enable the wind turbine to fulfill this requirement , which be usually describe in grid code through definition of the duration and the depth of a voltage drop at which the wind turbine be not allow to disconnect . voltage-reactive power control capability - in most grid code wind farm be ask to support the voltage of the power system in normal operation , by provide or absorb reactive power . the reactive power supply capability largely depend on the specific wind turbine technology . variable speed wind turbine scheme , like the dfig study here , be nowadays able to provide additional reactive power through advanced control of their power electronics . some particular grid code , such as e-on Netz and the Spanish one , require voltage support through reactive current injection during fault operation as well . the present paper reveal for instance how a dfig wind turbine equip with a co-ordinate voltage control system can enhance the grid support , even during abnormal voltage condition . frequency-active power control capability - a crucial aspect relate to system stability be active power balance in the system . frequency stability be often seriously threaten during event , i.e. . , sudden load change , trip of a production unit due to protection reason . as wind farm tend to substitute conventional unit in the power system , they be often require to remain connect during frequency variation while in the future they should also contribute actively to the generation control of the system [ @card@ ] . the wind turbine have to adjust their power output accord to frequency deviation although the fluctuate nature of wind pose serious constraint regard the availability of active power . this feature become vital for non interconnect power system , like island system , whose inertia be restrict and frequency variation often lead to severe load shedding .

@card@ . fault ride-through ( frt ) capability accord to the fault ride-through requirement define in most grid code , wind turbine have to remain connect to the grid during voltage dip . the dfig wind turbine configuration be sensitive to grid fault and require special power converter protection , because high inrush stator and rotor current can appear during grid fault . the protection of the converter against overcurrents , but also of the generator rotor and the dc-link against overvoltages , be ensure via the so-called crowbar . in principle , the crowbar be an external rotor impedance , couple via the slip ring to the generator rotor . accord to the strategy implement in this survey , when the crowbar be trigger , the rotor side converter ( rsc ) be disable and bypass , and therefore the independent controllability of active and reactive power be lose . since the grid side converter ( gsc ) be not directly connect to the generator winding , where the high transient current occur , this converter be not block by the protection system during grid fault . when the crowbar be remove , the rsc be enable again to control independently the active and reactive power .

in the case of a grid fault , the power reference be define as the output of a damp controller [ @card@ , @card@ ] . when a fault be detect , the definition of the power reference be thus switch between the normal operation definition ( i.e. . , mpp ) and the fault operation definition ( damp controller ) . figure @card@ depict the control system apply for frt as well as the voltage control , which will be describe in the next section . figure @ord@ control system of the dfig wind turbine for frt and voltage control .

it be worth note that during grid fault , the pitch control system be not able to damp the torsional oscillation , because of several delay mechanism in the pitch [ @card@ ] . the pitch control damp the slow frequency variation in the generator speed , while the damp controller be able to damp the fast oscillation in the generator speed . the effect of the damp controller both on the electrical and the mechanical part of the turbine for a voltage dip down to @card@ % from the rate voltage with @card@ Ms duration be illustrate in figure @ord@ the sudden drop of the voltage lead to drop in the stator and rotor flux , which result in a decrease of the electromagnetic torque . the drive train act as a torsion spring and get untwisted during fault and consequently the mechanical torque drop too . however , the mechanical torque drop slow than the electromagnetic torque and therefore the generator start to accelerate . the effect of the damp controller , which act directly on the active power reference signal , be very crucial . this controller damp actively the torsional excitation in the drive train system follow the grid fault . when no damp controller be use , both the oscillation in the mechanical torque and in the generator speed remain undamped and would cause severe mechanical stress in the drive train , possibly lead to disconnection of the wind turbine by the protection system . the comparison reveal the positive effect of the damp controller on the response of the wind turbine .

after fault clearing , when the voltage at the converter terminal re-establish , the gsc be able to provide even more reactive power to the grid . due to the reactive power demand of the generator , when the fault be clear , the voltage do not completely recover immediately . the generator operate

as describe in [ @card@ , @card@ ] , the response of a dfig wind turbine be very different than of asig wind turbine . its inertial be mostly base on the apply control scheme act on the converter connect the rotor to the grid . supplementary control attribute have be propose in the literature in order to achieve active frequency control by variable speed wind turbine [ @card@ , @card@ ] . in this article two different frequency control method be present for the dfig wind turbine configuration :   inertia control droop control

@card@

when inertia control be use , the inertial response of the dfig be restore through an additional loop in the power reference block provide the active power reference signal to the rotor side converter , ( see figure @card@ ) . the dfig wind turbine be order to adjust its power output when subject to frequency deviation , base on the measurement of the rate of change of the frequency . this define the additional power reference signal , which be add to the normal power reference provide by the mpp tracking controller [ @card@ ] . in droop control , the auxiliary input signal that define the adjustment in the power production of the wind turbine be the actual error between the measure frequency of the system and the nominal frequency . this control method be similar to the primary frequency control apply to conventional generator . figure @ord@ frequency control scheme for the dfig wind turbine configuration .

notice that when no auxiliary frequency control be apply , the frequency drop below @card@ hz , lead to load shedding which prevent further frequency drop . in the other two case , where the frequency control be activate in the dfig wind farm , the load shedding be totally avoid . the optimum frequency drop in term of minimum frequency be achieve through droop control . the effect of auxiliary frequency control on the maximum rate of change of frequency be very crucial . as illustrate in figure @card@ , the initial rate of change of frequency be very high . the inertia of the system in this case be low because the number of the conventional generator connect to the system be reduce . the rate of change of frequency be close to @card@ hz / sec ( in absolute value ) when no auxiliary control be apply . inertia control manage to reduce the rate to @card@ hz / sec , while droop control do not affect this rate . figure @card@ illustrate also the change in the active power output of the wind farm during the frequency deviation for each one of the implement method . @ord@ conclusion increase penetration level of wind power demand constant development in the field of wind turbine technology . this article assess and illustrate modeling issue for variable speed dfig wind turbine regard ancillary service provide to the grid , during both normal operation and transient event . the converter control be enhance to provide with active and reactive power regulation capability . an active crowbar protection system be include in the protection system , ensure safe operation of the wind turbine during severe voltage dip , which occur in the power system e.g. . due to fault . uninterrupted operation be ensure and dfig wind turbine be able to support the grid immediately after the fault clearance , supplement with reactive power . possible oscillation which may occur during transient event can be damp through an additional damp controller . voltage and reactive power control be possible when coordinate control be apply between the grid side converter and the rotor side converter . thus , dfig wind turbine contribute significantly to system stability in case of reactive power imbalance in the power system . auxiliary frequency control make it possible for such wind turbine to participate in the primary control service of the system during frequency event , e.g. . sudden loss of production . power electronic technology enable nowadays wind turbine to be active component of power system and participate in the major service traditionally serve by conventional power plant . this article assess the main control function which enable the dfig wind turbine configuration to contribute to safe and secure operation of modern power system .

the European parliament have for many year be call for a mandatory @card@ % target for renewable energy by @ord@ the gradual implementation of the @card@ renewable electricity directive in the member state , as well as the European council ' s unanimous decision for a @card@ % share of renewable energy in the eu by @card@ at its spring summit in march @card@ , be all step in the right direction and indicator of increase political commitment . the share of renewable energy need to go up from @card@ % in @card@ to @card@ % in @card@ , which mean that more than one third of the eu ' S electricity will need to come from renewables , up from @card@ % . it be already clear that wind energy will be the large contributor to the increase . the @card@ % target , combine with the dramatic increase in fossil fuel price experience since our @card@ analysis indicate that the long-term future for wind power remain promising and that europe could achieve @card@ gw of wind power capacity by @card@ if regulatory uncertainty can be minimise . the European commission5 expect a @card@ % decline in eu oil production between @card@ and @ord@ gas production will fall by @card@ % and coal by @card@ % . by @card@ , the eu will be import @card@ % of its oil , @card@ % of its gas and @card@ % of its coal . europe can go a long way towards an energy supply that be superior to the business-as-usual scenario , offer great energy independence , low energy cost , reduce fuel price risk , improve competitiveness and more technology export . over the come @card@ year , wind energy will play a major role in that development . the follow table show the wind industry ' S target for the eu-27 in @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ in term of installed capacity . they also demonstrate what this means in term of electricity supply , co2 saving , avoid fuel cost and investment in wind energy machinery .

there be @card@ mw of wind power capacity install per @card@ , @card@ km2 of land area in the eu ( fig . @card@ ) . not surprisingly , be a small country , wind power density be high in denmark but germany be a close second . it be interesting that Spain ' s wind power density be less than half that of germany , indicate a large remain potential - at least from a visual perspective . the netherlands , portugal and luxembourg be also above the eu average . many geographically large member state , e.g. . france , Sweden , Finland , poland and italy , still have very low density relative to the first-mover country . if Sweden have the same wind power density as germany , there would be more than @card@ gw of wind power capacity install in Sweden ( @card@ gw be operate by end @card@ ) and france would have more than @card@ gw of wind power capacity ( compare to @card@ gw in December @card@ ) . the total installed capacity of wind power by the end of @card@ will , in an average wind year , avoid the emission of @card@ Mt of co2 . figure @card@ show the co2 avoid due to turbine install by end @card@ as percentage of the member state ' @card@ greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emission ( the base-year of the Kyoto protocol ) . it assume that wind power displace the average eu amount of co2 per kwh .

however , caution must be apply when interpret the result , since one kwh of wind power avoid far more co2 in for example poland , where the share of coal power production be much high than the eu average , and avoid far less in for example france , where wind power mainly replace gas at the intermediate load . overall , the wind power capacity install by the end of @card@ avoid the emission of @card@ Mt of co2 , of which @card@ be avoid in the eu-15 which have a common obligation under the kyoto protocol of cut ghg emission by @card@ % compare to @card@ level . the new member state have individual target ( exclude malta and cyprus which have no obligation ) . the wind power install in the eu-15 by the end of @card@ reduce co2 emission by @card@ % of @card@ ghg emission , equal to @card@ % of the bloc ' s kyoto obligation .

co2 reduction from wind power
there be different way of calculate wind energy ' s co2 avoidance and the result depend on the assumption make about which fuel be displace when wind electricity be produce . the energy mix and base load differ between member state , so ideally wind power ' S avoid co2 emission should be base on the energy mix at the intermediate load in each member state . here , it be assume that wind energy avoid co2 at the intermediate load but at the average eu-27 generation . operate nuclear power be rather inflexible and can not easily be regulate up and down . hence , wind power do not displace operate nuclear production , except during scheduled and unscheduled nuclear shutdown and if nuclear capacity be decommission . neither do wind energy replace hydropower because hydropower resemble a storage technology for electricity . electricity from hydro that be displace when wind power be operate will be save for production later but total production from hydro be constant over time . for the eu as a whole it be assume that each kwh of wind power displace a kwh define by the energy mix of coal , oil and gas at the time of production . this approach underestimate wind energy ' s co2 avoidance because wind energy in reality avoid the most expensive and co2 intense production rather than the average production mix . naturally , the eu energy mix will change during the period up to @ord@ accord to @card@ iea datum , oil , gas and coal power station produce @card@ , @card@ twh in @card@ and emit @card@ , @card@ Mt of co2 . consequently , one twh produce by wind energy save @card@ mt co2 / twh . the same approach be apply to iea ' S datum for @card@ , @card@ and @card@ and a linear variation be assume in the intermediate year . use this approach it be assume that wind energy in @card@ , will avoid @card@ mt co2 / twh . in @card@ , wind energy avoid @card@ Mt of co2 . in ewea ' s reference scenario , annual co2 avoid from wind energy will increase to @card@ Mt in @card@ , @card@ Mt in @card@ and @card@ Mt in @card@ .

fuel be not require to produce wind power . when wind energy be produce , it save significant amount of fuel cost in the form of coal , gas and oil that would otherwise have be need for power production . in addition to these avoid cost , the production of wind energy reduce demand for import fuel ( and thereby the cost of fuel ) while reduce the rate of depletion of europe ' S remain fossil fuel reserve . naturally , the avoid fuel cost of wind energy depend on the assumption make about future fuel price . oil and gas price be very closely link , and coal also follow - to a lesser extent - the price of oil . both the iea and the European commission have for many year make prediction on future coal , gas and oil price , and most government base their energy policy on the iea ' s fuel price scenario . historically , the iea and European commission scenario have be similar , and both institution have be very consistent in underestimate the future fuel price . @card@ start with the price of oil reach a record $ @card@ a barrel . the international energy agency ( iea ) , predict that the oil price will fall to $ @card@ in @ord@ in @card@ , the iea predict that oil would cost $ @card@ a barrel in @card@ , $ @card@ in @card@ and $ @card@ in @card@ ( in year-2000 dollar ) . fig . @card@ show the late oil price estimate from the European commission ( @card@ ) and the iea ( @card@ ) , and an alternative oil price scenario from ewea . as the figure show , the European commission believe that the price of oil in @card@ will be approx . @card@ % low than today ( app . $ @card@ in January @card@ ) while the iea estimate a drop in the price of oil to $ @card@ three year from now . , both institution believe that the price of oil in @card@ will be approx . $ @card@ a barrel - @card@ % low than today . nobody can predict oil price , but it should be a minimum requirement that the European commission and the iea include fuel price sensitivity analysis in their scenario for the future development of the energy market .

one of the significant benefit of wind power be that the fuel be free . therefore , the total cost of produce wind energy throughout the @card@ to 25-year lifetime of a wind turbine can be predict with great certainty . neither the future price of coal , oil or gas , nor the price of carbon , will significantly affect the cost of wind power production . in order to calculate the wind power investment need to reach ewea ' s reference scenario , it be necessary to make assumption on the future development of the cost of installed wind power capacity . for some year , it have be assume as a rule of thumb that installed wind power capacity cost approx . € @card@ , @card@ / kw . that be probably still a valid rule of thumb . however , since @card@ there have be quite large variation in the price ( not necessarily the cost ) of install wind power capacity . in the period @card@ to @card@ , the global market for wind power capacity grow less than expect ( see page @card@ ) and create a surplus in wind turbine production capacity . consequently , the price of wind power capacity go down dramatically - for some project € @card@ / kw . in the past three year - @card@ to @card@ - the global market for wind energy have increase by @card@ % annually , and demand for wind turbine have surge , lead to increase in price . the European commission , in its renewable energy roadmap20 , assume that onshore wind energy cost € @card@ / kw in @card@ ( in € @card@ ) . it assume that cost will drop to € @card@ / kw in @card@ and € @card@ / kw in @ord@ that long term cost curve may still apply for a situation where there be a good balance between demand and supply for wind turbine than at the present time . fig . @card@ show the European commission ' S assumption on the development of onshore and offshore wind power capacity cost up to @ord@ in addition , there be two curve that reflect the effect of the demand / supply on wind turbine price in recent year . ewea assume onshore wind energy price of € @card@ , @card@ / kw in @card@ ( € @card@ price ) and offshore price of € @card@ , @card@ / kw . the steep increase in offshore cost reflect the limited number of manufacturer in the offshore market , the current absence of economy of scale due to low market deployment and bottleneck in the supply chain .

energy investment and total avoid lifetime cost

so far , this report have look at wind energy ' s contribution to electricity , co2 reduction , avoid fuel cost , etc . from a perspective of total installed capacity by the end of each individual year . in this chapter a life-time approach be use , in order to determine how much co2 and fuel cost be avoid from wind power investment make in a give year over the entire life-time of the capacity . for example , chapter @card@ demonstrate that the @card@ gw of wind power capacity install in the eu in @card@ will avoid the emission of @card@ Mt / co2 in @ord@ what have not be take into account so far in this report be that the wind energy capacity install , e.g. . the @card@ gw that will be install during the year @card@ , will continue to produce electricity , avoid co2 and fuel cost beyond @card@ - some co2 and fuel cost will be avoid right up to @ord@ fig . @card@ show the total co2 cost and fuel cost avoid during the lifetime of the wind energy capacity install for each of the year @card@ , assume a technical lifetime for onshore wind turbine of @card@ year and for offshore wind turbine of @card@ year . furthermore , it be assume that wind energy avoid an average of @card@ g co2 / kwh produce ; that the average price of a co2 allowance be € @card@ / t and that € @card@ million worth of fuel be avoid for each twh of wind power produce , equivalent to an oil price throughout the period of $ @card@ per barrel . for example , the @card@ , @card@ mw of wind power capacity that be install in the eu in @card@ have an investment value of € @card@ billion , will avoid co2 emission worth € @card@ billion throughout its lifetime and fuel cost of € @card@ billion throughout its lifetime , assume an average co2 price of € @card@ / t and average fuel price ( gas , coal and oil ) base on $ @card@ / barrel of oil . similarly , the € @card@ billion of investment in wind power between @card@ and @card@ will avoid € @card@ billion worth of co2 and € @card@ billion in fuel cost under the same assumption . for the period up to @card@ , wind power investment of € @card@ billion will avoid € @card@ billion in co2 cost and € @card@ billion worth of fuel .

it be important to note that these calculation only compare the capital cost of wind energy to avoid co2 and fuel cost . the operation and maintenance cost ( low because the fuel be free ) have not be take into account . in addition , it would be reasonable to assume that some component of the wind turbine would need replace during their technical lifetime . this have not be take into account either . the purpose be to compare the investment value in an individual year with the avoid fuel and co2 cost over the lifetime of the wind turbine .

as can be see from fig . @card@ , fig . @card@ and the table below , change the co2 and fuel price assumption have a dramatic impact on the result . with low co2 price ( € @card@ / t ) and fuel price ( equivalent of $ @card@ / barrel of oil ) throughout the period , the wind power investment over the next @card@ year avoid € @card@ billion instead of € @card@ billion . with high price for co2 ( € @card@ / t ) and fuel ( equivalent to $ @card@ / barrel of oil ) wind power would avoid fuel and co2 cost equal to more than € @card@ trillion over the three decade from @card@ to @ord@ the following table show the different saving make depend on the price of oil ( per barrel ) and co2 ( per tonne ) .

type of operation

the electrical energy produce by the wpp can either be use for partial or complete satisfaction of the operator ' s own energy need , or can be feed , completely or partially , into an existing net . the wpp be operate automatically by an operation control system . the relatively high plant performance regard the give rotor diameter be determine by the design of the component . in order to achieve this high rate performance at a reasonable wind speed , the advantage of an infinite variability of the revolution be utilize . however , the relatively high revolving speed of the blade tip within the rate performance range cause a high noise level . such noise be generally absorb by the environmental sound occur in connection with the nominal wind speed anyways , and will not be noticable separately . in case where such noise can not be tolerate due to the fact that the wpp be locate in close neighborhood to residential area , it be possible to reduce the the number of revolution . in such a case , the wpp reach its rate performance at high wind speed but run at a ` ` whisper ' ' level which make up for the yield loss . the variant a , b and c reflect the different mode of operation , with a represent operation with the high and c with the low thinkable number of revolution . variant b represent a randomly choose mode between both extreme . the appropriate mode of operation be determine before the plant be put into operation , namely by set the respective parameter in the operation control software in the computer . for the operator , it be possible to change these setting at any time within the range between both extreme a and c . the safety of the wpp be constantly monitor by the safety system . all function relevant for safety be of a fail-safe design . local manual operation be possible . a remote system ensure monitor of the wpp from a stationary or mobile operation center . also from there , unrestricted manual operation be possible . in the event of error , the wpp remedy them independently to the extent it be capable of . temporary error , such as main failure which lead to a shut-down of the plant , be analyze and document by the wpp and report to the control center . after remedy of the error the wpp re-starts operation automatically . the same procedure be follow in the event of permanent error or in case the safety system have respond . an automatic re-start , however , be not perform in such case . @card@ general description of the wind power plant

in the first step , the rotor of the wpp convert the kinetic energy of the move air mass into mechanical energy . this energy be directly transport to a hydraulic pump which convert it into hydraulic fluid energy . after conversion into fluid energy , a hydraulic motor re-converts the energy into drive mechanical energy , which be finally convert into electrical energy by the electrical generator . in order to adapt the aerodynamic property of the rotor to the individual mode of operation in an optimal manner , especially with regard to the give wind speed , the wpp operate with variable

when design the hydraulic system , special attention have be pay to the absolute tightness of all connection and a complete return of leak oil to the tank . the select design of all fitting and component comply with these requirement . moreover , application of biologically decomposable hydraulic oil brand have be ensure . seal and hose have be select accordingly . @card@ electrical generator

the electrical generator convert the mechanical drive energy of the hydraulic motor into electrical energy . a brushless rotary current synchronous motor with a rotate energize system be apply . energize of the generator be control by the operation control system during the production process in compliance with the purpose . the same apply when asynchronizing it to an existing power grid and / or to other wpp ' S or electrical generator . during the production process the generator work at a fix speed . this be do completely independently of the speed of the rotor of the wpp . the require control of the hydraulic motor to this effect , depend on the volume flow , be perform automatically by the operation control system . @card@ lateral angle system

the lateral angle system consist of the tower head bearing , the brake disk , the lateral angle adjust device and the lateral angle brake . the lateral angle system of the wpp have the function to place the rotor at right angle to the respective wind direction as exactly as possible . to this effect , the entire machine pod be rotate in the tower head bearing by mean of the lateral angle adjust device . the lateral angle adjust device and the lateral angle brake serve to fix the rotor in its optimally align position before the wind . the problem of alignment of the rotor before the wind constitute one of the most difficult problem of the wind energy technology and have be solve by conventional plant technology only in a preliminary and poor manner . with the two-blade rotor , however , an optimal solution have become possible . when rotate and expose to an angular airflow , the two-blade rotor , in contrast , for example , to the three-blade rotor , develop yaw moment rotate in a sine-shaped manner . this mean that , with the rotor rotate and depend on the give rotor position , both leeward and windward yaw moment act on the tower head . this would lead to a continuous swivel movement of the machine pod around its zero position before the wind when the rotor be expose to a horizontal angular airflow . however , the rotor be secure against such swivel movement : the yaw moment do not occur when the rotor be expose to an exactly right-angles airflow , and the machine pod will remain in its optimal position even if the lateral angle brake be bleed . the problem would be solve in an optimal manner , if it be possible to make use of these rotorinitiated moment , especially of the windward one , to adjust the rotor ' s lateral angle in a plant save way , mean to practically take advantage of the angular airflow itself which act on the entire rotor blade in an integral way , and not , as be the case with conventional wpp ' S , to rely on the

by operation control , we generally understand a procedure design on the basis of the specific design datum of the wpp , which allow for the effective and safe operation of the wpp as troublefree as possible and expose to as little load as possible . operation of the wpp be control by an operation control system base on a decentral control concept . fibreoptic cable be use as transmission medium for the serial signal of the system between tower bottom and pod . the operation control system be design to control , regulate and monitor the wpp . it ensure operation of the wpp under all thinkable inner and outer condition in the standard range of operation . @card@ safety concept and safety system

the safety system serve to secure the plant ' S behaviour stipulate in the safety concept , in the case of malfunction . it ensure a safe state of the wpp even in case of malfunction under all thinkable inner and outer condition . the safety system precede the operation control system logically . it react after safety-relevant limit have be exceed or if the operation control system be not or no longer able to keep the wpp within the standard range of operation , and thus also upon a complete failure of the operation control system . the operation control system on its part be able to activate the safety system a priori in case it be no lang able to ensure operation of the wpp under all thinkable inner and outer condition within

the standard range of operation , if it recognize this state and be still able to activate the safety system . @card@ production process

the production process comprise that part of operation of the wpp in which electrical energy beyond the wpp ' s own need be generate and feed into the grid or to the consumer . generally , this happen in the wind speed range of @card@ ms-1 to @card@ ms-1 at hub height . this work range be reasonably subdivide into derate load range and rate load range since the wpp behave differently in each of these two sub-ranges . @card@ production in the derate load range

in the derate load range , the wpp operate below its rating . in this sub-range , the control have to ensure that the wpp produce energy at the well thinkable degree of efficiency . this be do first of all by variation of the rotor speed accord to the respective wind speed and by constant optimal alignment of the rotor within the lateral angle . @card@ production in the rate load range

in the rate load range , the wpp have to reduce its aerodynamic efficiency at a wind speed of @card@ ms-1 to @card@ ms-1 at hub height . this be do by a define reduction of the rotor speed . the controller of the rotor speed react directly , immediately and undelayed to the respective wind speed . alignment of the rotor within the lateral angle be do in a more restrained manner than in the derate load range as long as the rate output be achieve even upon lateral airflow and this lateral airflow do not cause inadmissable load to the wpp . @card@ shut-down of the wpp

regular shut-down of the wpp from production be do if - the energy amount available from the wind be small than the minimum energy amount necessary for economic operation of the wpp . except where minimum supply to the consumer be preferred , neglect the cost . - the wind speed at hub height exceed a wind speed of @card@ ms-1 , which be the threshold value for a shut-down . - the operation control system perform the shut-down due to a defect / error , load relief or other irregularity in the operation of the wpp . regular shut-down of the wpp be do by regulate the generator down through a control reduction of the rotor speed up to its complete standstill and disconnect it from the grid subsequently . if the plant need to be secure against storm , or if it be expect that storm secure will become necessary , the rotor , upon shut-down , be to be put in the so-called final brake position , i . e . with the rotor blade in a horizontal position . in this position , the rotor be hold by the emergency brake over an unlimited period of time .

if the wpp be switch off at ambient temperature below @card@ ° c due to low wind or a defect , it must be ensure for a subsequent re-start that the rotor can start in idle run , which mean that it only have to overcome the frictional moment of rotor bearing and hydraulic pump support . to this effect , the piston of the hydraulic pump be to be press into their rearmost stop position during the last rotor revolution and hold in this position . the entire hydraulic oil flow back into the tank automatically through open valve , and the pump be empty . @card@ @card@ operation control in special situation start-up upon extremely low temperature

the wpp be design for operation at ambient temperature down to -400c . this be ensure through an appropriate design of all component , the use of adequate material , and the use of synthetic biological oil brand in the hydraulic system . if the wpp produce energy at extremely low ambient temperature , there will hardly ever be problem due to the occur heat loss . however , the situation will be more difficult if the wpp be switch off and cool down , and its own temperature fall down to the extreme ambient value while in a standstill . for a start-up of the wpp in such a situation it be important to set the rotor in motion successfully . the small the counter moment against the rotor revolution , the easy this will be possible . this be the point at which the hydrostatic main drive become invaluably advantegous compare to conventional drive , as it allow for a start-up in idle run . to this effect , there be no feed pressure apply to the hydraulic pump , which be completely empty upon shut-down , so that its piston stay in the rearmost neutral position and can not be operate . only if the rotor be move at the small speed , feed pressure be be build up very slowly by pre-heated oil . this pressure put the piston in their work position in a progressive manner . the increase volume flow be use for a further heating-up of the steadily increase oil amount until the system have reach the minimum temperature necessary for a regular connection of the wpp . @card@ secure against storm

the wpp be secure against storm by place the rotor in a horizontal position . in this position , the rotor blade do not overtop the machine pod and can not exert any force , which would be augment by leverage , on the tower head . the rotor blade be hold in their horizontal position for storm secure purpose under all circumstance as long as storm secure be necessary . due to the apply type of emergency brake ( spring-operated , hydraulically bleed ) this be possible over an unlimited period of time .

installation of the plant

installation of the plant will be possible without any crane if there be sufficient personnel available for mount . the one thing that be typical for the installation of the plant be that the tower , after pre-assembly , can be erect together with machine pod and rotor blade out of its horizontal position . regard the statics , the result load on the tower have be include in the calculation as installation load case . a complete description of the installation of the plant be contain in the document ` ` high-performance wind power plant innova 150kw , instruction on plant installation ' ' , document no . @card@ . the tower segment be place on block so as to lie on the ground . subsequently , the two segment be screw together to one unit by mean of an internal flange . afterwards , the tower be connect with the prepared foundation section , which should be in a set condition and ready to be load , by mean of a hinge . then the machine pod , without the generator assembly , be screw to the tower head such that the rotor hub point downwards . the block underneath the tower be to be arrange in a way which provide the necessary space for installation . afterwards , the two rotor blade be screw together with the hub . in order to erect the tower and the pod , mount on the ground in the describe way , one or more pull device , for example , with a minimum pull force of @card@ , @card@ kn be require . if the ground condition be normal , this will equal two truck / lorry load with @card@ kn or more . upon erection , attention be to be pay to a constant , jerk-free pull . the use of a capstan device would be the ideal case . the hinge provide at the tower bottom be necessary for erection . it be remove after set up and can be use again for further installation . after the tower have be set up , the generator assembly be lift upwards inside the tower from down on the ground use a lifting device and , subsequently , connect with the machine support by screw it to its bottom from below . at this stage , the conncetion cable be already connect with the generator and be lift upwards together with it . installation of the wpp in the place of service be complete after the necessary pre-assembled hydraulic connection to the hydraulic motor and the electical connection have be establish . now the wpp be ready to be start for trial operation .

maintenance

in favor of an economically reasonable plant concept , the wpp be design such that , provide the prescribed maintenance interval be observe and the design-owed scheduled preventive maintenance ( spm ) measure be perform , a minimum service life of @card@ year in the place of reference accord to the renewable energy act ( rea ) be most likely to be achieve . this service life can be further increase if , after ascertainment of state , a general overhaul be perform upon completion of the 25th year of the minimum service life . afterwards , the subsequent maintenance cycle and schedule preventive maintenance measure have to be re-determined . the concept of scheduled preventive maintenance determine the design of the wpp from the outset . its component be , unlike with conventional wind energy technology , no longer design to last for the entire life time of the plant regard their fatigue strength , but only for a period between two spm measures1 . this lead to a significant reduction of the investment cost at almost the same operate cost and enable the desire and require life time of the wpp to become reality indeed . in order to ensure that the operate cost of the plant do not increase or increase only slightly by the performance of spm , it have be secure by constructive measure that replacement of the individual component can be carry out by the maintenance personnel quickly , without problem and without any additional auxiliary mean such as crane or lifting device . moreover , it have be ensure that the replace component can be recondition at a reasonable price and reuse as replacement , if possible1 . for maintenance and overhaul measure , no additional auxiliary mean be require except those tool and auxiliary available to the service technician . @card@ maintenance cycle

in the course of one year of opration , maintenance should be carry out twice . the range of work be such that two technician will need @card@ work day to perform . @card@ scheduled preventive maintenance

in interval of @card@ year , start @card@ year after commission , one of the two yearly maintenance measure will be replace by scheduled preventive maintenance . the range of work comprise , among other , replacement of the hydraulic pump , the main hydraulic system include all hose connection , and the generator unit with hydraulic motor , coupling and generator . the time between the schedule preventive maintenance measure may be reduce or extend depend on the actual operate condition . whether reduction or extension apply can be take from the record of the diagnosis , resource and performance control system . this system constantly check and register the actual number of load change and their amplitude , from which the actual dissipation of resource be derive . depend on these conclusion , the time between two subsequent scheduled preventive maintenance measure can be either reduce or extend . however , the regular maintenance interval be not affect by this .

title of report assessment of potential improvement in large-scale low wind speed technology assessment of potential improvement in large-scale low wind speed technology global windpower @card@ march @card@ , @card@ @card@ : 40am - @card@ : 00pm improvement in blade and low wind speed technology technical track joseph m . Cohen Princeton energy resource international @card@ rockville pike , suite @card@ rockville , md @card@ jcohen @ replaced-dns replaced-dns abstract a probabilistic methodology be present to examine technology advance in large-scale , low wind speed turbine over the next @card@ year . the paper first present a reference set of performance and capital and operate cost characteristic for wind plant , use a composite of leading-edge @card@ technology . it next define a set of technology improvement opportunity ( tio ) that may lead to lower levelized cost of energy ( Coe ) . a preliminary set of quantitative estimate of improvement to Coe equation input ( e.g. . , turbine cost , net annual energy ) be make for each tio . result be then present from a probabilistic approach to evaluate coes for possible turbine technology configuration , or " pathway , " result from successful implementation of all possible combination of those improvement . this approach capture the uncertainty of both r & d outcome ( potential size of various improvement ) and the probability of achieve any improvement , ( r & d ` ` success ' ' ) , regardless of the improvement size . introduction the president ' s management agenda require that government organization adopt and maintain a strong focus on achieve result , and not on just carry out process . the u.s. department of energy ' S ( doe ' S ) wind energy research program have respond to this requirement by develop a program planning tool that prioritizes program activity , and assess their continue contribution to the achievement of program goal . the program pursue this management agenda through two parallel activity . first , the program have an on-going technical assessment activity - to monitor the current status of wind technology and progress in achieve program cost goal , to evaluate that status within the context of the need of the marketplace , and to identify technological pathway that will lead to wind ' s successful competition in the marketplace . second , the program also use a formal peer review process - to benefit from the guidance of industry and the research community , and to provide an outside view of the program . technical assessment and peer review provide input that the program management team consider in make decision about strategic program direction and funding priority . the program goal for low wind speed technology be to achieve @card@ ¢ / kwh in land-based class @card@ wind site ( @card@ m / S at @card@ m above ground ) and 5¢ / kwh in class @card@ shallow water offshore site by @ord@ at the core of the strategic planning framework be a wind technology pathway model develop by princeton energy resource international , llc , ( peri ) , under subcontract to the national renewable energy laboratory ( nrel ) . an important objective of the pathway model be to demonstrate that there be sufficient opportunity for wind technology to be improve , through program-sponsored r & d , such that the goal of the program can , in fact , be achieve . a second objective of the pathway model be to explore the implication of program success in meeting goal if a particular research project do not yield the expect technology improvement benefit . this paper represent the view of the author and do not necessarily state or reflect those of the unite state government or any agency thereof . technology pathway analysis the technology pathway analysis can be describe as a 5-step process , as show in figure @ord@ the overall metric use by the program to set goal for technology improvement , and to track subsequent progress in r & d towards those goal , be the levelized cost of energy ( Coe ) . cost levelization be the conversion of a stream of vary actual annual project cost to a stream of equal ( level ) annual cost that have the same present value as the present value of the actual cost stream . Coe depend partly on value for annual energy capture , and wind plant initial capital cost and annual expense , include operation and maintenance cost , sink fund payment for periodic ( long-term ) replacement or major component overhaul , land lease payment , and other expense such as tax and insurance . calculation of Coe also involve assumption for several financial factor such as the cost of money , require investor rate of return , project debt-to-equity ratio and other lender requirement , the assumed project operational life , and the annual wind energy available at the site . while not include in the pathway analysis , federal and state incentive and the delivery point for electricity can also significantly affect the Coe . a full discussion of the Coe methodology and assumption may be find in attachment c of the nrel low wind speed turbine ( lwst ) project solicitation , October @ord@ figure @ord@ wind technology path analysis process Coe in the pathway analysis be express in constant , january @card@ dollar . it be calculate for a @card@ mw ( rate ) wind power plant , with an expect life of @card@ year , and a class @card@ wind resource ( assume @card@ m / sec at @card@ meter above ground , a wind shear exponent of @card@ , and a rayleigh distribution , i.e. . , a weibull k factor = @card@ ) use the follow equation : Coe = ( fcr x icc ) + aoe aep where : Coe ( levelized cost of energy ( $ / kwh ) ( constant dollar ) fcr ( fix charge rate ( constant dollar ) = ( @card@ ) icc ( initial capital cost ( overnight $ ) = [ turbine capital cost ( tcc ) + balance of station cost ( bos ) ] aep ( net annual energy production ( kwh / Yr ) aoe ( annual operate expense ( llc+ ( o & m + lrc ) aep llc ( land lease cost ( $ / kwh ) o & m ( after-tax , levelized o & m cost ( $ / Yr multiply by ( @card@ tax rate = @card@ ) lrc ( levelized major replacement and overhaul cost ( $ / Yr ) the initial capital cost be an overnight cost , i.e. . , it do not include construction financing , which typically add between @card@ $ / kw and @card@ $ / kw . the fix charge rate be the annual amount per dollar of initial capital cost need to cover the capital cost , a return on debt and equity , and various other fix charge . this rate be impute from a hypothetical project , assume generation company ( genco ) , or balance sheet , financing , model with peri ' s fate2-p pro forma cash flow spreadsheet model . specifically , it include construction financing , financing fee , return on debt and equity , depreciation , income tax , property tax and insurance . for the Coe calculation , an impute constant dollar fcr = @card@ be use . the 10-year section @card@ renewable energy production tax credit be not include in the fix charge rate . to allow tracking of technology advance absent from change in financial parameter and other assumption , the follow be treat as the only input variable in the Coe equation for the turbine pathway analysis ; all other input and assumption be fix : turbine capital cost ( tcc ) balance of station cost ( bos ) annual operation and maintenance cost ( o & m ) levelized replacement and overhaul cost ( lrc ) net annual energy production ( aep ) reader be caution that the coe calculate for this analysis be not the same value as the coe that would be calculate in the current market . first , commercial coes be state in current dollar , which include the effect of inflation , make the commercial coe typically about @card@ ¢ / kwh to @card@ ¢ / kwh high than the constant dollar equivalent . second , the federal production tax credit ( @card@ ¢ / kwh for the first @card@ year ) be not include . third , the fcr assume a relatively high required rate of return compare to current market rate and be therefore high than one might use to characterize Coe in the current financial climate . however , it be reasonable given historical experience , and consistent with the goal of this analysis - to track and project change in Coe result from technology development , not financial condition . the reader be also caution that the levelized coeis not the same as a bid price , which might include escalator . step @card@ - characterize reference turbine in order to project improvement in cost , performance , and reliability on wind turbine system and wind plant use the pathway model , a baseline , or reference , set of cost and performance characteristic for the five variable list above must first be develop . these characteristic serve as the input to a reference coe from which all technical improvement be measure . the reference technology characteristic for doe ' s ongoing low wind speed technology pathway analysis effort be derive primarily from the baseline turbine design develop under the recent windpact ( wind partnership for advanced component technology ) project . [ @card@ ] that baseline represent a composite of the most advanced wind energy technology available in @ord@ nominally , it represent a 3-bladed , up-wind , variable pitch , variable speed turbine use a doubly-fed generator rate at @card@ , @card@ kw . the rotor diameter be @card@ meter and the tower height be @card@ meter . the reference characteristic be also consistent with several lead commercial turbine from the major manufacturer in @ord@ that date be select as the reference because it be when the doe low wind speed turbine program be initiate . because the purpose of the pathway analysis be to examine lead edge technology , it be important that the reference turbine represent the current status of such technology . the analysis characterize cost assume a @card@ mw wind plant , to take advantage of economy of scale in procurement and installation . analysis of @card@ confidential power purchase agreement for project install over the past @card@ year show a strong correlation between project size and capital cost . further , cost estimate assume favorable installation and maintenance condition consistent with large area of class @card@ wind in the unite state ( i.e. . , relatively flat land , easy access , and soil conducive to foundation and large installation crane ) . together , these assumption create a capital cost estimate towards the low end of the range typically report for commercial project . table @card@ summarize estimated input datum for the reference wind Coe calculation . datum be show as a range from minimum to maximum , with an expect value in-between . those three data point create a triangular distribution for each variable , as illustrate in figure @ord@ the wind pathway analysis model use a monte carlo sample approach to randomly sample , and then combine the result value from , each input distribution in the Coe equation . the model perform this sample exercise over a large number of iteration to create a distribution of all possible result value . use the input from table @card@ , the model calculate a reference wind turbine project with a mean ( i.e. . , @card@ % chance ) Coe of @card@ ¢ / kwh , or @card@ ¢ / kwh at a @card@ % level of probability . step @card@ - identify technology improvement opportunity ( tios ) as an initial test of the wind path analysis tool , national wind technology center ( nwtc ) research staff identify a set of technological improvement that be expect to contribute to the technology ' s become more cost effective by @ord@ these have be term the technology improvement opportunity ( tio ) . wind turbine design be a matter of constant tradeoff between the compete demand of low cost , great energy productivity , increase lifetime and durability , and maintenance cost . achieve great energy production may cost more , or it may cost less . reduce material to reduce capital investment may adversely affect o & m cost . these be the designer ' tradeoff , and they be capture in the model . however , the model do not currently perform detailed system tradeoff itself . it can include any number of independent technology design path , but tradeoff between component within a system must currently be treat in the estimation of the input parameter . a preliminary set of tios be list in figure @ord@ table @ord@ reference ( @card@ ) wind turbine and plant characteristic figure @ord@ example Coe input distribution figure @ord@ preliminary technology improvement opportunity tio @ord@ advanced ( enlarged ) rotor - some of the most dramatic reduction in cost of energy be expect to derive from sophisticated new rotor design . in the near term , turbine will employ advanced control system specifically develop to reduce structural load . by this mean , large rotor can be mate to exist tower and chassis design . ( in fact manufacturer have already begin to achieve this from their @card@ design . ) the consequence of this approach be an appreciable increase in annual energy production ( aep ) on the order of @card@ % , but with only a minimal increase in turbine capital cost ( tcc ) , on the order of @card@ % . virtually none of these advanced concept can evolve without concurrent advance in control strategy and implementation . for example , extendable rotor , where diameter vary with inflow condition , use blade length as a control variable in addition to torque and rotor speed . adaptive or predictive control system , perhaps use embed sensor or micro-mechanical device , may need to monitor several control input while simultaneously monitor system health . from a good understanding of aeroelasticity , designer have devise way to fabricate adaptive composite blade to reduce structural load . new material , such as carbon fiber or hybrid carbon / glass composite be likely to be apply . an integrated design process require the simultaneous optimization of performance , noise , control , aeroelastics , and structural dynamics will allow these advanced rotor to materialize . a direct benefit be reduce structural weight , but the most promising implementation be increase energy capture through increase sweep area . several recent report sponsor by the doe wind enegy program contain information on potential improvement in rotor . [ @card@ ] [ @card@ ] tio @ord@ manufacturing - r & d in the area of manufacturing method will enable designer to improve the performance-per-unit-cost of wind turbine . as new material be part of Tio @card@ , move towards blade that be both stiff and strong to span great area , and also light and adaptive to reduce system load , will also require improve manufacturing process . since blade control all of the energy capture and almost all of the load , they be the primary target of material , manufacturing , and fatigue research . tool that predict how material work within design detail will assist in improve the tailor of design practice to take into account material interaction , property variability , and specified design load . detailed design of specific component will be well integrate into system code for full structural dynamics and performance evaluation . in addition to the technology manufacturing and design improvement discuss above , there have be recent indication from several source that manufacturer ' S markup may be expect to decrease in the future . several factor may contribute to narrow margin , include low uncertainty and risk with mature product . in addition , price pressure from competition and high sale volume from large , more expensive machine be expect to result in small margin . there have be many report publish by the program that support the potential for advance in this tio . some of these be list in the reference section . [ @card@ ] [ @card@ ] [ @card@ ] [ @card@ ] tio @ord@ reduce energy loss and increase availability - in calculate Coe , the energy convert by the rotor be multiply by a factor to account for various energy loss . these loss be the result of blade soil from dirt and insect , interference among turbine in array , imperfect control for track the wind or maintain rotor speed , and downtime from unexpected or unavoidable event . with improvement in design capability and operate experience , these loss be expect to decrease . in addition , advance in health monitoring technique utilize telemetry or other communication system will allow problem to be diagnose before costly repair be necessary . improvement in extended scheduled maintenance will reduce cost for o & m trip , especially for offshore turbine . tio @ord@ advanced tower - in most location , the wind speed increase with height above the ground accord to a power law function . unfortunately , tower cost also rise with height , and do so exponentially . furthermore , the cost of crane to install and service turbine on tall tower can become prohibitive . now that the design and installation of robust wind turbine tower be refine engineering discipline , the awareness that significantly great energy capture be the reward of tall tower have focus designer on innovative concept to address these issue . technology that have be use for year on smokestack and water tower , for example , be be evaluate for use on wind turbine . hybrid tower of tubular steel atop concrete base be an option , as be self-erecting design of several type . these concept may be view as ` ` enable ' ' technology for tower of @card@ m and tall . reduce the cost of construction , installation , or the tower themselves permit the exploitation of more energetic wind with no increase in land or transmission cost . while tall tower entail increase in turbine capital cost ( tcc ) , the effect of this increase cost be more than offset by the expect increase in energy capture , even at moderate wind site . furthermore , self-erecting tower will provide an appreciable , though currently inestimable , reduction in maintenance cost . recent windpact study provide further information on possible advance in this area . [ @card@ ] [ @card@ ] tio @ord@ site-specific design / reduce design margin - most wind turbine be design to international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) specification for structural adequacy and system safety . the requirement depend upon site characteristic such as annual average wind speed and inflow turbulence . recent study indicate that turbine design for standard iec class definition may be very far off optimum in some application . this be particularly true for low wind speed site , where vary level of Coe reduction be possible depend upon whether specific component be purpose-designed or there be a complete , special-purpose , system design . while it be not yet clear which project warrant site-specific design , the approach be expect to be appropriate for some of the very large project currently envision . in the current Coe calculation , we characterize the wind site as have an annual average wind speed of @card@ m / S measure at a height of @card@ m above ground . wind speed be assume to increase use a power law exponent apply to the ratio of hub height to the reference height . an exponent of @card@ / @card@ be often use for Coe calculation . however , it be well know that there be many site in the u.s. with more favorable wind shear characteristic . there be also site with more favorable distribution of wind speed about the mean - they be skew toward high wind speed . consequently , in addition to the benefit of specially design wind turbine , deployment at these energetic wind site will also expect to occur . to accommodate the somewhat great fatigue load associate with operation at high mean wind speed , a modest increase in turbine capital cost may be expect . tio @ord@ new drive train concept - several wind turbine design team be evaluate promising new drive train concept . many different approach be propose , include highly integrated system , permanent magnet generator and multi-generator configuration . in some case , the drive train also have a favorable impact on chassis and nacelle integration . the important common attribute of these disparate system be the ability to reduce both initial drive train cost and long-term replacement cost by @card@ % to @card@ % . the anticipated Coe increment include the effect of component efficiency and of advanced power electronics appropriate for the particular drive train concept . the doe program have recently publish a report discuss potential advance in drive train . [ @card@ ] [ @card@ ] tio @ord@ advanced power electronics - the january @card@ baseline be a variable speed turbine use a wound rotor generator with power conditioning of approximately @card@ % of its output . future turbine be also expect to be variable speed design . it be likely that some of them will employ direct-drive , permanent magnet generator , which enable elimination of conventional gearbox by control shaft speed and torque electrically instead of mechanically . due to those control requirement , such turbine require power conditioning of @card@ % of their output . in addition to the cost and efficiency improvement of the power electronics , additional cost reduction be expect in subsequent year . these will result from learn experience , as well as improve component and circuit design . tio @ord@ learn curve effect - an accepted phenomenon be that the cost of manufacturing product decrease with increase cumulative production volume . this learn effect result from good tooling and assembly procedure , value engineering , competition among supplier , and general learn experience . it do not include technology advance from r & d or volume discount from large annual or bulk purchase . the rate of reduction be usually characterize by a ` ` learn rate , ' ' or percentage reduction in cost , for every doubling of cumulative capacity . a conservative approach to estimate cost reduction from learning be to assume a range of market growth rate ( say , one or two doublings of cumulative capacity by @card@ ) and a range of small decrease in the learn rate , base on the maturity of the wind technology product and industry , and historical experience with analogous product and industry . step @ord@ estimate tio effect the leave side of figure @card@ show a range of preliminary estimate for improvement in Coe input from the various tios . in the same way that reference coe input be develop use triangular distribution , nwct staff develop triangular distribution for Coe improvement for each tio base on lwst proposal , windpact study , research report , and expert knowledge . ( note that turbine capital cost ( tcc ) and balance of station cost ( bos ) have be combine in the ` ` capital cost ' ' category in the figure . ) the bar on the figure show the minimum and maximum of the triangular distribution . if desire , the model can use other distribution to match special insight one might have on any of the input variable . the Coe improvement estimate for each tio be currently undergo extensive revision and new result be expect later this year . as such , figure @card@ should be consider only illustrative of the technology pathway input and analysis result . it be only partially complete in term of the numerical estimate , as well as the indication of which Coe input be impact by each tio . the leave side of the figure also contain a column for ` ` probability of success ' ' that characterize the chance that improvement of any size will be achieve in each tio . that be , the model first account for the probability that ` ` success ' ' be achieve , and if be , then the result improvement will fall within the range identify by datum bar in the figure . the bar therefore reflect the inherent uncertainty in know the value of future improvement . figure @ord@ preliminary path analysis improvments and result step @ord@ perform analysis to illustrate how the model work in its simple form , assume that there be only two tios . the first reduce capital cost by @card@ % and also increase energy production by @card@ % . the second , which be totally independent of the first , reduce cost by another @card@ % , but produce @card@ % less energy ( a cost-effective trade-off ) . simply add the two together give the outcome that cost be reduce by @card@ % and energy production be increase by @card@ % . because cost of energy be proportional to capital cost and inversely proportional to energy production , the Coe reduction from these two tios would be ( @card@ ) / ( 1+0.01 ) , or @card@ % . in fact , the model represent the output range as a probability distribution around a most likely value , in the same way that it represent the input as probability range . the model can account for any potential interaction among the different tios . in contrast to the simple example just discuss , the model add the potential change probabilistically , and produce a range of potential outcome for cost , energy production , and o & m . this probabilistic treatment be illustrate in figure @ord@ the model further account for the variety of technology configuration that might be use to achieve progress ( e.g. . , through different gearbox design ) . the model ' s ability to analyze the variety of approach to meeting goal be what make it a true " pathway " model . to illustrate , all turbine require a tower and rotor ; but different tower design could be marry to different rotor design , and still achieve the same level of cost-effectiveness . these combination can be think of as compete pathway . it be critical that the doe program be able to represent the fact that there be many potential approach to meeting goal , that some be risky than other , and that some might potentially yield a high level of improvement in exchange for that additional technological risk . step @ord@ review result the right side of figure @card@ show the result range for Coe input improvement ( top of graphic ) , and subsequent reduction of Coe itself ( bottom of graphic ) . the figure show that , while there be a very small chance that Coe could be improve by as little as @card@ % , or as much as @card@ % , there be a @card@ % chance that it will be improve by @card@ % from the reference to a value of @card@ ¢ / kwh , i.e. . , ( @card@ ) / @card@ = @card@ % . conclusion as part of the doe wind energy program ' s overall program planning and management requirement , a methodology have be develop to assess the potential improvement to low wind speed turbine technology . the methodology account for both the probability of success of r & d effort to achieve technology improvement , and the inherent uncertainty associate with the value of those improvement . reference turbine cost and performance characteristic , represent year @card@ leading-edge technology , be develop that result in a mean constant dollar levelized cost of energy of @card@ ¢ / kwh , or @card@ ¢ / kwh with a probability of @card@ % . nwtc and sandia staff have develop a preliminary set of technology improvement opportunity ( tios ) that describe the area for potential improvement to low wind speed turbine technology between @card@ and @ord@ program researcher have also partially develop a preliminary list of improvement to Coe input for each tio . use that set of improvement value in a test run , the wind technology path model result in a projection of a levelized cost of energy ( Coe ) in year @card@ of @card@ ¢ / kwh at a @card@ % level of probability . the wind program plan to conduct an update of the Coe input improvement value for each tio as part of its annual program planning and assessment cycle during @ord@ update result , detail both the source for Coe improvement and their corresponding value , will be report from that activity . acknowledgement nwtc and sandia researcher contribute to this work include Paul Migliore , alan laxson , bob thresher , mike robinson , paul veer , scott schreck and patrick quinlan . tom schweizer at peri also provide technical assistance and review . reference @ord@ malcolm , d.j. . and a.c.

university of technology , lecture in the area of psychological assessment , biopsychology , and statistical analysis at both the undergraduate and postgraduate level . since @card@ i have undertake substantial supervision of postgraduate student engage in a range of psychological and health research , include psychoacoustical topic . at the university of Auckland i be an honorary research fellow in the department of psychology , an associated staff member in the department of chemistry , and have a strong work relationship with member of the university of Auckland ' s school of audiology and school of population health . in @card@ i co-found the world health organisation ' quality of life ( whoqol ) field centre in new zealand . @card@ i have publish paper on the psychophysical measurement of human hearing ability and have present at numerous international conference on the topic . in the past year i have accept invitation from top-tiered psychoacoustic and health journal to peer review scientific manuscript . @card@ preamble @card@ i have be invite by the ohariu preservation society to provide an evaluation of the impact of turbine noise on health and well-being . i have accept this invitation and present finding from research project i have personally initiate and undertake in the last five year . i previously present on their behalf at the original consent hearing in @ord@ at this hearing i note that the commissioner have not have time to read my statement prior to my arrival . i also indicate during this hearing that meridian energy should undertake a psychoacoustical survey of the ohariu valley in order to ascertain the prevalence of noise sensitive individual and other vulnerable group . @card@ on more than one occasion i have visit the ohariu valley and familiarise myself with its layout and character . i have personally visit the makara valley on three occasion in the last year , and on one occasion have the opportunity to listen to the turbine noise . additionally , on numerous occasion i have hear the noise come from turbine situate in the tararua range in the manawatu . current knowledge @card@ wind turbine be a new source of community noise , and as such their effect on public health be only begin to emerge in the literature . the recognition of a new disease , disorder , or threat to health usually follow a set pathway . first , doctor and practitioner attempt to fit symptom into pre-defined diagnostic category or to classify the complaint as psychosomatic . second , as evidence accumulate , case study begin to appear in the literature , and exploratory research be undertake to obtain good description of the symptom / complaint . third , intensive research be undertake examine the distribution and prevalence of those report symptom , the factor correlate with the distribution and prevalence of those symptom , and ultimately to cause-and-effect explanation of why those reporting symptom may be do so . @card@ in my reading of the literature the health effect of wind turbine be only begin to be elucidate , and be catch somewhere between the first and second stage describe in @card@ . the important point to note be that case study ( e.g. . , harry , @card@ ; Pierpont , @card@ ) and correlational study ( e.g. . , Pedersen et al . , @card@ ; van den berg , @card@ ) have already emerge in relation to the health effect of wind turbine noise , and so the possibility of detrimental health effect due to wind turbine noise must be take with utmost seriousness . in this statement i present the result of a pilot study conduct in and around the makara valley that likewise urge a cautious approach to turbine placement . @card@ finally , as with other noise source there be individual variation in regard to the effect of wind turbine noise . however , it be a fallacy to argue that because only some suffer symptom while other do not then those who claim to be suffer the symptom must be make them up . in the field of epidemiology the differential susceptibility of individual be know as risk factor , and assume that individual of a population can be represent by the average characteristic of the population be know as the ecological inference fallacy . in term of wind turbine noise these risk factor be still under study , and one important risk factor be noise sensitivity . in assess the health impact of turbine noise in the ohariu valley it be crucial that noise sensitive individual be assess in isolation and not " average out ' . scope of evidence @card@ in this statement i focus on the health impact of wind turbine noise , and i do not focus on issue outside of noise . thus reference to cell phone or cell phone tower emission or electromagnetic radiation from electricity transmission line have no relevance to the current context , and should be discard out of hand . these argument constitute a form analogy ( e.g. . , weak or false analogy ) , which be not accept as valid scientific critique . for example , a person confine to a room have no way of know whether they be be expose to cell phone radiation but can easily detect the presence of an everyday sound . additionally , these example of " health scare ' be not explain by plausible mechanism , whereas there be a clear and proven link between noise , sleep , annoyance , and health impact . @card@ have consider the context i structure this statement as per figure @card@ . @card@ the terminus of the statement coincide with a summary section and a recommendation that consent should not be grant for this proposal . figure @card@ : a schematic representation of the relationship between noise and health , as contextualise to turbine place in life style area . the number correspond to section in this statement . arrow represent hypothesise or actual cause-and-effect relationship . the statement end with conclude remark . expert witness code of conduct i have receive and read section @card@ to @card@ of the environment court consolidate practise note @card@ head expert witness - code of conduct . i understand all of the clause contain within the code proper , and unconditionally agree to comply with it . @card@ turbine noise and noise level @card@ level be that measure of sound which we associate with the perception of loudness . figure @card@ demonstrate that , for equivalent noise level , people judge wind turbine noise to be of great annoyance than aircraft , road traffic , or railway noise . the most recent research to hand ( van den berg , @card@ ) have confirm the relationship report in figure @card@ , and i have add van den berg ' S datum to the figure . figure @card@ : annoyance plot as a function of noise level for four theoretical model ( rail , road , air : miedema and oudshoorm , @card@ ; wind turbine : Pedersen et al . , @card@ ) and four set of datum obtain from van der berg et al . , ( @card@ ) . for the datum , close symbol be for the entire sample , while open symbol be for those who identify that they have no economic interest . circle represent the percentage of " very annoyed " response whilst square represent the sum of " very annoyed " and " rather annoyed " response . @card@ the lack of equivalence evident in figure @card@ be due to the unique characteristic of turbine noise , that be , cluster of turbine present a cumulative effect characterize by a dynamic or modulate sound as turbine synchronise . table @card@ , which display data i collect early this year to inform a subsequent noise study , display annoyance rating for the top ten rate annoy sound out of @card@ sound play to a group of undergraduate student . sound with an ( m ) indicate audio sample that could be describe as periodic , and in that sense modulate . note that seven of the ten most annoy sample fall into this category , and that these result concur with those in the literature indicate that modulate sound tend to be of high annoyance . table @card@ : mean annoyance rating and standard deviation ( sd ) for ten audio file rating on a scale from @card@ ( not annoy ) to @card@ ( extremely annoy ) . annoyance rating sound mean sd girl yell @card@ @card@ fire alarm ( m ) @card@ @card@ alarm ( m ) @card@ @card@ dentist drill ( m ) @card@ @card@ fire truck siren ( m ) @card@ @card@ abuse @card@ @card@ fire warning ( m ) @card@ @card@ dial tone @card@ @card@ jackhammer ( m ) @card@ @card@ horn ( m ) @card@ @card@ @card@ level be actually a very poor predictor of the human response to noise , and its role in health be commonly over-emphasised . for example , noise standard emphasise noise level as the primary factor in noise-induced health deficit , however , over @card@ year of laboratory and epidemiological research have discredit this stimulus-orientated approach . for this reason noise standard promote only noise level as the metric to assess health impact should be approach with caution . that noise standard be not necessarily definitive be further demonstrate by the lack of agreement that can exist amongst expert on standard . the quarrel surround the revision of the new zealand standard for acceptable wind turbine noise ( nzs6808 ) be testament to this ( see , for example , the september @card@ edition of the nz acoustical society journal , new zealand acoustics ) . @card@ noise standard , even those advocate by the who in the past , be base on the dose-response curve . the dose-response curve plot noise annoyance as a function of noise level . user of a dose- response curve define a level of annoyance that they be willing to accept and then , either graphically or numerically , determine the level of noise that yield the predefined annoyance level . figure @card@ illustrate an actual equation-based dose-response curve . figure @card@ : a theoretical curve formulate to model the relationship between noise level and annoyance to aviation noise . figure @card@ : percentage highly annoy at aircraft noise plot as a function of noise level . the solid curve be a portion of that present in figure @card@ , while the scattered point represent real measurement ( datum from fidell , @card@ ) . @card@ figure @card@ be the same curve but with a shorten x -axis ( now from @card@ to @card@ db ) accompany by actual measurement of noise annoyance from numerous study report annoyance to aircraft noise . note the incompatibility of the theoretical curve ( solid curve ) and the empirically derive datum ( datum take from fidell , @card@ ) . scrutiny of figure @card@ reveal that annoyance reaction to noise vary substantially and do not appear to be correlate with noise level . other factor associate with the listener have be find to correlate with annoyance , and need to be account for when attempt to predict noise annoyance . it can be conclude that the high variability between individual and group make it difficult to model the relationship between noise and annoyance . regrettably , plot such as the figure @card@ above be still use to determine noise standard . @card@ not withstand the criticism of dose-response relationship the who ( europe ) have attempt to categorise different band of noise level in relation to health impact , specifically sleep disturbance . they set out to establish a no observed effect level ( Noel ) and a low observed adverse effect level ( loael ) for noise and various measure of health . the who ' S ( @card@ : table @card@ ) description of the relationship between noise level ( lnight , outside ) and health be repeat in table @card@ : table @card@ . 2 : who europe ( @card@ ) night time guideline . @card@ db although individual sensitivity and circumstance may differ , it appear that up to this level no substantial biological effect be observe . @card@ - @card@ db a number of effect on sleep be observe from this range : body movement , awaken , self-reported sleep disturbance , arousal . the intensity of the effect depend on the nature of the source and the number of event . vulnerable group ( for example child , the chronically ill and the elderly ) be more susceptible . however , even in the bad case the effect seem modest . lnight , outside of @card@ db be equivalent to the low observed adverse effect level ( loael ) for night noise . @card@ - @card@ db adverse health effect be observe among the exposed population . many people have to adapt their life to cope with the noise at night . vulnerable group be more severely affect . > @card@ db the situation be consider increasingly dangerous for public health . adverse health effect occur frequently , a sizeable proportion of the population be highly annoy and sleep-disturbed . there be evidence that the risk of cardiovascular disease increase . @card@ there be a number of important point to be read from these figure , which be expand on in the guideline . first , the who recognize the existence of vulnerable group and acknowledge the existence of individual difference in noise sensitivity . second , health begin to be degrade between @card@ and @card@ db . third , @card@ db be the level that can be consider " safe " . lastly , @card@ db and above can be consider " unsafe " . @card@ as good practice and goodwill to the community i argue that the appellant should be use @card@ db as their criterion . it be interesting to note that the originally who noise work party ( @card@ ) originally stipulate @card@ db , but in the @card@ publication @card@ db be stipulate . as originally draft the who noise work party ( @card@ ) recommendation read thus : " the review of available evidence lead to the follow conclusion ... for the primary prevention of subclinical adverse health effect in the population relate to night noise , it be recommend that the population should not be expose to night noise level great than @card@ db of l night , outside during the night when most people be in bed . therefore , l night , outside @card@ db be the ultimate target of night noise guideline ( nngl ) to protect the public , include the most vulnerable group such as child , the chronically ill and the elderly , from the adverse health effect of night noise . " @card@ the approach of the who ( @card@ ) be useful in some respect , but limit in other . the Noel / loael value be develop primarily with aviation and road annoyance datum . reference to figure @card@ above indicate that a universal criterion be likely to fail unless additional factor be take into account , such as the temporal characteristic of the noise . additionally , both Noel / loael value will not be constant across a define population , as subgroup of that population will be more vulnerable to the effect of noise than other . while the who do acknowledge the existence of vulnerable group , the @card@ level nevertheless rest on aggregate datum that for the most part do not distinguish vulnerable from non-vulnerable group . as describe in @card@ above , such an approach constitute an ecological inference fallacy . @card@ finally , as table @card@ attest , an lnight , outside of @card@ db be recommend as represent the loael . it should be note however that these guideline be produce exclusively for the European context and not the new zealand context . for example , the who use a value of @card@ db for sound attenuation from outside a building to inside , which be great than the @card@ db usually cite ( e.g. . , etsu r @card@ : who @card@ ) . give that new zealand dwelling be commonly make from light construction material such as timber and weather board rather than heavy material such as concrete and stone , the @card@ db attenuation value be not particularly useful . @card@ amenity @card@ typically , noise can be quantify by sound exposure level or audibility , and qualify in term of unwantedness , annoyance , or loss of amenity . there be an expectation of " peace and quiet " when live in a rural area , and most choose to live in rural area as they be bastion of tranquillity ( Schomer , @card@ ) . a rural area be define as an area with a population density less than @card@ people per square kilometre . the literature show that those who live in rural area have different expectation regard community noise compare to those living in suburban , urban , or industrial area . people expect rural area to be quiet , and consequently exposure to noise will produce a great negative reaction in rural area than other area ( Pedersen & Persson , @card@ ) . it be evident in the literature that community setting be emerge as a powerful predictor of annoyance reaction . @card@ if a propose wind turbine installation encroach rural and semi-rural area populate by resident with a great expectation for , and value on , peace and quiet , the reaction to the propose wind turbine be likely to be negative . amenity value be base upon what people feel about an area , its pleasantness , or some other value that make it desirable place to live . noise affect individual and community by modify the extrinsic and intrinsic nature of the environment that attract and hold people to the locality . @card@ survey-based investigation of wind turbine noise have demonstrate a distinction in self-reported annoyance level between respondent live in city and those living in rural area . because attitude towards the noise source influence annoyance , then these rural resident be likely to be more annoyed than those living in suburban or urban neighbourhood . Pedersen and Persson ( @card@ ) sum it up : " ... exposure from wind turbine would be more negatively appraise in an area that be perceive as unspoiled than in an area where several human activity take place ... people choose environment that harmonise with their self-concept and need , and that they remain in place that provide a sense of continuity . when a new environmental stressor occur , the individual ' s relationship with her or his place of residence be disrupt . such a distortion could possibly predispose for an increase risk of annoyance ... expect the home and its surroundings to be a suitable place for rest and recreation could conversely lead to an appraisal of the sound as threaten personal value . the sound be describe as an intrusion into privacy that change the image of a good home . " the same report indicate that annoyance be most frequently report when participant be relax outdoors or on " barbecue night " . it can be embarrass living near source of community noise , and there be a public stigma that only those in the low socio-economic bracket live in the vicinity of noise generator . such feeling discourage resident from invite guest around to their house , and thus community noise interfere with rest and recreational activity . @card@ for a variety of reason wind turbine be place mainly in rural area with low background sound level . the operation of wind turbine cluster within the confine of the ohariu valley will undoubtedly produce noise that be incongruent with the natural soundscape of the area . the immediate and long-term effect of such noise will be to degrade amenity and impact upon the response of a " reasonable person " , to the point where they may become " forced emigrant " . the affinity that rural dweller have to the land be often difficult for their urban and suburban counterpart to comprehend , as too be their response to unwelcome modification of their environment . @card@ the revise version of nzs6808 include an allowance for high amenity area . you can not , however , put a price on amenity and neither can you put a decibel value on it . for the same reason outline in relation to annoyance ( see @card@ - @card@ above ) i would not recommend the approach outline in nzs6808 as a guardian of amenity . @card@ a survey recently undertake my colleague and i ( see @card@ below ) include an open-ended question ask if there be any change to the good or the bad in their living environment / neighbourhood during the last year . comment from rural area ( include the ohariu valley , makara and a turbine-free rural control area ) be present in appendix a . my interpretation of these comment be thus . first , peace , quiet , and privacy , and threat thereof , be reoccurring theme . second , the comment from the ohariu valley indicate that the resident perceive the placement of turbine in the area as a threat to their quiet surround and amenity . the emotional intensity of these comment provide a picture of a community strongly connect with the valley , and for those oppose the turbine i predict especially strong annoyance reaction to turbine noise . third , resident in the ohariu vallet report hear the turbine from makara , indicate the cumulative effect need to be consider . fourth , i note that even in the control area there be a fear amongst resident that they may be next in line for turbine installation . @card@ in the same survey we present two question relate to amenity , both rate on a five-point category scale : 1 ) i be satisfy with my neighbourhood / living environment , and 2 ) my neighbourhood / living environment make it difficult for me to relax at home . when compare statistically to the control area , the makara sample be less satisfy with their live environment and find their living environment make it more difficult for them to relax at home than those in the control sample . the open-ended response display in appendix a suggest that these difference may be explain by the presence or absence of wind turbine . amenity and visual impact @card@ the visual impact of the turbine can also influence reaction to turbine noise , probably because the visual presence of the turbine can act as reminder of the negative impact that they have have on people ' S life . in a Danish study , the position of the listener ( on a flat landscape ) relative to the wind turbine influence their perception of the noise more than the overall level of the turbine ' S noise ( Pedersen & Nielsen , @card@ ) . other study ( delvin , @card@ ) have likewise report that , as a whole , wind turbine be view as eyesore and visual spoiler of the environment ( see cartoon , figure @card@ ) . Pedersen and Persson ( @card@ ) hypothesize that , from an aesthetic perspective , those who view the wind turbine as ugly be likely to disassociate them from the landscape , and as a consequence , react more strongly to turbine noise . their finding have direct relevance to those who value the amenity and restorative feature of the ohuria valley : " wind turbine be describe as environmentally friendly , necessary , but also as ugly ... see a wind turbine in an otherwise non-industrial environment may reduce the individual ' s perception of the naturalness of the area and reduce the perception of restoration possibility . " figure @card@ : a cartoon poke fun at wind turbine installation developer ( here meridian energy ) and nimbys ( not in my back yard ) alike ( from replaced-dns ) . @card@ noise sensitivity @card@ noise sensitivity , consider a stable personality trait that be relatively invariant across noise level , be a strong predictor of noise annoyance and be correlate with sleep quality . noise sensitive individual can be describe by two key characteristic . first , they be more likely to pay attention to sound and evaluate it negatively ( e.g. . , threaten or annoy ) . second , they have strong emotional reaction to noise , and consequently , great difficulty habituating . @card@ note that noise sensitivity be not a symptom of mental illness , but a measurable state that differ in intensity across the population . research have suggest that noise sensitivity be associate with mental illness . however , this do not mean that mental illness be a necessary prerequisite for report high sensitivity to noise , nor that noise sensitivity be a symptom of mental illness . as a trait , noise sensitivity be measure on a continuum from highly noise sensitive to highly noise resistant , and everybody fall somewhere along this continuum : highly noise sensitive highly noise resistant @card@ i further dichotomise noise sensitivity into two different construct ; state and trait noise sensitivity . state noise sensitivity be an emotional state that be characterize by feeling of annoyance due to circumstantial factor . it be evoke when individual be expose to noise that be perceive as psychologically undesirable or physically threaten . the emotional state be generally transitory but can remain as long as the noise exposure persist . trait noise sensitivity refer to relatively endure individual difference in sensitivity to noise . if an individual have high trait noise sensitivity , they be likely to experience state noise sensitivity reaction more often . thus trait noise sensitivity be a measure of the probability of state noise sensitivity be experience in future situation , judge on the frequency and intensity of the individual ' s experience of state noise sensitivity in the past . @card@ most individual exhibit state noise sensitivity in certain situation . those with trait noise sensitivity , however , may try and avoid noisy area and , if give the choice , may choose to live in quiet area . this year myself and colleague from the university of otago and auckland collect datum in both city and rural area , which include self-report noise sensitivity rating . this data afford a comparison of noise sensitivity prevalence in the countryside or a city , and be present graphically in figure @card@ . of remark be the disparity evident in the " none ' and " high ' sensitivity category . note , however , that the estimate of noise sensitivity in rural area may represent an under estimate due to the lack of noise and therefore lack of knowledge that one may be noise sensitive . figure @card@ : bar graph plot percentage of respondent indicate their category of noise sensitivity . black bar represent respondent from rural area whilst grey bar represent those living in a city . @card@ a Scandinavian study on wind turbine noise and annoyance conduct in a rural area report that fifty percent of respondent describe themselves as sensitive to noise ( Pedersen & Persson , @card@ ) . this value contrast with their estimate from urban area ( approximately @card@ % ) and suggest that noise sensitive individual seek out rural area for their low level of noise . from figure @card@ it be evident that there be a great proportion ( by a factor of @card@ ) of noise sensitive individual in rural area than city . @card@ in the first three month of this year my team , in collaboration with brain injury nz , undertake interview-based research attempt to gain further insight into the experience of live with noise sensitivity . we choose survivor of traumatic brain injury as noise sensitivity be the strong predictor of subsequent postconcussive syndrome , and there be a high prevalence of noise sensitivity in this clinical population . we note two recurrent theme in the transcript . first , the debilitating affect of high noise sensitivity , and second , the inability of current clinical practice to detect or treat the condition . @card@ while we purposively target a group with a high prevalence of extreme noise sensitivity , it should be remark that individual with similar level of sensitivity will exist in the general population , that their sensitivity will not necessarily be trace to injury or disease ( though it might ) , and that these individual will seek quiet area in which to live . i include , in appendix b , a selection of quote from the transcript in order to advance an understanding of what it be like to experience noise sensitivity . here be one : " for me , i dunno , probably the noise be one of the big thing ; and if you could take one symptom away from me , if i have to choose one thing that i didn ' t have to have , it would be the noise sensitivity , definitely . " @card@ primary health effect : annoyance @card@ the word annoyance be often misinterpret by the general public as a feeling bring about by the presence of a minor irritant . the medical usage , in contrast , exist as a precise technical term and define annoyance as a mental state capable of degrading health . Suter ( @card@ ) present a formal definition of annoyance : ` ` annoyance have be the term use to describe the community ' s collective feeling about noise ever since the early noise survey in the 1950s and 1960s , although some have suggest that this term tend to minimize the impact . while ` ` aversion ' ' or ` ` distress ' ' might be more appropriate descriptor , their use would make comparison to previous research difficult . it should be clear , however , that annoyance can connote more than a slight irritation ; it can mean a significant degradation in the quality of life . this represent a degradation of health in accordance with the world health organization ' S ( who ) definition of health , mean total physical and mental well-being , as well as the absence of disease . ' ' @card@ both the physical nature of the sound and the psychological characteristic of the listener combine to produce noise annoyance . it be generally agree that a physical threshold exist that , when exceed , almost totally determine the level of annoyance elicit by noise . below this threshold however , other psychological-based factor come to the fore . while there be a strong correlation between the sound pressure level ( i.e. . , amplitude ) of a sound wave and the perceive loudness of a sound , there be no clear relationship between sound pressure level and the psychological response that individual have to a sound . annoyance can only partly be relate to the physical characteristic of a sound , include amplitude ( i.e. . , loudness ) , frequency ( i.e. . , tonal characteristic ) , and how the sound change across time ( e.g. . , modulation ) . @card@ many nonacoustical factor determine how annoyed one will become towards a source of noise . degree of annoyance to noise can not be measure by acoustical equipment such as sound level meter ; instead it can only be describe by the listener themselves . thus , the response of the individual to the sound be just as important as the acoustic property of the sound wave . the " people " side of noise be commonly absent from acoustics report , where acoustician have a tendency to treat a spectrum analyzer or a free field microphone as equivalent to a human be . the reality be that the bulk of the annoyance response be likely to be explain by a collection of interact trait and contextual factor that include age , attitude to the noise source , personality , mental functioning , time of day and noise sensitivity . for example , van den berg et al , ( @card@ ) note that annoyance be also relate to economic factor ( see figure @card@ above ) , and present datum show that those who benefit economically from wind turbine be on average less annoyed than those who do not . @card@ in the new zealand context little research have investigate noise annoyance . limited datum do however exist . one recent urban study identify @card@ % of the sample as have serious concern about neighbourhood noise , with @card@ % have some concern ( carter et al . @card@ ) . the proportion of those seriously concern with neighbourhood noise exceed all other neighbourhood issue include rubbish in the street ( @card@ % ) , walk around after dark ( @card@ % ) , smell and fume ( @card@ % ) , and traffic and road safety ( @card@ % ) . @card@ currently there be not a single credible paper in the peer-reviewed literature state that wind turbine noise be harmless to health . contra to the assertion that wind turbine have no health relate effect , there be an emerge body of evidence inform us that under certain circumstance wind turbine noise can have substantial physiological and psychological impact on the community . for brevity these study be summarise and present in appendix c . @card@ noise sensitivity have a large impact on noise annoyance rating , lower annoyance threshold by up to @card@ db ( miedema & vos , @card@ ) . however , while there be a strong correlation between noise sensitivity and annoyance , the correlation between noise sensitivity and noise level be weak , echo the marginal relationship find between noise annoyance and noise level . @card@ attitude towards wind turbine and their operator be relate to perceive annoyance . a new zealand study ( wild , @card@ ) on public attitude to wind turbine installation identify a substantial number of resident with negative attitude induce by continual turbine breakdown and the high level of maintenance require . additionally , many respondent complain of the uneven spread of benefit of wind turbine installation , and a lack of local of benefit . the same study show that , for people live within five kilometre of the turbine , attitude towards the wind turbine installation appear to become more negative follow the operation of the turbine ( see figure @card@ ) . this trend be not observe with those living between @card@ - @card@ kilometre , and one can speculate that noise be a factor in this change . figure @card@ : attitude towards a wind turbine complex , before and after operation , categorise by distance from place of current residence ( after wild ( @card@ ) , page @card@ ) . @card@ primary health effect : sleep disturbance @card@ sleep be a state of arousal characterize by an unresponsiveness to environmental stimulus and an absence of conscious activity . every living organism contain , within its dna , gene for a body clock which regulate an activity-inactivity cycle . sleep disturbance and impairment of the ability to return to sleep be not trivial event . in the short term , the result deprivation of sleep result in daytime fatigue and sleepiness , loss of wellbeing , poor concentration and loss of memory function . accident risk increase . in the long term , sleep deprivation be link to depression , weight gain , diabetes , high blood pressure and heart disease . @card@ noise interfere with sleep in several way . first , it may be sufficiently loud or annoy to prevent the onset of sleep or the return to sleep follow an awakening . second , noise exposure during sleep may arouse or awaken the sleeper . noise insufficient to cause awakening may cause an arousal . an arousal be brief , often only a few second long , with the sleeper move from a deep level of sleep to a light level and back to a deep level . because full wakefulness be not reach , the sleeper have no memory of the event but the sleep have be disrupt just as effectively as if wakefulness have occur . it be possible for several hundred arousal to occur each night without the sufferer be able to recall any of them . the sleep , because it be break , be unrefreshing and there be a proportional relationship between arousal and doziness , fatigue , headache and poor memory and concentration . @card@ a note on the quality of sleep research , be it relate to noise or otherwise , be warrant . the outcome measure use to estimate sleep quality , be they subjective report or physiological measurement , have in recent time be expose as unreliable or meaningless . both krystak and edinger ( @card@ ) and pirrera et al . , ( @card@ ) can be consult for a critique of current methodology . @card@ audible wind turbine noise have the potential to cause arousal , sleep fragmentation and sleep deprivation . it be unfortunate that noise from wind turbine be often at their loud and most disturbing at night due to an increase in atmospheric stability . in other research directly relate to wind turbine one study report that sixteen percent of respondent experience @card@ db ( a ) or more of noise suffer sleep disturbance due to turbine noise , with all but two respondent sleep with an open window in summer ( Pedersen & Persson , @card@ ) . other also report that wind turbine cause sleep deprivation ( harry , @card@ ) . resident in the vicinity of exist wind turbine installation in the manawatu region have report hear the turbine in their bedroom at night , especially in summer even when window be close . Pedersen & Persson ( @card@ ) , study the effect of wind turbine noise on sleep , show that @card@ % of respondent who be annoy at wind turbine noise also report that they suffer disturbed sleep ( compare @card@ % for those not annoy ) . the effect of wind turbine on sleep have yet to be sufficiently quantify , though it appear that chronic sleep disturbance be the most common complaint of those living near wind turbine . @card@ other survey of resident live in the vicinity of wind turbine installation show high level of disturbance to sleep . a @card@ survey of @card@ resident live within @card@ kilometre of a @card@ turbine , 9mw installation in france show that @card@ % find the noise disturb at night ( butre @card@ ) . a similar us survey in @card@ ( kabes @card@ ) of a " wind farm " in kewaunee county , wisconsin report that @card@ % of those living within @card@ metre find the noise to be a problem , @card@ % of those living within @card@ metre and @card@ % of those within @card@ and @card@ metre . @card@ a study undertake in the makara valley , and describe in @card@ below ( and see appendix a ) , indicate that , compare to matched-control area , satisfaction with sleep be significantly less in turbine area than non-turbine area . while the noise contour present by the appellant may claim to represent " worst-case scenario " i note that they do not represent peak noise level , which be more likely to disturb sleep , and study have consistently demonstrate that sleep quality be relate to peak noise level rather than aggregate measure such as Db leq . nor do the " worst-case scenario " consider mechanical malfunction noise , which i have experience myself on two occasion . i defer to the statement present by rick james as to why the estimate supply by the appellant should be treat with scepticism , and restate again that noise level themselves be of limited utility when predict human response to noise . @card@ ohrstrom & rylander ( @card@ ) conclude that noise sensitive individual have low threshold of noise reactivity during sleep than non-sensitive individual . they demonstrate that noise sensitive individual take longer to fall asleep than non-sensitive individual and that sleep quality be more likely to be compromise by noise in sensitive individual . mark and griefahn ( @card@ ) replicate these finding , report an association between noise sensitivity and subjective sleep quality , that be , great sensitivity be link to worsen restoration , deceased calmness , and difficulty to fall asleep . @card@ secondary health effect : quality of life @card@ like tobacco consumption or sun exposure , potential health deficit from noise exposure , be it turbine noise or any other variety , be unlikely to be immediate . this make the measurement of such deficit a challenge . indeed , objective manifestation of health effect associate with noise-induced annoyance or sleep disturbance may only be detect after @card@ to @card@ year since the onset of exposure , whereas subjective appraisal of wellbeing and health will suffer no such time lag . @card@ a variety of outcome measure have be report in the literature to assess the impact of noise , include annoyance , sleep disturbance , cardiovascular disease , and wellbeing . one approach to health assessment involve a subjective appraisal of health-related quality of life ( hrqol ) , a concept that measure general wellbeing and wellbeing in domain such as physical , psychological , social , and environmental wellbeing . the who ( @card@ ) noise guideline ( europe ) likewise support the use of quality of life measure ( page @card@ ) : " the effect of noise be strong for those outcome that , like annoyance , can be classify under " quality of life ' rather than illness . what they lack in severity be make up for in number of people affect , as these response be very widespread " . @card@ the who ( @card@ ; @card@ ; @card@ ) report that noise-induced annoyance and sleep disturbance can , when chronic , compromise positive wellbeing and quality of life . dratva et al . ( @card@ ) use the short form ( sf36 ) health survey , report an inverse relationship between annoyance and hrqol in relation to road traffic noise . they argue that hrqol would be expect to co-vary more with annoyance than with physical noise measurement . along with collaborator i recently demonstrate that sleep disruption and annoyance be mediator between noise sensitivity and hrqol ( shepherd et al . , @card@ ) . i would expect meridian energy to assess the potential impact of turbine on the quality of life of resident in the ohuria valley . if this have not be undertake then arguably they have be negligent in their assessment of turbine impact . @card@ to determine if wind turbine noise degrade quality of life in a manner consistent with road and aviation noise a team of new zealand researcher undertake exploratory research in the makara valley , a confine rural setting in which wind turbine have be operate for the past year , and which be in close proximity to the ohariu valley . we use a case-control design , the most appropriate in the context , and measure hrqol from resident in the makara valley and those living in a match control area . the response rate , @card@ % and @card@ % respectively , can be consider high for this type of research ( compare to van den berg and colleague ( @card@ ) @card@ % response rate ) . each house receive two copy of the questionnaire , which utilise a who tool to measure hrqol , a neighbourhood satisfaction survey design to mask the intent of the study , and question on amenity , noise annoyance , and noise sensitivity . detail of the study be recently present at a new zealand acoustics conference , and appendix d contain this presentation which afford a summary of the design and finding of the study . @card@ statistical analysis ( see appendix d ) reveal some difference and some similarity between the two area in term of hrqol . first , the makara valley sample report significantly lower physical hrqol , and they be also less satisfied with their sleep than those in control area . second , the makara valley sample report low environmental hrqol , a domain that can be treat as equivalent to amenity . third , there be no statistical difference between the two area in relation to social or psychological hrqol , although the latter be close to significance . finally , when rating overall hrqol there be again a statistical significant difference between the two area . @card@ these result be not entirely unanticipated . at the west wind ( i.e. . , Makara ) hearing Dr van den berg and Dr robert thorne receive agreement from the expert ' caucus to present a separate statement to the agree matter : " we believe that the condition here agree upon will protect resident from severe annoyance and sleep disturbance , but not from annoyance and loss of amenity . we believe annoyance and loss of amenity will be protect when the wind turbine noise limit would be @card@ dba l95 in condition of low wind speed at the dwelling and modulation restrict to @card@ db . " however , because a loss of amenity be relate to annoyance , and annoyance may lead to sleep disruption ( see figure @card@ ) , it appear from our datum that while resident be protect from severe sleep disturbance , they still experience a degree of sleep disturbance that be sufficient to degrade their hrqol . @card@ additionally , once turbine be install in an area where there be local opposition a " defeat reaction ' may emerge . rylander ( @card@ ) describe the characteristic of the defeat reaction after exposure to noise as increase vulnerability to illness and a depression of mood precipitate by intense sorrow , deep frustration , and defeat . the defeat reaction may in turn be amplify by the presence of turbine noise . a Swedish study ( Pedersen & Persson , @card@ ) report that , for respondent who be annoy by wind turbine noise , feeling of resignation , violation , strain , and fatigue be statistically great than for respondent not annoy by wind turbine noise . the datum procure from the makara valley marshal evidence for the defeat reaction in that the makara sample rate themselves as significantly more feeling such as blue mood , despair , anxiety , or depression than the control sample . @card@ these result point to a strong degradation of hrqol in the resident of makara . the ohariu valley proposal be in many be similar to the markara proposal , and so it can be suppose that the erect of turbine will likewise degrade the hrqol of ohariu resident . @card@ secondary health effect : stress-related disease @card@ current thinking argue that both noise-induced sleep deficit and annoyance can induce stress-related disease . any object or event that an individual perceive as a threat to their safety or to the resting and restorative characteristic of their living environment can be classify as a stressor . noise be one such psychosocial stressor that can induce maladaptive psychological response and negatively impact health via interaction between the autonomic nervous system , the neuroendocrine system , and the immune system ( see table @card@ ) . table @card@ : three system implicate in the negative relationship between stress and health the autonomic nervous system a control system in which the brain manage numerous biological process base upon the demand of the environment . the autonomic nervous system control , amongst other process , heart rate , digestion , respiration rate , salivation , perspiration , diameter of the pupil , urination , and sexual arousal . the neuroendocrine system the system link process in the central nervous system ( i.e. . , the brain ) to the endocrine system , which release hormone . the most thoroughly study neuroendocrine complex , the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( hpa ) axis , have be implicate as the chief mechanism in the human stress response . the immune system a collection of bodily structure and process concern with the identification , elimination , and disposal of foreign object ( i.e. . , antigen ) . immune system protect the body from infection , and when compromise , leave an individual vulnerable to disease . @card@ it have long be accept that either physical or psychological stressors can produce a physiological stress reaction . stress be characterise by physiological change that prepare the organism to survive a stressor . as figure @card@ show , two main system be activate by stressors , with noise use as an example of a stressor . the hpa axis produce glucocorticoids such as the stress hormone cortisol . cortisol restrain immune system activity which otherwise can become damaging , but in excess , this restraint of defence can increase vulnerability to disease . it be accept that sleep deprivation increase cortisol level . the sam-axis produce , amongst other hormone , adrenalin , an important component of the sympathetic nervous system ' s fight-or-flight response . adrenaline have the potential to regulate most of the body ' s biological system , and increase heart and respiration rate during episode of stress . note that both pathway be ultimately under the control of the central nervous system ( i.e. . , the brain ) , and this central regulation explain the large range of individual difference in the response to noise . figure @card@ : schematic representation of the body ' s response to unwanted sound . both the hpa axis and the sam axis be regulate by a brain structure know as the hypothalamus . @card@ how the brain and our hearing system interact to produce a stress response have be the relatively well study . figure @card@ be a contemporary conceptualisation of this interaction , and such model can help us explain , for example , noise sensitivity . acute reaction to noise that have be explain by brain mechanism include the startle reflex , the orient response , and the fight / flight / freeze response . these reaction be short-lived , last a few second , and be accompany by instantaneous physiological response , such as cortisol release . chronic exposure result in annoyance and sleep disturbance , both of which be health effect in the own right , and both of which can be induce by a stressor and lead to physiological stress reaction . @card@ in @card@ i collaborate with member of the university of Auckland ' s department of psychology and investigate the physiological underpinnings of noise sensitivity . by nonlinear analyse of heart activity ( i.e. . , the electrocardiogram ) we be able to discern a significant relationship between noise sensitivity and sympathetic activity ( for significance see table @card@ ) , and between noise sensitivity and galvanic skin response , which be a marker of emotional response . these result replicate the finding of dodd ' S ( @card@ ) pilot study , and confirm that noise sensitivity have physiological correlate . i present in appendix e the result from a single participant to display the various analytical indices . use a pre-validated noise sensitivity scale ( the noiseq ) this participant score relatively high on the noise sensitivity continuum . figure @card@ : the link between noise and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( hpa ) axis . note : Raf = reticular activate formation . @card@ noise sensitivity may partly be explain by a hypoactive parasympathetic , and a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system . noise sensitive individual may delay the termination of sympathetic response due to an uncouple of the autonomic nervous system and the amygdala-prefrontal circuit ( see figure @card@ ) that interpret stressful stimulus and enact the appropriate stress response . the result be that the specific brain circuit ( i.e. . , sympathoexcitatory circuit ) get catch in a positive feedback loop lead to hyper-vigilance and misattribution that then produce maladaptive cognition ( i.e. . , annoyance ) . as the stress accumulate , there be increase activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic-adreno-medullary system ( see figure @card@ ) . @card@ almost @card@ year of quantitative research have demonstrate that long-term noise-induced annoyance and sleep disturbance be associate with stress-related disease . the literature concentrate mainly on road , rail , aviation , and other neighbourhood noise source . there be no evidence currently publish that lead me to the conclusion that wind turbine noise should not be treat the same , and as figure @card@ testify , there may be good reason to suspect that turbine noise be in fact more dangerous than other form of noise . @card@ conclu ding remark @card@ in europe ( who , @card@ ) noise be a recognise environmental pollutant that degrade sleep , quality of life and general function . utility-scale wind energy generation , involve the saturation of an optimum number of wind turbine in a fix area , be not without health impact . however , the management of these impact have be hinder by a systemic failure in the prediction of noise level and sound characteristic emanate from wind turbine installation . i be not imply that these shortcoming be exercise of deceit by member of the acoustics discipline , but rather there be substantive international evidence show that these error be due to a lack of adequate methodology . deceit have , arguably , be nurture by the lack of acknowledgment regard the limitation of current method . Mr rick james will describe these limitation in the statement that he present to this hearing . @card@ new zealand have a poor record when it come to the responsible positioning of wind turbine installation . many of the turbine installation erect in the manawatu region be initially welcome by resident who support renewable energy . however , this initial enthusiasm be base upon reassurance from the developer that turbine noise would not intrude into home . the result lack of concordance between the predict impact of the noise and the actual impact of the noise have lead to a rise in resistance to wind turbine installation in the manawatu region . a similar situation occur at makara , although in this instance the turbine be not initially welcome by the bulk of the community . further evidence come from a recent compliance report ( Lloyd , @card@ ) undertake on the te rere hau wind turbine installation that indicate that the complaint make by nearby resident regard noise exposure be justify on the basis of recent noise level reading . note that these reading be discordant with those originally predict and do not comply with the original resource consent condition . @card@ i further suggest that it be a mistake to judge potential health effect on noise level alone . give that noise level explain between @card@ - @card@ percent of the variation in the annoyance response across individual , i would recommend that noise level be give a @card@ - @card@ % weighting in the decision as to whether the turbine should go ahead or not . instead most weight should be place on the potential amenity threat and the impact of vulnerable group in the valley , include the elderly and child , and noise sensitive individual . because of the discrepancy between predict and actual noise level it would be prudent to rely on evidence come from real people at established wind turbine installation ( e.g. . , te rere hau , Makara , tararua ) than disputed mathematical model . @card@ chronic ( i.e. . , long term ) exposure to unwanted sound can compromise health , and these adverse reaction to noise do not easily disappear with repeated exposure . it be propose that adverse reaction to noise can reduce over time , a process know as habituation , which can be a physiological or behavioural . the who ( @card@ ) assert that a habituation to noise be a highly individual matter . noise sensitive individual or individual with certain type of mental illness be less likely to habituate to noise than noise resistant individual . this lack of habituation be expect give the evolutionary significant role undertake by the auditory system , and as such we would predict , and indeed find , difference across individual . @card@ there be numerous reason why wind turbine developer should be discourage from place turbine in the green belt area around city . the decision from this hearing be crucial in as much as it will determine the boundary for turbine placement . support the proposal will expose a good number of other lifestyle / semi-rural community to the threat of turbine , while oppose the proposal will signal that developer need to explore less populated area outside of the greenbelts . from the original consent hearing hold in @card@ i understand that new zealand be not lack in wind resource and it there be vast opportunity to develop more isolated area . @card@ ruling against the mill creek proposal will financially disadvantage a minority of the community . support the mill creek proposal will compromise the well-being of a great many more resident . in addition , those who elicit strong emotional reaction to the loss of amenity that will accompany the turbine will also likely exhibit high annoyance response to the turbine noise that will encroach the ohariu valley soundscape . furthermore , those individual who be highly noise sensitive will likewise suffer from the turbine noise . @card@ it be possible that psychological therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy ( cbt ) could be use to reprogramme the thought process of those experience annoyance through the amenity route , though such a solution may be see as morally reprehensible by some . for the individual with noise sensitivity cbt would not be effective as this be a trait rather than a state condition . for both these group i would advise leave the ohariu valley if the turbine be construct as habituation be unlikely and sleep deprivation and / or stress-related disease be likely and , from the onset , quality of life will decrease . @card@ it be not clear to me that meridian have undertake sufficient duty of care in assess the health impact of turbine in the ohariu valley . for example , to the good of my knowledge they have not assess prevalence of vulnerable group ( elderly , child ) or trait ( noise sensitivity ) or consider factor that predict amenity value ( e.g. . , length of residence ) . nor have they reasonably deal with the experience of resident in the adjacent makara valley . there be a sense that they have attempt to suppress meaningful debate in the direct link between noise and health and instead present argument base on fear of technology . while i have some sympathy for this argument in certain context ( e.g. . , the placement of cell phone tower ) the approach be not relevant to the current context . @card@ base on these observation ( i.e. . , @card@ ) , base on datum i have collect and analyse , and base on the current state of knowledge link noise to impaired health in vulnerable person , i opine that consent should not be grant for the propose turbine in the ohariu valley . reference butré j-l .

final page of the survey and be instruct thus : if you would like to share any comment relate to your neighbourhood or this survey then please do so in the box below . for example , have there be any change to the good or the bad in your living environment / neighbourhood during the last year comment be elicit from respondent in three area : the control area which be demographically match to the makara valley , the makara valley itself , and the ohariu valley : table a.1 : wellington rural control area a1.1 i live in a rural setting . approx @card@ minute by car to near shop . i have neighbour but probably not as close as town . ave @card@ metre . a1.2 the idea of potential wind farm be horrify a1.3 we live on a lifestyle block and we love the peace and quiet . we have a variety of animal and pet . a1.4 where i live be fairly rural . would have more issue if i live in the ' burbs . a1.5 q8 : the drug ' p ' be what make me feel most afraid as it be in every neighbourhood . neighbour child be incredibly noisy , scream and yell all the time . a1.6 live in semi rural area 6km from upper hutt . more traffic from subdivision of block of land . more tree plant in what be once pasture so in future lack of view . horse rider / cyclist who think they own the rural road . a1.7 i live in a rural environment . subdivision of nearby farm be lead to a wee bit of over-crowding ( i.e. . ; curtail some shooting and stock movement ) . but have advantage of meet interesting people . a1.8 too much sub-division of rural land a1.9 problem with boy racer , but healthy environment , friendly neighbour who be not too close . road have recently be widen , which have worsen the boy racer situation a1.10 extensive comment regard housing development without provide infrastructure to support it , example of problem cause be provide . a1.11 a council introduce recycling programme be good . housing development without upgrade the road be put too much pressure on the neighbourhood , make it unsafe for pedestrian , cyclist and horse rider . a1.12 council have a long-term plan to develop the area into high density , affordable housing . community be concern about social problem , noise and pollution affect quality of life and desire to remain in the neighbourhood . a1.13 happy with rural lifestyle after move from city to get away from bad neighbour , in-fill housing , over-crowding and lack of privacy a1.14 problem with mentally ill neighbour a1.15 we do n't know our neighbour a1.16 neighbour pet / hand rear animal be allow to roam free into our property and eat our garden . our young son have be confront by the animal and now do n't cope well with those animal elsewhere . a1.17 no bus in rural area , and no street light . the road be dangerous without them a1.18 since council relinquish local landfill to private ownership , roadside & park litter increase dramatically a1.19 inconsiderate group cyclist who wo n't pull over to let car past , and sport-based road closure which do n't take into account that people need to take child to school , or travel to work etc . a1.20 semi-rural environment get more populated cause earth work , less privacy , and increase problem in narrow road . council also reduce recycle effort which cause rubbish build-up a1.21 increase in fast traffic a1.22 environmental pollution of wind turbine . the propose placement would expose us to noise pollution a1.23 large increase in traffic since i move here @card@ year ago a1.24 would like to know outcome of survey , Deanne gabita thegabites @ replaced-dns neighbour have burgle them several time , affect quality of life . a1.25 wind turbine would be the only reason i would ever want to leave here . a1.26 a lot of theft in our area lately . a1.27 as long as there be no wind farm build along side us i think we ' ll spend the rest of our life here ! a1.28 joy-ride traffic be a problem in our rural area , especially for the people walking , ride bicycle , and horse . a1.29 the road be not safe for the amount of traffic . bike , child , horse and pedestrian share the road with car , truck , farm vehicle etc . a1.30 no wind turbine be a great relief for everyone . motorcross driver & log truck be dangerous on the road . lack of broadband be frustrating . a1.31 poor quality dangerous road , & poor public transport . commute be too long a1.32 a walkway have just open up , which have spoil our seclusion a1.33 the community be under threat by potential wind farm a1.34 feel threaten by the wind farm destroy their peace a1.35 local council be invest in the neighbourhood with thing like road , library art-work , rubbish & recycling . i feel as though my rate be benefit me . a1.36 rural setting mean little or no service from council such as lighting / footpath a1.37 neighbour dog constant bark a1.38 council do n't consider local resident , and ca n't seem to agree with regional council a1.39 subdivision mean more people , road not up to it . too narrow and wind . pesky road cyclist who think they own the road . a1.40 subdivision have cause friction between neighbour a1.41 roading ca n't cope with population growth in neighbourhood a1.42 vandalism from kid who do n't live in the area , and people dump rubbish who do n't live in the area table a.2 : makara valley a2.1 i live in makara which be a rural community . the westwind farm have be commission in the last @card@ month . this have have a considerate or great affect on my way of life , and have change the way i live and also deprive me of my great interest and activity . a2.1 installation of wind turbine have have a negative effect on my environment a2.1 there be only @card@ issue in our neighbourhood that cause concern and that be the building of an industrial wind generation site call westwind by meridian , an soe . in many way it have bring this community closer together to fight the common foe . the problem be not the visual . the problem be the noise generate by the wind turbine . we be concern about the adverse health effect and sleep deprivation that be cause by them . well over @card@ complaint have be log on the @card@ complaint line , but little have be do to improve the situation , the wind industry noise standard nzs6808 be not adequate to protect resident when the turbine be build with no consultation with resident . we didn ' t want them there , and the government and their soe ride roughshod over our concern . a2.1 we live in makara , have be here @card@ year , move here for the quiet life plus have more land to enjoy . we enjoy being outside work on our land . i work full time in the cbd so look forward to come home to the quiet , but unfortunately in the last two year we have have turbine install . we see twelve of them from our home . when i sit in my chair in the live room , this be alright but when they get noisy this be what i get upset about . you go to bed to sleep and the noise be there , it sound like a plane that keep go around and around and do not fly away , or it be the vibration we feel . i have not have a decent night ' s sleep in that time . i can wake up to about six time in the night so my quality of life have change for the bad . nobody want to know . basically we be leave to get on with it . if we complain we be a pack of whiner or whingers . our rural lifestyle be horse , no transport , no lighting , but we do have a café . a2.1 we live in a rural village - access to shop , medical , public transport etc in a @card@ / @card@ min drive over a wind road up a steep hill . we have be inflict by a wind farm with visual and noise pollution , complete late last year . a2.1 not in the last year , but previously . turbine have be build behind our property cause grief , lack of sleep and lack of stress in family harmony . a2.1 wind turbine have spoil the district . a2.1 i live on a lifestyle block on the fringe of wellington city . a2.1 i live within @card@ of @card@ turbine . they be to the north + northwest ( prevailing wind ) of me + some to the south . i live on the valley flat . the sound be noticeable during the day but at night it bother me when i be a ) try to go to sleep b ) if i wake up . a2.1 it be not a loud noise but it be a vibration . i admit it probably meet sound condition of the resource consent but this say more about what be allowable under resource consent than about what be reasonable and comfortable . without adequate sleep or with disturbed sleep i begin to feel anxious and stress and it be hard to separate out what be contribute most to the stress i experience . i have just return from @card@ day away in the south island . i have a fantastic trip so probably my rating reflect that . a2.1 power station wind farm have destroy the recreational and tranquillity of the region with unexplained vibration and noise pollution . people work outside be effectively bombard with frequency with cause headache , dizziness , and motion sickness . this be amplify at night when sleep . a2.1 the big change in my living environment have come from the direct impact of the wind farm build in our district despite strong opposition from resident . i now have @card@ visible turbine in my direct line of sight - the close be @card@ kms range to @card@ kms . i be disturb by noise , sight , vibration , flicker shadow and red light on top of turbine . my sleep be disturb . i live in a rural environment for its peace , lack of housing , beauty , relax lifestyle . the wind farm have change all that , we be not compensate nor draw any direct benefit from them ( unless of course i include some notion of a reduction of green-house gas and global warming etc etc ) a2.1 as far as my community be concern , this questionnaire would have great relevance and significance if it be to study the extremely harmful effect of live within a short distance of wind turbine . overseas study be begin to show how people and community in general be suffer . to apply pressure on the government and energy supplier , they need to see a properly conduct survey that hopefully would stop wind turbine be site so close to people ' S home . all university and the nz whoqol group could make a significant contribution . please think seriously about do this . a2.1 meridian energy have complete construction of " west wind " wind farm in our quiet rural area . it at time produce noise into the environment that dominate the background noise level and sound . resident have no compensation for their changed living environment . most consumer of power don ' t think about the consequence of their usage - our quality of life be effect . a2.1 the big change have be the building and operate of the wind farm . i have have to de-tune my ear and sense to the noise create by the turbine . generally i sleep all night and the turbine have wake me on several occasion , and i have not be able to sleep . the generally absolute silence we love live here have go . sydney - balmain be quiet than our property now . a2.1 our living environment have change dramatically in the last year or so . meridian energy have build " west wind ' , a wind power station with turbine along the ridge that face our home . the turbine be too close to home ; there be around @card@ private home within 2km of the turbine . many home lie downwind from the turbine - the prevailing wind flow over the power station site towards home . as we say , this carry the noise for great distance . the company tell the general public that : " the turbine will not be noisy for the resident of makara " - and so get the general public to support their proposal . now it be noisy for us , the company say they always say there would be some noise ! ! the truck start at @card@ : 30am every morning except weekend ( when on Saturday it be 6am ) - during construction . the background sound level at my home have be measure at 14.1dba at night - so the traffic wake me up , and then i could not get back to sleep . meridian assure the court construction traffic would not start until 6am . it take six month to get the @card@ : 30am start stop - by that time i be exhaust ( and my husband too ) with the lack of sleep . my husband ' S work also suffer . the power company have treat our community with utter disdain - as if we do not exist even . they do not carry out the background noise test that they be suppose to have carry out - they get away with whatever they want - leave the community powerless and with a completely change - for the bad - environment . this be unjust , as they have profit from their dishonesty and cavalier disregard while the community have suffer , yet the community be always honest in it ' S claim . meridian have stop access to the makara farm / terawhiti which we have always be able to access in the past to go over the hill to access the coast further south , so considerably restrict recreation opportunity that use to abound in our environment . our landscape have be change from an outstanding natural landscape to a vast and kinetic industrial landscape . what we use to enjoy and appreciate have be lose . we can not avoid see turbine blade from our deck and the garden around our home which face towards the nw to catch our sun . we have spend most weekend away from makara and our home , to escape . a2.1 we have a good neighbourhood ( rural ) . meridian west wind project have cause all sort of issue - initially , we have a mutual enemy that bring us together . however , now , the reverse seem to be happen - with some people take what they can from meridian and other who have serious noise issue find that attitude obnoxious - so the turbine be cause rift that be never there when we move out to makara . endless giant pilot truck movement through our formally quiet rural road to fix break turbine be annoy . the council doesn ' t really care . a2.1 before the turbine be build , there be no loss of sleep , nausea and headache . within three month of their construction the symptom start . it ' s terrible now when the wind come from the north of northwest . the quality of life be go . how the government and the city council have allow this to be build be completely beyond my comprehension . table a.3 : mill creek a3.1 many change for the bad , more house be build , neighbour closer ( sound travel in the countryside ) , townies with no idea of animal control and pest control , and consideration , and fencing issue etc . don ' t respect boundary , animal stray , more traffic - speed , boyracers , motorbike , atvs . people cut down tree and not replant . damage and silt affect stream and run off neighbourhood property . rubbish along the road - dump from van and car . windfarm issue - change whole wellbeing feeling of the neighbourhood and split family etc . some positive , some people plant tree , native bush : more bird . some go organic , reduce spray use and fence off stream from stock . a3.2 the proposal of a windfarm in our neighbourhood have have an extremely negative impact on our local / neighbourhood community . it go to the environment court late in the year . a3.3 problem , erect windmill , luckily we still fight . neighbour , great , quiet , pleasant . bugger all street light - thank god ! a3.4 we live in a rural area , now fight wind farm . too many house and subdivision be allow with little or no consideration to existing landowner house sitings . this be put huge pressure on the quality of life in this rural area and seem the " rule " for subdivision be not be follow at all . a3.5 we live on a lifestyle block in takara gorge road , ohariu valley . we have notice an increase in road traffic over the last year . this be in part due to improve road surface encouraging more user , especially in the weekend . speed and noise be a constant issue and concern , especially with our community foot traffic on the road , ie house / child + also cyclist be unsafe as a result . since west wind turbine installation have become fully operational we can hear the turbine and we be more than @card@ km from them . we don ' t hear them every day but it be concern that we hear them at all . many of our neighbour can hear them and be suffer disturbance to their sleep and quality of life . we be deeply concern about the propose mill creek wind turbine installation which will be much close to our home . a3.6 some level of stress relate to propose windfarm ( mill creek ) . stress relate to neighbour not get on so well ( those for vs those oppose to wind farm ) . worry over potential effect of noise and how this may affect our quality of life . currently we can not really hear the turbine at makara - just occasionally and not too intrusive . a3.7 road into the valley have get busy with more truck and general traffic . our outlook to the south ( makara ) be now dominate by @card@ - @card@ turbine . we be visit by meridian ' s landscape expert earlier this year as our property have be identify as be significantly affect by their propose mill creek wind farm . photo simulation show that most of the windfarm be potentially visible from our property . during their visit they comment that we could be surround by turbine . we find this very distressing as our surroundings be very important to us and we put our heart and soul into create a special environment for our family . it have be a shock for our community that ( @card@ % ) to learn that our home have no protection and we have no representation and support from the council or government . in the past year we have install solar hot water and solar panel which provide all the electricity we need with any excess go into the grid . this have not cause any disturbance to our neighbourhood ! a3.8 the main problem be the divide in the community about the propose turbine , which would very much affect our household with visibility , noise , glare , and vibration . otherwise we enjoy the peace , tranquillity , and privacy and that ' S why we choose to live in this area . a3.9 we have a peaceful rural lifestyle that we relish and i feel this contribute to a high sense of wellbeing , have a sanctuary to return to at the end of the day . a3.10 traffic and the road seem busy . community discussion centre around propose wind farm . this cause mistrust and tense feeling where before there be none . lack of protection and representation be a big issue . destruction of community be a possibility if wind farm go ahead . people value their lifestyle and appreciate amenity value in the valley . we can see @card@ turbine from makara when we be tell that we would see none by the developer - this have cause us to question motive and honesty . a3.11 loss of community spirit due to small section of community seek to establish a wind farm on the nearby hill . a3.12 our neighbourhood be the ideal rural lifestyle that we want and move into the valley for , however , in the last year project westwind have cause some noise nuisance and the possibility of the mill creek wind farm proceeding be extremely concern to us as we would be less than 2k from the near proposed turbine . the experience of the resident at makara be of grave concern regard noise and health affect from the turbine not to mention loss of property value . the court process over the propose mill creek have divide the community , previously it be a very strong and close rural community , now it be divisive . i worry about our future if mill creek get consent , whether we will be able to live in our house , if it will devalue , i be very noise sensitive and worry about how i will deal be that close to turbine . this be a very real concern to myself , my husband , and many resident in the community . i be not adverse to change , technology , wind farm in general or green alternative , but i strongly object to have my quality of life in my own home reduce by noise , vibration , visual disturbance and possible health effect on the basis of " its all for the great good of the nation " . a3.13 we live in a beautiful rural environment however the threat of wind turbine come into our environment have cause stress in the community and great fear of loss at our unique environment . a3.14 we live @card@ km from the new west wind industrial turbine complex . since it start we have be wake and prevent from sleeping . there have be tinnitus , develop headache , lack of concentration and disturbing feeling that course through the body , difficulty breathing and tightness in the chest . we feel disempowered as no government minister or councillor will even meet us let alone discuss and be actively support plan to extend closer still to our home . a3.15 we be very fortunate to live in a rural area , approx @card@ km from johnsonville . we have @card@ child age between @card@ yrs . i believe our environment have affect our child and ourselves in a positive way . everyone be keen to stay home more and enjoy the surroundings . however , there be a lot of discord in our area due to propose wind turbine be install next year . we have not enter into the argument or discussion surround the issue . a3.16 since project west wind be commission we have have numerous occasion when we could hear them . until meridian fix the special audible characteristic problem they could be hear as a distant rumble noise in n ' westly wind condition but on top of that noise be a clear mechanical noise like a distant aeroplane . the noise would come and go . since sac have be " remove ' by meridian , the noise disturbance have reduce but on occasion it can still be hear as a distant rumble . on one night in early June ( frosty ) i could hear blade swish . these turbine be @card@ km to the west of us . we be face with the prospect of another @card@ turbine ( project mill creek ) also a meridian energy project . i be extremely anxious that the noise from these turbine will dominate our live environment here on takarau gorge road . the near @card@ turbine will be between @card@ and @card@ km away from us in the north west if meridian be grant consent for mill creek . i have visit property that be furiously affect by noise from makara on the low takarau gorge road and on the south makara road . these property be between @card@ and @card@ km away . the resident be suffer noise disturbance and their sleep be affect . i know and understand these consequence . there be many family in the ohariu valley that refuse to believe these affect . i be concern that they will suffer as well . a3.17 i live a semi-rural area that have change slowly over the last @card@ yrs . the change be currently escalate due to propose wind turbine to be place quite close to residence and a marked upgrade in socio-economic resident . a3.18 ohariu valley have be an unspoiled part of new zealand ' s history until meridian desecrate the makara area with @card@ wind turbine . unaware of the true disturbance these turbine would create due to the total mis-information supply by meridian and the lie feed to the ohariu valley resident by meridian and the director of windcorp , the resident unfortunately do not support the makara community as we should have to stop the west wind project from go ahead . the true ill-health effect of turbine of this size situate so close to people ' S home have be document world wide and prove to be true yet meridian choose to ignore them and up to now the court have not take seriously the extent of the effect . this have to change and these wind farm stop in close than at least @card@ ks from the near home . people ' S life be be ruin for a short-lived monetary gain by the like of meridian energy . a3.19 we be currently fight a proposal to build a wind farm be erect in our gorgeous valley . this be a major stress both emotionally and financially on ourselves , our family , and our community . it will be resolve in the environmental court this October . i suggest you repeat your survey after the outcome be know , that might teach you all a lot more ! a3.20 we now have an industrial wind farm less than 2kms away from our farm . not only be this a noise issue but also with consent give for another wind farm to be put in on yet another lot of hill to the north of us , they ( wind turbine ) will also be a visual problem as well , catch in between industrial site . no pleading from our community , re noise condition have make any difference at all ! no compensation for loss of property value , simply lack of consideration for a very unique small community that doesn ' t have a chance against a power company . a3.21 i have live in a quiet rural environment for @card@ year by choice . @ord@ because it be quiet . @ord@ because it offer a life style choice ( horse care / farming on @card@ acre ) . @ord@ because it be close to the city where i can get part time work if need . @ord@ neighbour be too far away to be a problem . i live a comfortable , busy , rewarding life . i be now threaten by meridian and @card@ other " neighbour ' by a propose @card@ industrial wind farm less than @card@ km ' S from my paradise . i get sleep disturbance from west wind ( west farm ) at makara - @card@ kms away that have already be commission . i ' m extremely anxious about : a ) my property value . b ) my community polarisation over this issue . c ) the cost to me personally fight to preserve my neighbourhood . a3.22 wind turbine centre . we live @card@ km away from makara westwind wind energy centre and i ' m wake sometimes by a low frequency grind noise , @card@ - @card@ am . there be another meridian project plan @card@ km from our house ( mill creek ) & we know that the noise will be unacceptable . the big drive behind these so call green project come from the e.t.s. & the govt , council be hell bent on push them through . we ' re not hear by the general public as they have be brainwash & the turbine aren ' t in their face . the medium , tv , newspaper win ' t air our complaint as executive on their board be also on meridian ' S - ie Fairfax etc . a3.23 mill creek wind farm proposal by meridian have split the community into @card@ divisive half . those support it ie farmer that have lease land & their friend + people not concern or inform about the potential noise and health impact & those that be concern . the proposition have halt much of the real estate activity which be a classic demonstration that everyone want green power but not in their backyard ie lifestyle block be very much seek after until announcement if the wind farm come thru . seem that it be the local that must pay for the great good of green energy ... a3.24 the last @card@ year have be incredibly difficult with the propose wind farm . the stress of your live environment potentially change & confrontation from people propose change have be very intimidate and as a result at time it have be difficult to sleep . a3.25 in our neighbourhood there be a proposal to build a wind farm within @card@ km of our home . this be of grave concern to my family due to the industrialisation of our countryside , our view from our home and the potential noise disturbance . this have cause stress and concern to us . a3.26 since the build and start up of the turbine in Makara i have find them visually offensive ( i can see approx @card@ from my home ) and when they be first be build i be reduce to tear on more than one occasion . they have turn my rural view to a industrial abomination . the noise produce by these turbine ( approx @card@ - @card@ km distant i estimate ) have cause me physical distress , sleep disturbance and a funny feeling of pressure - my ear in certain wind condition . the combination of these plus have to fundraise / put my life into a holding pattern to fight the progress of destroy ohariu valley with more turbine have cause some stress in my relationship both at home and at work . ohariu valley be one of the most loving , supportive community i have ever living in and turbine have completely split this community into a number of group with all the associate distrust , lie , and backstabbing as those who want the turbine ( they be get money from meridian ) try to undermine and destroy the rival group . a woman ' s support group that be very strong - this valley for more than @card@ year be now fall apart as various woman from both side will no longer mix socially base on their opinion of the turbine . a3.27 this neighbourhood in ohariu valley use to be a wonderful , friendly , peaceful place to live . not now : people be at war : family have fall out with each other , marriage break down , & neighbour not be nice to each other all over money = the cause = wind turbine . five family be get million of dollar & a almost @card@ other family have to live with the noise , vibration , property devaluation + sleep deprivation . we be look for somewhere else to live - but will cost a fortune to move & we would have to degrade . my life right now be not pleasant for my family and our quality of life be not good . this reflect in our daily output which be reduce . this be more than sad - it be destructive to the community = fatal for society . a3.28 since the greedy farmer in the valley put up wind farm they have split the community into two . the loving peaceful valley that i move into will never return . they have destroy the peace and harmony that have exist for over @card@ year . have the wind farm proposal go through concert have put our life on hold and even if we want to sell we will sell for a lot less than what we purchase it for . a3.29 a couple of point that may ( or may not ) be relevant . 1 ) i have be recently widow and this have affect / lower some of my satisfaction result which would previously have be high . 2 ) i live rurally so many of the issue of be non-issues . 3 ) the peace / tranquillity / satisfaction with my neighbourhood be threaten by a potential wind farm within the immediate vicinity . i be sensitive to noise so if this be to go ahead it would change some answer i be sure . appendix b table b : select comment from interview with eight traumatic brain injury survivor experience noise sensitivity . each participant receive the same series of question probe their experience with everyday sound before and after the injury . b.1 um it ' s more frustration really , its , the frustration that i can ' t do anything about it and i have to live with it b.2 i ' m get frustrated with myself cause i can ' t think the way i want to think , it take a lot more effort to concentrate on my conversation or what ' s happen around me b.3 and it ' S like god i just want to sleep and you can ' t , it ' S like you ' re not in control of your own brain b.4 i ' m much less tolerant of child cry around me , um ... .yer so i think noise differently lead to impatience with people b.5 it really annoy me when people who can ' t walk without slop their foot ... .it really get on my nerve and i think , ohhh god , can ' t walk , can ' t walk near , can ' t be near them b.6 i be horrendously embarrass all the time , i didn ' t even want to talk to people b.7 i feel very inadequate , i feel inadequate as a mother , as a partner because i can ' t understand what be go on around me on a day to day basis b.8 initially , initially after the head injury i think all that stuff be go to fade into the background ; i think the noise sensitivity and that sort of stuff would just fade into the distance and life would become normal again , um , to what i have know before b.9 when you have a lot of noise like that it increase your fatigue , if ... . i guess the level of noise you hear have an effect on the stimulation on your brain and that ' S where the fatigue come in , pain come in b.10 it ' s a conglomeration of noise and i find i just get overload to the point where i just want to escape from it b.11 go to a cafe in mission bay and we be there for an hour and i could feel my fatigue level get high and high because um ... .having to concentrate because there be um people just that background noise and also car and truck drive around and as i get more tired you become more sensitive and you notice the sound more b.12 i find it hard to concentrate on more than one thing at a time , i think also that when it happen , when you ' re out , you can hear both thing but can concentrate on either b.13 i can ' t um , i lose my train of thought if noise come in and interrupt me , like the phone go , er like the phone ringing ... .its really loud ... i lose my train of thought quite quickly and can ' t get it back it ' S disrupt my thinking , it disrupt my peace , it disrupt my concentration , its , its err ... .it ' S change the way i live ... . b.14 if i could , flick that magic switch and switch off , block out the noise that people can , can learn to block out and work with , with life would be so much easy ... . i could concentrate good on my study ... . b.15 it have , the implication have be huge because it ' s restricted , it ' S restrict my entertainment side of thing , i don ' t we use to go out a bit , i don ' t now ... .um it ' s restrict that its restricted activity that i would do , before i have a brain injury i use to like do thing like go on the rollercoaster ' S and stuff when we go away , i use to enjoy noisy activity , um and i won ' t , i don ' t even do them now like noise stuff b.16 if i go to the gym and i have to think if i ' m not have a good day then either i won ' t go to the gym because i know it ' s go to be hard because there be lot of sound b.17 i don ' t go to sport anymore , i use to be a netball player and a coach , but it , i can ' t stand the sound of the whistle b.18 take them ( two young boy ) to music class and stuff like that i wish i be able to do but i would have drop and run b.19 i use to go to air show but not anymore , thing like activity , my son go to the v8 ' sthe other weekend and i really want to go but i know i wouldn ' t be able to stand the noise all day b.20 i ' ve have to let go of my dream to do my phd and work internationally as an environmental consultant ... . i ' ve lose my job as a teacher b.21 i stop go to church because it be just too hard , with the singing ... .um it be very hard ... .because it make ... it make the frustration great , and go to church and have the community kind of prayer , um , be an avenue that be close to me b.22 it mean to me ultimately pain , um , because certainly in the early day i be so sensitive to any noise that i have to wear um ear plug if i want to leave the house at all b.23 and it ' S like god , i just want to sleep and you can ' t ; it ' S like you ' re not in control of your own brain b.24 but cause my filter have be kind of out of whack um you hear it all and it ' S really hard for you to shut any of it out , no control b.25 noise probably be a far strong one , far far strong than light , because i feel like i can control light more , and easy than noise , ... . that it ' S far harder to control noise cause there ' S so many outline factor that you can ' t even , remotely touch on b.26 it ' s the conglomeration of noise and i find i just get overload to the point where i just want to escape from it ... . . i would go to the furthest corner of the library away from everyone and i could still hear it b.27 it ' S like um your living in a world through ... .with micro / speakerphones strap to each side of your head , like sometimes it ' S just so much it ' s , you just can ' t get away from it b.28 you can ' t choose the sound you want to hear , it ' s just everything magnify ... .where ever you be b.29 like i walk to the shop um Mt albert and i should have get a cab but i be like , at that stage , i be like nah i wan na walk , i wan na actually be able to do something myself ... . i end up walk with my finger in my ear b.30 i need to think about where you ' re go , so if i ' m go somewhere i might think well take ear plug as it might be too loud and like to be able to drive or have an exit plan b.31 it ' S shout ( shopping ) , and it feel , to me it feel like it ' S really shout so i learn that to go shopping either late in the evening or early in the morning b.32 i like to go to cafe but my friend and i will only go to one that be quiet , or where we can actually get to a quiet place b.33 um apparently i be a neurotic house wife and i have to go home and get over it ... that be the first assessment i get b.34 like i use to ask , cause my door be right by the front door and i ' d ask them could they leave out the back door , cause they wouldn ' t understand why would go out the front door be an issue b.35 there be a boy in front of us who keep talk to somebody and it feel like shouting , shout for no reason and to the point he get me so angry appendix c a summary of research undertake on wind turbine noise * preamble there be now a number of study show that turbine noise be annoy , and that there be a link between annoyance to turbine noise and health as define by the who . a brief description of this evidence be now list , and where possible , technical jargon have be omit or minimise . it should be note that , without exception , all of these study have shortcoming , and indeed , research of this type be vulnerable to inherent limitation that serve to dampen its impact . however , the study select represent credible researcher undertake difficult research . harry ( @card@ ) Dr amanda harry , a British general practitioner , conduct survey of @card@ resident live near several different turbine site and report a similar constellation of symptom from all site . of the @card@ respondent , @card@ % feel their health have be affect , in @card@ % it be sufficiently severe to consult a doctor and @card@ % feel their quality of life have be adversely impact . this study be open to criticism for a design that invite symptom report and be not control . while the proportion of those affect may be question it nevertheless indicate strongly that some member of the public be severely affect by wind turbine noise at distance think by government and industry to be safe . harry , a .

Bolin ( @card@ ) have show that vegetation noise do not mask turbine noise as well as expect . with regard to health it be conclude that : " there be no indication that the sound from wind turbine have an effect on respondent ' health , except for the interruption of sleep . at high level of wind turbine sound ( more than @card@ db ( a ) ) interruption of sleep be more likely than at low level . high level of background sound from road traffic also increase the odd for interrupted sleep . annoyance from wind turbine sound be relate to difficulty with fall asleep and to high stress score . from this study it can not be conclude whether these health effect be cause by annoyance or vice versa or whether both be relate to another factor . " though the conclusion appear to contradict itself , and the assertion that only sleep be a factor can not be conclude from their datum as they do in fact find a relationship between annoyance and stress , but they could not conclude which one cause the other . van den berg , f . , pedersen , e . , Bouma , j . , and bakker , r .

Thorne ( @card@ ) as part of his research into the perception of low amplitude intrusive sound thorne have find that there be significant difference in response between people live in rural area near wind farm and people live in urban community . base on a series of sound simulation he find that the rural people interview find the sound of the turbine " unpleasant , annoy and disturb ' whereas the urban community , who have not see the wind farm or turbine , find the sound " pleasant and gentle ' . a series of noise sensitivity questionnaire also indicate a statistically significant difference between the two community with the rural community more sensitive . further research at two different locale near wind farm show that individual initially accept of wind farm can become increasingly sensitise to very low level ( outdoor laeq @card@ db or less ) of sound from wind farm due to the visual dominance of the turbine themselves and to noise that cause sleep disturbance or perceive adverse health effect . sleep disturbance be cause by the vary nature of the wind farm noise ; the " rumble-thump ' or " swish ' sound hear inside the home at level of laeq @card@ to @card@ db or less and can not be avoid . the work of thorne ( @card@ ) be to establish a practical methodology to integrate human perception of sound , personal sensitivity and relevant sound character analysis .

Pierpont report also that all ( actually @card@ of @card@ ) adult subject report " feel jittery inside " or " internal quiver " , often accompany by anxiety , fearfulness , sleep disturbance and irritability . Pierpont hypothesise that these symptom be relate to low frequency sound and suggest physiological mechanism to explain the link between turbine exposure and the symptom . of particular concern be the observed effect on child , include toddler and school and college age child . change in sleep pattern , behaviour and academic performance be note . seven of the ten child have a decline in their school performance while expose to wind turbine noise which recover after exposure cease . in total , @card@ of @card@ study subject report problem with concentration or memory . Pierpont ' S study mostly address the mechanism for the health problem associate with exposure to wind turbine noise rather than the likelihood of an individual develop symptom . nevertheless , it convincingly show that wind turbine noise be strongly associate with the symptom she describe , include sleep disturbance . she conclude by call for further research , particularly in child , and a two-kilometre setback distance . a recent paper ( todd et al , @card@ ) have show that the vestibular system in the human ear , the part concern with detection of movement and balance , be exquisitely sensitive to vibration at frequency of around @card@ hz .

select a wind farm site be complex , time consuming , and involve multiple discipline work on parallel path . financing , government permit , meteorological study , land use restriction , and design have to be complete or well along before a site be approve and before construction can begin . however , it be imperative in all of the above-referenced step that construction expertise be involve and consult to achieve maximum use of the approve site . there be three principle source of construction expertise generally participate in wind farm project . they be the design team responsible for conceptual and eventual site design , the developer or construction manager of the project , and the wind turbine generator contractor . wind farm developer should include on their initial concept and development team people with expertise in site design and wind farm construction , regardless of whether those people ultimately end up work on the wind farm construction . after conceptual approval and financing , expertise should be add to the team regard the selection and operation of wind turbine generator . this expertise will allow the non-construction professional on the project team to understand the limitation of various wind turbine design , the site specific issue that may affect the layout and operation of the wind farm , and the scheduling , civil engineering , and electrical issue that will affect actual wind farm construction .

wind be big and wind be heavy . these two factor introduce unique consideration to the construction of a wind farm that differ from the construction of other power generation facility . big and heavy will contribute to the determination of an appropriate site , will determine the schedule for construct the wind farm , and will contribute additional cost to transportation , site preparation , construction , and commission . when select the appropriate site for construction a wind farm , schedule consideration should be give to access the site and to construct the site . integral to both of these site selection concern be the preoperational project schedule . development of a wind farm generally take from @card@ to @card@ year with construction take more or less than a year depend upon decision make in the development phase . one of the key decision that can affect the construction schedule would be the lead time in order the wind turbine generator select for the project . to the layperson , all wind turbine may look the same , but that be not reflective of reality . turbine design , turbine dimension , turbine weight , and turbine

manufacturing location all affect the construction of a wind farm . another unique factor affect project schedule and cost be the transportation and road system that exist between the wind turbine generator manufacturing point and the wind farm site . the excessive weight of a wind turbine nacelle and the excessive length of the wind turbine blade and tower segment require special attention to transport the wind turbine generator to the wind farm site . special vehicle be require to transport wind turbine

component . road have to be select that can adequately bear the load of wind turbine part . the transportation route have to be select with adequate turn radius to accommodate the wind turbine part dimension and with adequate vertical clearance to allow wind turbine part to pass under bridge , sign , power line , and other overhead obstacle .

these transportation concern be generally address in the site selection and design process and any associate roadway improvement cost be the equivalent of preparation cost often bear by the project owner or developer . the wind turbine generator manufacturer can provide assistance in analyze the suitability of the transportation to the project site as can an engineering , procurement , and construction ( epc ) contractor . site soil composition and the presence of rock be issue that will affect construction method and cost . site soil composition have to be review to determine its tolerance for placement of tower foundation , road , and crane pad . rock locate on the wind farm site need to be evaluate to determine if it be suitable for use as aggregate for foundation of roadway and crane pad on the site . the availability of aggregate onsite and the ability to quarry the aggregate for onsite construction purpose eliminate cost associate with both acquire quarry from another location or entity and transport that aggregate to the site . however , the location of suitable aggregate may otherwise impede construction by restrict or limit access to the jobsite . thus , the soil condition and availability of aggregate on a wind farm site may trigger construction cost of compensate for inadequate soil , purchase necessary aggregate , or overcome potential delay or inefficiency in the actual construction attributable to mine and move aggregate onsite . electrical issue be also different in the construction of a wind farm . an electrical substation be require to receive power from each tower and then to step up the wind generate voltage to match the voltage in the power grid . substation placement optimally should be central to the majority of tower on the site . underground wiring should be use to connect each tower to the substation . the underground power system should be design to dissipate heat build-up so as not to damage the cable or affect their design life during transmission of the wind

generate power to the substation . also , cable to monitor individual tower performance and any other tower control cable should be trench where possible between each tower and the wind farm operational control building . site configuration will determine where to place the operational control building , but it be normally place near the main entrance to the wind farm . it be important at this point to distinguish in the construction process between the wind turbine generator and the civil and electrical work . in the construction process , the supplier of the wind turbine generator be responsible for provide the tower , the blade , the hub , the nose cone , and the power unit . the supplier of the wind turbine generator be also usually responsible for the supervisory control and datum acquisition ( scada ) system and can also be responsible for the provision of an initial spare part inventory and the possible design of any desire maintenance facility . the wind turbine supplier be also usually responsible to commission the operation of the wind turbine to demonstrate achievement of the stated performance criterion . it be important to point out that there be no standard definition of commission except for what be provide by contract or by technical datum sheet provide by the wind turbine supplier . however , the

electrical infrastructure can be test by reliance on standard electrical test recognize in the industry or require by applicable code . commission be necessary to commence the wind turbine warranty . warranty generally run from two to five year and cover lose revenue , downtime to correct fault , and an evaluation of the power curve . a wind turbine power curve be a graph indicate the individual turbine ' s electrical power output for operation at different wind speed . the power curve be generally determine by local wind field measurement . failure to achieve power curve standard be often address in a contract by the imposition of liquidate damage .

the wind farm civil work and electrical work be usually refer to as the balance of plant ( bop ) and be provide by a contractor different from the wind turbine supplier . bop civil engineering scope of work include road and drainage , crane pad , turbine foundation , meteorological mast foundation , and building for electrical switch gear , scada equipment , and a maintenance / spare part facility . bop electrical work scope include point of connection equipment to feed the wind farm ' s power generation into the electrical grid , underground cable network and overhead transmission line , electrical switch gear to protect and / or disconnect turbine or other equipment from the system , transformer and switch for individual turbine unless locate within the turbine and provide by the turbine supplier , and ground and connection for control room , maintenance facility , and any other building onsite . this difference in responsibility between the wind turbine supplier and the bop contractor be the topic of some debate regard selection of the proper project delivery system for a wind farm . project developer generally use epc contractor as the entity to design a wind farm project and manage construction through the commission phase . the epc contractor would be responsible for contract with the wind turbine supplier and with any bop contractor . however , this arrangement expose the epc contractor to damage should the wind turbine fail from a performance or delivery perspective . additionally , the wind turbine generator represent a high percentage of project cost without provision of an appropriate markup available to the epc contractor . that be because the wind turbine be commonly ship , erect , and commission by the wind turbine supplier and not by epc contractor personnel . thus , epc contractor have begin to perceive a disproportionate risk / reward ratio in contracting with the turbine supplier , encourage some movement to a project delivery system where the

developer contract with the wind turbine supplier directly , instead of through the epc contractor . construction issue relate to wind farm site selection be also affect by other issue unique to the selected parcel . construction may be affect by land use restriction or zoning issue , such as hunting right , grazing right , and cultural issue . additionally , wildlife issue may restrict construction due to bird or bat migration , wildlife migration , spawn issue , wetland and surface water issue . last , noise or visual obstruction restriction may affect placement of turbine or hour of construction operation . construction of wind turbine farm be greatly affect by site selection . though these issue be relatively new in the unite state , there be well develop practice within the wind turbine and wind farm industry develop in other country and adopt within the unite state to address constructability concern . so , despite all of the publicity relate to wind farm site selection regard zoning , permit , environmental concern , and community reaction , the construction industry be capable of construct a wind farm in the face of multiple site specific issue .

embrace the revolution - myth and fact of wind energy wind energy myth and fact myth : ten of thousand of wind turbine will be clutter the British countryside fact : government legislation require that by @card@ , @card@ % of electricity supply must come from renewable source . wind power be currently the most cost effective renewable energy technology in a position to help do that . around @card@ , @card@ additional modern wind turbine be all that would be need to deliver @card@ % of the uk ' s electricity by @card@ , roughly @card@ , @card@ onshore and @card@ , @card@ offshore . myth : wind farm won ' t help climate change fact : wind power be a clean , renewable source of energy which produce no greenhouse gas emission or waste product . the uk currently emit @card@ million tonne of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) , the key greenhouse gas culprit , every year and the government target be to cut this by @card@ % by @card@ . power station be the large contributor to carbon emission , produce @card@ million tonne of co2 each year . we need to switch to form of energy that do not produce co2 . just one modern wind turbine will save over @card@ , @card@ tonne of co2 emission annually . myth : build a wind farm take more energy than it ever make fact : the average wind farm will pay back the energy use in its manufacture within @card@ month of operation . this compare favourably with coal or nuclear power station , which take about six month . a modern wind turbine be design to operate for more than @card@ year and at the end of its work life , the area can be restore at low financial and environmental cost . wind energy be a form of development which be essentially reversible - in contrast to fossil fuel or nuclear power station . myth : wind farm be inefficient and only work @card@ % of the time fact : a modern wind turbine produce electricity @card@ % of the time , but it generate different output depend on the wind speed . over the course of a year , it will typically generate about @card@ % of the theoretical maximum output . this be know as its load factor . the load factor of conventional power station be on average @card@ % . a modern wind turbine will generate enough to meet the electricity demand of more than a thousand home over the course of a year . myth : wind energy need back-up to work fact : all form of power generation require back up and no energy technology can be rely upon @card@ % . the uk ' s transmission system already operate with enough back-up to manage the instantaneous loss of a large power station . variation in the output from wind farm be barely noticeable over and above the normal fluctuation in supply and demand , see when the nation ' S workforce go home , or if lightning bring down a high-voltage transmission line . therefore , at present there be no need for additional back-up because of wind energy . even for wind power to provide @card@ % of our nation ' s electricity need , only a small amount of additional conventional back-up would be require , in the region of @card@ megawatt ( mw ) . this would add only @card@ pence per kilowatt hour to the generation cost of wind energy and would not in any way threaten the security of our grid . in fact , this be unlikely to become a significant issue until wind generate over @card@ % of total electricity supply . myth : install wind farm will never shut down power station fact : the simple fact be that power plant in the uk be be shut down , either through European legislation on emission or sheer old age . we need to act now to find replacement power source : wind be an abundant resource , indigenous to the uk and therefore have a vital role to play in the new energy portfolio . myth : wind power be expensive fact : the cost of generate electricity from wind have fall dramatically over the past few year . between @card@ and @card@ , world wind energy capacity double every three year and with every doubling price fall by @card@ % . wind energy be competitive with new coal and new nuclear capacity , even before any environmental cost of fossil fuel and nuclear generation be take into account . the average cost of generate electricity from onshore wind be now around 3-4p per kilowatt hour , competitive with new coal ( 2.5-4.5p ) and cheap than new nuclear ( 4-7p ) . as gas price increase and wind power cost fall - both of which be very likely - wind become even more competitive , so much so that some time after @card@ wind should challenge gas as the low cost power source . furthermore , wind be a free and widely available fuel source , therefore once the wind farm be in place , there be no fuel or waste related cost . myth : the uk should invest in other renewable energy technology and energy efficiency instead of wind power fact : wind energy ' s role in combat climate change be not a matter of either / or . the Uk will need a mix of new and existing renewable energy technology and energy efficiency measure , and as quickly as possible . significant amount of investment have be allocate for wave and tidal energy development , and these technology , along with solar and biomass energy , will have an important role in the uk ' s future energy mix . however , wind energy be the most cost effective renewable energy technology available to generate clean electricity and help combat climate change right now . furthermore , develop a strong wind industry will facilitate other renewable technology which have not reach commercialisation yet , accumulate valuable experience in deal with issue such as grid connection , supply chain and finance . myth : wind farm should all be put out at sea fact : we will need a mix of both onshore and offshore wind energy to meet the uk ' s challenging target on climate change . at present , onshore wind be more economical than development offshore . however , more offshore wind farm be now under construction , with the first of the large-scale project operational at the end of @card@ , and price will fall as the industry gain more experience . furthermore , offshore wind farm take longer to develop , as the sea be inherently a more hostile environment . to expect offshore to be the only form of wind generation allow would therefore be to condemn us to miss our renewable energy target and commitment to tackle climate change . myth : wind farm be ugly and unpopular fact : beauty be in the eye of the beholder , and whether you think a wind turbine be attractive or not will always be your personal opinion . however , study regularly show that most people find turbine an interesting feature of the landscape . on average @card@ % of the public support wind energy , less than @card@ % be against it , with the remainder undecided . survey conduct since the early 1990s across the country near exist wind farm have consistently find that most people be in favour of wind energy , with support increase among those living closer to the wind farm . myth : wind farm negatively affect tourism fact : there be no evidence to suggest this . the uk ' s first commercial wind farm at delabole receive @card@ , @card@ visitor in its first ten year of operation , while @card@ , @card@ visitor a year come to take the turbine tour at the ecotech centre in swaffham , norfolk . a mori poll in Scotland show that @card@ % of tourist would be interested in visit a wind farm . wind farm developer be often ask to provide visitor centre , view platform and right of way to their site . myth : wind farm harm property price fact : there be currently no evidence in the uk show that wind farm impact negatively upon house price . however , there be evidence follow a comprehensive study by the Scottish executive that those living nearest to wind farm be their strong advocate . myth : wind farm kill bird fact : the rspb state in its @card@ information leaflet wind farm and bird , that " in the uk , we have not so far witness any major adverse effect on bird associate with wind farm " . wind farm be always subject to an environmental impact assessment and bwea member follow the industry ' s good practice guideline and work closely with organisation such as English nature and the rspb to ensure that wind farm design and layout do not interfere with sensitive specie or wildlife designate site . moreover , a recent report publish in the journal nature confirm that the great threat to bird population in the uk be climate change . myth : wind farm be dangerous to human fact : wind energy be a benign technology with no associate emission , harmful pollutant or waste product . in over @card@ year and with more than @card@ , @card@ machine install around the world , no member of the public have ever be harm by the normal operation of wind turbine . in response to recent unscientific accusation that wind turbine emit infrasound and cause associate health problem , Dr geoff leventhall , consultant in noise vibration and acoustics and author of the defra report on low frequency noise and its effect , say : " i can state quite categorically that there be no significant infrasound from current design of wind turbine . to say that there be an infrasound problem be one of the hare which objector to wind farm like to run . there will not be any effect from infrasound from the turbine . " myth : wind farm be noisy fact : the evolution of wind farm technology over the past decade have render mechanical noise from turbine almost undetectable with the main sound be the aerodynamic swoosh of the blade pass the tower . there be strict guideline on wind turbine and noise emission to ensure the protection of residential amenity . these be contain in the scientifically inform etsu work group guideline @card@ and must be follow by wind farm developer , as reference in national planning policy for renewables . the good advice for any doubter be to go and hear for yourself ! note the " average modern wind turbine ' refer to in this document have a rate capacity of @card@ megawatt ( mw ) onshore . datum on consent project and application currently be progress show that this will increase to over @card@ mw in the near future . offshore , turbine currently be installed be rate at @card@ mw , and it be expect that this will rise to a typical @card@ mw per machine by @ord@ reference energy white paper ( @card@ ) , our energy future - create a low carbon economy , available online at hyperlink ` ` http : / / replaced-dns / energy / whitepaper / replaced-dns ' ' replaced-dns / energy / whitepaper / replaced-dns dti ( @card@ ) , dukes , annex e - energy and the environment , available at hyperlink ` ` http : / / replaced-dns / energy / inform / dukes / dukes2004 / replaced-dns ' ' replaced-dns / energy / inform / dukes / dukes2004 / replaced-dns bwea calculation at hyperlink ` ` http : / / replaced-dns / edu / replaced-dns ' ' replaced-dns / edu / replaced-dns milborrow , dispel the myth of energy payback time , as publish in windstats , vol @card@ , no @card@ ( spring @card@ ) . dti ( @card@ ) , digest of unite kingdom energy statistic @card@ , table @card@ plant load , demand and efficiency , available online at hyperlink ` ` http : / / replaced-dns / energy / inform / energy_stats / electricity / dukes5_10.xls ' ' http : / / replaced-dns / energy / inform / energy_stats / electricity / dukes5_10.xls see the carbon trust and dti ( @card@ ) , renewables network impact study and national grid ( @card@ ) , seven year statement , available online at hyperlink ` ` http : / / replaced-dns / carbontrust / about / publication / renewables network impact study replaced-dns ' ' replaced-dns / carbontrust / about / publication / renewables network impact study replaced-dns and hyperlink ` ` http : / / replaced-dns / Uk / library / document / sys_04 / replaced-dns ? snode = sys & action = & exp = y ' ' replaced-dns / Uk / library / document / sys_04 / replaced-dns ? snode = sys & action = & exp = y respectively milborrow ( @card@ ) , the economics of wind energy , wren international seminar externe ( @card@ ) external cost , research result on socio-environmental damage due to electricity and transport , available online at hyperlink ` ` http : / / replaced-dns / replaced-dns ' ' replaced-dns / replaced-dns see piu ( @card@ ) , renewables innovation review , available online at hyperlink ` ` http : / / replaced-dns / energy / renewables / policy / replaced-dns ' ' replaced-dns / energy / renewables / policy / replaced-dns ; Hansard , @card@ June @card@ , column 1225w , available online at hyperlink ` ` http : / / replaced-dns / pa / cm200304 / cmhansrd / cm040621 / text / @card@ replaced-dns ' ' replaced-dns / pa / cm200304 / cmhansrd / cm040621 / text / @card@ replaced-dns ; oxera ( @card@ ) , the non-market value of generation technology ; oxera ( @card@ ) , result of renewables market model ; dti ( @card@ ) , economics paper no @card@ ; and milborrow d , become respectable in serious circle , windpower monthly , Jan @card@ rba ( @card@ ) , stroud district resident survey , rba for triodos bank , the Gloucestershire water & energy forum , bwea and western windpower . for late national study , please see tns ( @card@ ) , attitude and knowledge of renewable energy amongst the general public , on behalf of : department of trade and industry , Scottish executive , national assembly for wale and department of enterprise , trade and investment northern ireland .

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page @card@ natural resource canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august @card@ , @card@ @ord@ introduction and summary

Howe gastmeier chapnik limit ( hgc engineering ) be retain by natural resource canada to assess the environmental noise impact from the pubnico point wind farm in nova scotia . the pubnico point wind farm have be operate seventeen vesta @card@ mw wind turbine generator on the southern tip of the point for the past year . residence be locate north of the wind farm , along highway @ord@ a residential neighbour , mr. Daniel d ' entremont , have express concern regard the sound impact his property , which be adjacent to the wind farm and about @card@ metre from the close wind turbine generator . his concern relate to the audibility of the sound produce by the wind turbine generator , particularly when the wind be from the south as note in an undated letter to department of natural resource canada : " when light to moderate wind be blow the noise towards our house it be at its loud . sometimes the fog seem to amplify the noise " . during discussion on site , mr. d ' entremont also express concern about the potential for adverse effect of infrasound - pressure fluctuation at a frequency below that which the human ear can discern - due to the operation of the wind turbine generator . engineer from hgc engineering visit the site during the period from may @card@ to @card@ , @card@ to measure the sound impact of the wind turbine generator at the residence most impact by the wind farm , at another residential location further to the north , and within the wind farm . the acoustical measurement be conduct use a number of technique include longer-term monitoring of the overall a-weighted decibel level , detailed real time frequency analysis in @card@ / @card@ octave band , and discrete frequency spectral analysis . measurement be conduct over the typical audible frequency range and in the infrasonic range . record of wind condition be obtain through the pubnico point wind farm , and supplement with environment canada datum from yarmouth .

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page @card@ natural resource canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august @card@ , @card@ acoustical model be complete to correlate the level measure at various point of reception to sound power datum estimate from measurement conduct near the wind turbine generator . the measure and model result have be compare to the criterion present in the ontario ministry of the environment ' S ( moe ) publication npc-232 sound level limit for stationary source in class @card@ area ( rural ) and interpretation of apply moe npc technical publication to wind turbine generator . additional guideline for assess and investigate noise from wind turbine generator have be obtain from various international technical paper . the ontario guideline be use in this assessment since the province of nova scotia do not presently publish technical guideline for assess the acoustic impact of wind turbine generator on residence . the result of the monitoring indicate that the sound of the operate wind turbine generator be clearly audible at the residence of mr. Daniel d ' entremont ( hereafter , the d ' entremont residence ) , and confirm mr. d ' entremont ' s impression that the impact be greatest when the wind be from the south and the humidity be high . datum from the automatic sound level monitor deploy at the d ' entremont residence indicate that , much of the time , the sound level be not significantly above the typical background sound level expect at the particular wind speed . however , the data also indicate that the sound level from the wind turbine generator can exceed the background sound level in the area by up to @card@ db under certain wind and atmospheric condition , most notably light wind from the south . at the d ' entremont residence , the dominant acoustic impact of the wind turbine generator take the form of a constantly repeat " swoosh ' noise produce by the rotate turbine blade . the sound be relatively broadband , with no clear tonal characteristic , and the amplitude be modulate at the blade pass frequency of @card@ hz . the " swoosh ' make identification of the wind turbine generator sound fairly easy , and observation and the measurement indicate that the impact of the wind farm be continually audible to vary degree depend on operational and atmospheric condition .

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page @card@ natural resource canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august @card@ , @card@ sound at infrasonic frequency be not present at perceptible level near the wind turbine generator nor at the d ' entremont residence and it be conclude that infrasound be not an issue . this conclusion agree with internationally recognize research on the low frequency sound produce by wind turbine generator . an analytical assessment of the impact suggest that the sound level produce by the wind farm do not exceed the applicable criterion of the ontario ministry of the environment ( moe ) . however , this conclusion be base on assessment methodology appropriate under the standard , although it rely on an estimate of the wind turbine generator sound power at a single wind speed of about @card@ m / s rather than on the manufacturer ' s sound power datum for all wind speed , as specify by the standard . the moe evaluation procedure rely on a model of acoustic dispersion which be generally favourable for the propagation of sound from a source to a receptor , but do not consider specific environmental condition or effect , and do not purport to define a sound level impact under a worst-case atmospheric condition . an expanded predictive assessment , undertake by hgc engineering to investigate the influence of specific atmospheric and wind condition in great detail , confirm that the operation of the wind turbine generator can contribute to sound level exceed the applicable criterion , although such a prediction methodology be outside the approach prescribe by the moe . in conclusion , the sound of the wind turbine generator be continually audible at the d ' entremont residence , but much of the time be not appreciably above the numeric criterion derive under the guideline of the ontario ministry of the environment . however , under certain wind and atmospheric condition - most notably when there be light wind from the south and the humidity be high - the sound level impact of the wind turbine generator be significantly great than the background sound level .

there be no specific technical guideline for assess the acoustic impact of wind turbine generator on residential property publish by the province of nova scotia . consequently natural resource canada suggest that the noise guideline of the ontario ministry of the environment ( moe ) form the basis of this assessment . as the moe guideline describe a comprehensive approach to the measurement and assessment of industrial noise in general , and cover wind turbine generator specifically , these guideline be adopt as the primary basis of this assessment . the moe guideline be available at the ministry website.1 specifically , moe guideline npc-232 sound level limit for stationary source in class @card@ area ( rural ) provide general assessment guideline for industrial noise impact a sensitive land use such as a residential area in an acoustically rural location . an acoustically rural area have sound level generally dominate by natural sound , other than the industrial noise source under consideration . during site visit conduct by hgc engineering , it be clear that most of the time , the background sound at the residence in the vicinity of the wind farm be indeed set by natural sound such as the wind act on tree , bird , etc . the moe guideline consider one-hour energy equivalent average sound level ( designate as leq ) , rather than instantaneous sound level , in unit of a-weighted decibel ( dba ) . the human ear have a sensitivity to the loudness of sound which vary depend on the frequency of a sound , and be most sensitive around @card@ hertz ( hz ) . the a-weighting system be use to approximate this vary sensitivity . npc-232 indicate that the applicable sound level limit for a stationary source of sound be the background sound level . however , where background sound level be low , exclusionary

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page @card@ natural resource canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august @card@ , @card@ conclusion that the residence and wind farm be locate in an acoustically rural area under moe guideline . this be particularly clear during the calm interval in the " first period " where at about @card@ : @card@ on may @card@ there be no wind and the sound level briefly fall as low as @card@ dba . 3 ) during much of the " first period " , the wind be generally from the southwest through south , at about @card@ m / S , indicate that the wind turbine generator be near the cut-in limit of @card@ m / S . high humidity level also occur during this period . during these condition , at two distinct interval ( between about @card@ : @card@ on may @card@ to about @card@ : @card@ on may @card@ , and again from about @card@ : @card@ on may @card@ to @card@ : @card@ on may @card@ ) the measure sound level exceed the criterion of interpretation by a significant amount , peak at an excess of @card@ db . these period agree well with mr. d ' entremont ' S observation . there be a number of potential hypothesis which could account for these excess , but further effort would be require to identify the precise cause . 4 ) much of the time , specifically the " second period " interval from about @card@ : @card@ on may 7th to about @card@ : @card@ on may 8th , the wind be generally in the range of @card@ to @card@ m / S , with vary wind direction but wind originate predominantly from the northwest through the east . during this period , and at the end of this period when the wind be from the south between @card@ and @card@ m / S , the measure sound level be generally at the criterion of interpretation . it may be conclude that much of the time , the acoustic impact of the wind turbine generator be acceptable under interpretation . 5 ) during the " third period " the wind begin to rise to near gale force , cause high background sound level due to the action of the wind in the tree and other vegetation .

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page @card@ natural resource canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august @card@ , @card@ subjective audibility to assess the audibility of the wind turbine generator at the d ' entremont residence , a variety of observation and acoustic measurement be conduct . figure 4a be base on a continuous series of @card@ / @card@ second duration spectral measurement make near the wind turbine generator . the horizontal axis represent a 20-second time window , and the vertical axis indicate frequency , which span from @card@ hz to @card@ hz in this case . colour represent the a-weighted sound level , with warm colour indicate high level . the vertical band in the chart illustrate a repetitive " swoosh ' sound characteristic of wind turbine generator . the three-bladed wind turbine , rotate at about @card@ rpm , have a blade pass frequency of about @card@ hz . thus , over @card@ second , about @card@ " swoosh ' sound would be expect , and can be see in figure 4a . the influence of the " swoosh ' be clear at midband frequency , centre at about @card@ hz , where the amplitude modulate by about @card@ db . it be important to realize that while the amplitude of sound in the typically audible range be modulate at a low frequency rate , this do not indicate or imply that the sound have acoustic content in this low frequency range . low frequency modulation of the sound level should not be confuse with low frequency sound . other than the " swoosh ' , the sound of the turbine be not observe to be appreciably tonal or to have other identify characteristic . figure 4b illustrate a similar @card@ second time period , but the measurement be conduct at the d ' entremont residence . the influence of more than one wind turbine generator can be see , in that there be more amplitude peak than in figure 4a , but it be clear from the graph that the characteristic " swoosh ' sound be clearly discernable at the residence ; the sound of the wind turbine generator , while fairly broadband , be not continuous " white ' noise . during this measurement , as with the previous measurement , wind be from the northwest at approximately @card@ m / S as measure at the close wind turbine generator , which do not appear to be particularly favourable condition for sound level impact of the wind turbine generator on the d ' entremont residence . this demonstrate that even when the sound level be at a relatively low magnitude , and in line with moe criterion , the sound be audible at the d ' entremont residence .

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page @card@ natural resource canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august @card@ , @card@ in summary , the measurement and observation indicate that the sound of the wind turbine generator can be describe as have the characteristic " swoosh ' sound typical of wind turbine generator . no tone or other identify sound be note . the measurement and observation indicate that the wind turbine generator be continually audible at the d ' entremont residence to vary degree which depend on operational and atmospheric condition . infrasound as state previously in this report , wind and the action of wave generate infrasonic noise . infrasound be thus present throughout the environment , and can generally be measure anywhere . this observation be significant as it indicate that in the absence of the wind turbine generator , sound at infrasonic frequency would still be present in the pubnico area . to provide an idea of the magnitude of infrasound in the area , measurement of sound at infrasonic frequency be conduct near to an operate wind turbine generator and adjacent to the d ' entremont residence . the measured sound spectra be illustrate in figure @ord@ as show , the infrasonic sound near the wind turbine generator be low and not find to be appreciably different from that at the d ' entremont residence . it can be conclude that the wind turbine generator be not the dominant source of infrasonic sound in the area . because of the broadband nature of the measure infrasound , a precise comparison of the measure spectra to the pure tone threshold of perception show in with a dash line in figure @card@ can not be make . tone be easy for human to identify than broadband sound , but no tone be observe . additionally , the measured level be conservative in that they may be overstate due to wind-induced turbulence at the microphone . however , ignore these influence , it be clear that the infrasound measure in the area near the pubnico point wind farm be well below the threshold of perception .

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page @card@ natural resource canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august @card@ , @card@ these finding agree well with the finding of a recent paper4 publish in the journal of the Canadian acoustical association , which conclude that " infrasound from wind turbine generator be below the audible threshold and of no consequence . " @ord@ model methodology and result

the moe standard interpretation be an analytical , prediction-based standard rather than an assessment method base on receptor measurement . it be not completely appropriate to compare a measure impact at a specific moment in time to a criterion determine under the standard , as the standard indicate that calculation be make use the assumed meteorological condition of iso @card@ , acoustics - attenuation of sound during propagation outdoors - part @card@ : general method of calculation which be generally favourable to the propagation of sound from a source to a receptor , but do not consider specific environmental condition or effect , and do not purport to define a sound level impact under a worst-case atmospheric condition . to provide a more appropriate assessment of the impact of the pubnico point wind farm , hgc engineering have model the result noise impact at the residential receptor as describe below . interpretation specify that the source sound datum to be use should be provide by the equipment manufacturer , and should be obtain accord to iec @card@ , wind turbine generator system - part @card@ : acoustic noise measurement technique . however , due to confidentiality concern , the manufacturer ' S datum have not be use in this assessment . short-duration measurement be conduct on various side of wind turbine generator number @card@ and numb @card@ at a distance of @card@ metre from the wind turbine generator tower in order to estimate the sound power of the wind turbine generator . the measurement occur from about @card@ : @card@ to @card@ : @card@ on may @card@ , and the wind speed record during this period be about @card@

appendix a : vesta v80 @card@ mw wind turbine generator datum

v80-1.8 mw
versatile megawattage

this system feature microprocessor that rotate the blade around their longitudinal axe , thus ensure continuous adjustment to maintain optimal blade angle in relation to the prevailing wind . at the same time , optitip ® make it possible to keep sound level within the limit stipulate by local regulation .

optimal output
another factor that help to maximize the efficiency and optimize the sound level of the v80 be optislip ® technology . the optislip ® generator allow the turbine rotor speed to vary between @card@ and @card@ rpm , depend on condition . while the technology involve may be advanced , its purpose be simple : to optimize output . it do this by tap the high efficiency of slow and variable rotation , store excess energy in rotational form and exploit the full force of transient gust . all tell , optislip ® boost annual energy production by around five per cent in relation to traditional fixed-speed turbine . as an added benefit , optislip ® also reduce wear and tear on the gearbox , blade and tower on account of low peak loading . moreover , as turbine sound be a function of wind speed , the low rotation speed make possible by optislip ® naturally reduce sound level . finally , optislip ® help the v80 deliver good quality power to the grid , with rapid synchronization , reduce harmonic distortion and less flicker . quite simply , the v80-1.8 mw turbine be synonymous with more output , good quality power and less mechanical strain and sound .

top of its class
the vesta v80 have be engineer to make the very most of aggressive site , as it provide unparallelled productivity in both high and moderate wind . in term of power output and sweep area , it be the good turbine on the market in the @card@ mw class . more than @card@ , @card@ of these turbine have already be install around the world , and have prove themselves to be seasoned performer in both onshore and offshore environment . the high energy yield of the v80 make it an excellent choice for location where space be limit . however , it also boast an excellent track record in challenge offshore condition , where its high operational availability , excellent grid compliance and proven technology make it a competitive choice with respect to both cost and performance . one of the factor that contribute to the superior performance of the v80 be optitip ® , its pitch regulation system .

proven performance
wind power plant require substantial investment , and the process can be very complex . to assist in the evaluation and purchasing process , vesta have identify four factor that be critical to wind turbine quality : energy production , operational availability , power quality and sound level . we spend month test and document these performance area for all vesta turbine . when we be finally satisfy , we ask an independent testing organisation to verify the result - a practice we call proven performance . at vesta we do not just talk about quality . we prove it .

the figure above illustrate the relationship between wind and sound level , and that between wind and speed of revolution for turbine equip with optispeed ® . it clearly show the sound level advantage of low speed of revolution because the beneficial effect on sound level of low speed of revolution be approximately @card@ db ( a ) low at @card@ m / S than at @card@ m / S . for other sound level , the benefit can be as much as @card@ db ( a ) . please note that a decrease of @card@ db ( a ) be a halve of the sound level .

the sound output level can be adjust by vary the revolution speed of the turbine as illustrate in the figure above . in practice , this mean that , for example , the sound level record at a distance of @card@ m ( hub height @card@ m ) can be reduce from @card@ to @card@ db ( a ) - i.e. . by more than half the recorded level .

optislip ® allow the rotor speed to vary within a range of approximately @card@ percent in relation to nominal rpm . this minimize both unwanted fluctuation in the output to the grid supply and the load on the vital part of the construction .

versatile megawattage

in many field of engineering , flexibility and efficiency be consider almost diametric opposite - i.e. . one can only be improve at the expense of the other . at vesta , we specialize in find way to improve both at the same time . to see how we accomplish this , you need look no further than the v80 , the cornerstone of our @card@ mw class . the v80 be a pitch-regulated turbine for medium and high wind that feature optislip ® variable-speed technology . optislip ® allow the rotor speed to vary within a range of approximately @card@ percent in relation to nominal rpm . optislip ® thereby significantly increase productivity and make it possible to keep sound level within the limit stipulate by local regulation .

this flexibility , enhance by a variety of tower height , make the v80 particularly well suit to a wide range of site . together with optitip ® , our pitch-regulation system , optislip ® give the v80 a competitive edge in its megawatt class . this edge , back by vesta ' reputation for dependability , superior project management and service , have make the v80 one of the best-selling turbine in the world . the popularity of the turbine mean that we be able to keep production cost - and hence your cost per kwh - to a minimum . it be just one more way in which the versatility of the v80 lead to increase efficiency .

" this area have far too many home to attempt the safe site of an industrial wind farm . it be noticeably evident from the follow datum that the great part of rural manitowoc county be not suitable for the site of commercial wind energy development . the only way to mitigate incident with noise , ice fling , flicker , blade throw , turbine collapse , and turbine fire be to implement adequate safety setback . safety standard advocate by the wind industry be ridiculously inadequate and benefit no one but themselves . " i ' m passionate about this because i firmly believe wind power be part of the solution and not a problem , as some people think , " sagrillo say , " but that solution have get to be acceptable to the neighborhood . you can ' t just force thing down people ' throat . " ( source-facing the replaced-dns / news ) different setback for inhabit structure have be propose , depend on whether the inhabit structure belong to a landowner who be lease land to the wind project . again this distinction have no bearing on public health and safety , and should therefore not be allow . in other word , if @card@ foot be necessary to protect one citizen , it be necessary for all citizen , whether or not they be receive lease payment . ( source-8 / @card@ / @card@ state model wind ordinance ) if @card@ foot be necessary for safety , i have the right to be safe in my home and anywhere on my property . windrights windustry -turbines should be site no less than five-times their rotor diameter from property line , unless write permission be give by the neighbor . explanation : this recommendation be design to protect wind right of all landowner and minimize the impact of wind turbine on neighbor . wind turbine produce wake effect @card@ rotor diameter downwind . require a setback of @card@ rotor diameter from property line provide a buffer that will protect the wind right of all landowner in the vicinity of a wind project . we believe clear standard for property line setback be critical to prevent dispute over wind right now and in the future . without standard , conflict among neighbor and among wind developer can arise .

renewable energy law encourage free competition between power plant in order to lower the cost of power production and thereby electricity tariff . however , since a majority of power plant in turkey be still state-owned , turkey can control supply and hence influence price . overall , competition for " must run " wind farm be difficult because they can not control their output in response to market demand , contrary to conventional power plant ( which can adapt generation to actual demand ) . in view of these argument , propose project electricity tariff can not increase by @card@ % , and as such the @card@ % benchmark be unlikely to be reach this way . annual electricity generation : the annual electricity generation use to calculate the equity irr be base on the mircositing study of the project ( @card@ , @card@ mwh ) . in this study , under the bad and good case scenario , the electricity generation will not fluctuate above or below @card@ % the adopt generation level as summarize in table @ord@ therefore , a @card@ % increase in annually generate el4ectricity be highly unlikely . project net annual electricity production ( aep ) @card@

accord to table @card@ , the majority of the project already operate be either : - significantly small than the osmaniye rotor elektrik project ; - build operate transfer ( bot ) project , hence face less technological and investment barrier than the propose project ; or - operate under voluntary carbon emission reduction standard ( such as the gold standard ) . no wind farm of a comparable size to the project activity have be build in turkey , and no windfarm large than 10mw have be build in the absence of carbon finance . therefore the project activity be the first of its kind , and would not be viable without carbon credit financing . sub-step 4b . discuss any similar option that be occur

as detailed in table @card@ , the wind farm connect to the national grid differ from the propose project in installed capacity and operation practice ( i.e. . operate as bot plant and not privately own ) . the remain project that be comparable to the project activity in term of installed capacity be be develop as ver project . thus , no similar option remain , indicate that wind farm of similar output to the propose project at osmaniye be far from be common practice in turkey unless they be voluntary carbon offset project . it be therefore fair and conservative to conclude that the project be the first of its kind in turkey , be not common practice , and can therefore be consider additional .

introduction :
the demand for energy have increase in tremendous proportion in the last few decade in pakistan ; the same be expect to increase further in the come year . the primary source of energy available in pakistan be oil , natural gas , hydro and nuclear power . at present oil account for approximately @card@ % of total commercial energy supply . the share of natural gas be @card@ % while that of hydel power remain roughly at @card@ % . the increase in cost of fossil fuel and the various environmental problem of large scale power generation have lead to increase appreciation of the potential of electricity generation from non-conventional source . this have provide the planner and economist to find out other low cost energy resource . wind and solar energy be the possible clean and low cost renewable resource available in the country . the potential , for the use of alternative technology , have never be fully explore in pakistan . wind power provide opportunity to reduce dependence on import fossil fuel and at the same time expand the power supply capacity to remote location where grid expansion be not practical . recently conduct survey of wind power potential along coastal area of the country by pakistan meteorological department ( pmd ) , indicate that a potential exist for harvest wind energy use currently available technology , especially along sindh coast . gharo , one of the site in sindh where the wind datum have be record and study by pmd , have be select for this feasibility study . the wind measurement at gharo have be carry out during @card@ month period . the annual mean wind speed be estimate to be 6.86m / S at @card@ meter above ground level . the annual power density of area be @card@ w / m2 , which bring the site into good category of power potential , which mean this area be suitable for large economically viable wind farm . use the measure wind datum the annual gross energy production by an @card@ mw wind farm consist of thirty - @card@ kw turbine will be @card@ million kwh . take into account the wind turbine availability , net loss and wake effect in the wind farm the net annual energy production be estimate to @card@ million kwh per year corresponding to a capacity factor of @card@ % . the total investment will be rs : @card@ million and pay back period will be @card@ year . the capital cost of wind power project range rs @card@ to5 crore per mw . this give a levelised cost of wind energy generation in the range of rs : @card@ to @card@ per kwh , take into consideration the fiscal benefit extend by the government .

wind power production
there be two term to describe basic electricity production . @ord@ efficiency , @ord@ capacity factor . efficiency refer to how much useful energy ( electricity , in this case ) we can get from an energy source . a @card@ percent energy efficient machine would change all the energy put into it into useful energy . it would not waste any energy . there be no such thing as a @card@ percent energy efficient machine . some energy be always lose or waste when one form of energy be convert to another . the lose energy be usually in the form of heat , which dissipate into the air and can not be use again economically . how efficient be wind machine ? wind machine be just as efficient as most other plant , such as coal plant . wind machine convert @card@ percent of the wind ' s kinetic energy into electricity . a coal-fired power plant convert about @card@ percent of the chemical energy in coal into usable electricity . capacity refer to the capability of a power plant to produce electricity . a power plant with a @card@ percent capacity rating would run all day , every day at full power . there would be no down time for repair or refuel , an impossible goal for any plant . coal plant typically have a @card@ percent capacity rating since they can run day or night , during any season of the year . wind power plant be different from power plant that burn fuel . wind plant depend on the availability of wind , as well as the speed of the wind . therefore , wind machine can not operate @card@ hour a day , @card@ day a year . a wind turbine at a typical wind farm operate @card@ percent of the time , but usually at less than full capacity , because the wind speed be not at optimum level . therefore , its capacity factor be @card@ percent . economics also play a large part in the capacity of wind machine . wind machine can be build that have much high capacity factor , but it be not economical to do so . the decision be base on electricity output per dollar of investment . capacity factor the annual energy output from a wind turbine be to look at the capacity factor for the turbine in its particular location . by capacity factor we mean its actual annual energy output divide by the theoretical maximum output , if the machine be run at its rate ( maximum ) power during all of the @card@ hour of the year . example : if a @card@ kw turbine produce @card@ million kwh in a year , its capacity factor be = @card@ : ( @card@ * @card@ * @card@ ) = @card@ : @card@ = @card@ = @card@ per cent . capacity factor may theoretically vary from @card@ to @card@ per cent , but in practice they will usually range from @card@ to @card@ per cent , and mostly be around @card@ per cent .

risk associate with investment in wind power
i . the return from investment in this sector be very dependent on government policy , both in term of the incentive give and the taxation structure impose on business . hence change in either be a source of concern to the investor . for example , change in the tax law that make all company liable to pay a minimum tax on their profit , may negatively affect the wind program because it reduce the benefit from the tax shelter that investment here could provide . ii . the main " fuel " control generation in any year be the wind speed . this be beyond the investor ' S control : there be always the risk that actual generation in any year could be below the expect level . iii . grid availability to evacuate the generate power be an essential requirement . poor grid availability and reliability be again risk that have to be bear by the investor under the current situation .

critical determinant of financial return
i . ii . iii . iv . the capacity factor of the wind turbine or wind potential of an area , the purchase price for the power generate , the term structure of the loan take for the project , the rate of interest of the loan .

give the relatively low capacity factor of wind , one might initially expect that wind ' s percentage contribution on an energy basis would be low than on a capacity basis . this be not necessarily the case , in part because even though combined-cycle gas plant can be operate as baseload facility with high capacity factor , those facility be often run as intermediate plant with capacity factor that be not dissimilar from that of wind . combustion turbine facility run at even low capacity factor . yearly and cumulative installed wind capacity in the unite state be from awea , while global wind capacity come from btm consult ( but update with the most recent awea datum for the united state ) and , for early year , from the earth policy institute . modest disagreement exist among these data source and other , e.g. . , windpower monthly and the global wind energy council . in term of actual @card@ delivery , wind represent @card@ % of net electricity generation in the unite state , and roughly @card@ % of national electricity consumption . these figure be below the @card@ % figure provide above because @card@ % be a projection base on end-of-year @card@ wind capacity .

@card@

end of @card@ , base on datum provide by awea . include here be wind project either own by or under long-term contract with these utility for use by their own customer ; short-term renewable electricity and renewable energy certificate contract be exclude . the table also list the top-20 utility base on an estimate of the percentage of retail sale that wind generation represent , use end-of-2007 wind capacity and wind capacity factor that be consistent with the state or region in which these utility operate , and eia-provided aggregate retail electricity sale for each utility in @card@ as show , three of the list utility system be estimate to have achieve in excess of @card@ % wind penetration base on this metric , while @card@ utility be estimate to have exceed @card@ % .

to estimate these figure , end-of-2007 wind capacity be translate into estimated annual wind electricity production base on state-specific capacity factor that derive from the project performance datum report later in this report . the result state-specific wind production estimate be then divide by the late datum on total in-state electricity generation available from the eia ( i.e. . , @card@ ) . the result wind penetration estimate show in table @card@ differ from what awea provide in its annual ranking report . the most significant source of these difference be that awea estimate wind generation base on endof-2006 wind capacity , while this report use end-of-2007 capacity . in addition , Berkeley lab use state-specific wind capacity factor assumption that differ from those apply by awea . a variety of caveat deserve note with respect to these calculation . first , the utility-specific capacity datum that awea release in its annual ranking report be assume accurate , and be use without independent verification . second , only utility with @card@ mw or more of wind capacity be include in the calculation of wind as a proportion of retail sale . third , projected wind generation base on each utility ' s installed wind capacity at the end of @card@ be divide by the aggregate national retail sale of that utility in @card@ ( which be the late full year of utility-specific retail sale datum provide by eia ) . fourth , in the case of generation and transmission ( g & t ) cooperative and power authority that provide power to other cooperative and municipal utility ( but do not directly serve retail load themselves ) , @card@ retail sale from the electric utility serve by those g & t cooperative and power authority be use . in some case , these individual utility may be buy additional wind power directly from other project , or may be serve by other g & t cooperative or power authority that supply wind . in these case , the penetration percentage show here may be understate ( or at least somewhat mislead ) . as an example , the " msr public power agency " ( msr ) be a joint power agency create to procure power for municipal utility in the california city of modesto , santa clara , and red . the @card@ mw of wind capacity associate with msr in the first column of table @card@ ( and the corresponding @card@ % penetration rate show in the second column ) represent msr ' s power purchase agreement with the big horn wind project in washington state . however , two of the three municipal utility participate in msr purchase additional wind power from california wind project . the result be that if one be to look at these three municipal utility individually rather than as a group through msr , their penetration rate would be considerably high than the @card@ % show in table @card@ , and all three utility would be at the top of the ranking : red would be roughly @card@ % , Santa Clara @card@ % , and modesto @card@ % . finally , some of the entity show in table @card@ be wholesale power marketing company that be affiliate with electric utility . in these case , estimated wind generation be divide by the retail sale of the power marketing company and any affiliated electric utility .

datum from interconnection queue demonstrate that an enormous amount of wind capacity be under development
one visible testament to the surging interest in wind be the amount of wind power capacity currently work its way through the major interconnection queue across the country . figure @card@ provide this information , for wind and other resource , aggregate across eleven wind-relevant independent system operator ( isos ) , regional transmission organization ( rtos ) , and utilities.8 these datum should be interpret with caution : though place a project in the interconnection queue be a necessary step in project development , be in the queue do not guarantee that a project will actually be build . in fact , there be a grow recognition that many of the project currently in interconnection queue be very early in the development process , and that a large number of these project be unlikely to achieve commercial operation any time soon , if at all.9 even with this important caveat , the amount of wind capacity in the nation ' s interconnection queue be astound , and provide

some indication of the number and capacity of project that be in the planning phase . at the end of @card@ , there be 225gw of wind power capacity within the eleven interconnection queue review for this report - more than @card@ time the installed wind capacity in the unite state at the end of @ord@ this wind capacity represent roughly half of all generate capacity within these queue at that time , and be twice as much capacity as the next-largest resource in these queue ( natural gas ) . moreover , wind ' s prominent position be a relatively recent phenomenon : @card@ % of the total wind capacity in these eleven queue at the end of @card@ first enter the queue in @card@ ( for the non-wind project , in aggregate , the comparable figure be @card@ % ) . much of this wind capacity be plan for the Midwest , texas , and pjm region : wind in the interconnection queue of miso ( @card@ gw ) , ercot ( @card@ gw ) , and pjm ( @card@ gw ) account for nearly two-third of the aggregate @card@ gw of wind in all eleven queue . at the other end of the spectrum , the northeast exhibit the least amount of wind capacity in the pipeline , with the new york iso ( @card@ gw ) and iso-new england ( @card@ gw ) together account for about @card@ % of the aggregate @card@ gw . the remain six queue include spp ( @card@ gw ) , California iso ( @card@ gw ) , wapa ( @card@ gw ) , bpa ( @card@ gw ) , Pacificorp ( 9gw ) , and xcel ' s colorado service area ( @card@ gw ) .

comfort with and use of innovative financing structure increase
a variety of innovative financing structure have be develop by the u.s. wind industry in recent year to allow project to fully access federal tax incentive . the two most common structure at the present time be corporate balance-sheet finance ( e.g. . , historically use by fpl energy ) and the " institutional investor flip " structure involve institutional " tax equity " investors.15 with the record-shattering amount of new wind capacity install in @card@ and the grow presence of foreign developer and owner with little appetite for u.s. tax incentive , @card@ the need to attract institutional tax equity to the u.s. wind sector have never be great . the past year have bring both good and bad news on this front . the wind industry receive welcome news in October @card@ , when the irs issue " safe harbor " guideline ( i.e. . , revenue procedure @card@ ) for wind project utilize special-allocation partnership flip structure . although various permutation of these type of structure have be use for a number of year to monetize the tax benefit provide to wind project , tax equity investor have have to absorb the risk that these deal would be challenge by the irs . revenue procedure @card@ effectively remove this structural tax risk for project that adhere to the prescribed investment and allocation limit , and have , through numerical example , legitimize the institutional investor flip structure.17 comfort with this structure have grow to the point where even fpl energy - which have finance the large fleet of wind project in the unite state primarily on its balance sheet - conduct its first ever project refinancing use third-party tax equity in late @ord@ while this event spark rumor that the u.s. wind giant be run out of tax credit appetite , fpl ' s own explanation be more benign : the institutional investor flip structure allow fpl to focus on its core strength - develop and operate wind project - while capitalize on the relatively low cost of institutional tax equity ( pre-flip ) and retain long-term upside potential ( post-flip ) . the year @card@ also see the closing of a first-of-its-kind tax equity structure suitable for municipality and cooperative interested in long-term wind project ownership . the 205-mw white creek wind project be develop by four publicly own , tax-exempt utility in the pacific northwest , in cooperation with several institutional tax investor . by serve as power purchaser and pre-paying ( up-front )

for the minimum projected electricity output of the project over its initial @card@ year of project operation , these four publicly own utility effectively enable the project to take advantage of low-cost tax-exempt debt ( use to finance the pre-payment ) as well as the traditional tax benefit afford to wind project ( available to the institutional tax investor ) . a post-flip buyout option allow for long-term ownership by the publicly own utility . although institutional tax investor be plentiful in @card@ , with more than a dozen active in the market , @card@ the growing dependence on such third-party investor have leave the u.s. wind sector vulnerable to the broad credit crisis that begin in earnest towards the end of @ord@ as a result of the large loss incur by the banking industry , institutional tax investor have less taxable income to shelter . this shortage be already be feel in the affordable housing sector - one of the wind sector ' s main competitor for tax equity - where the yield on affordable housing credit have be drive sharply high by lack of demand . it remain to be see whether lackluster tax investor demand will spill over into the wind sector , but at the very least it seem unlikely that the cost of tax equity provide to wind project will continue to fall in @ord@ this be particularly notable because the sizable decline in the cost of tax equity over the past four or five year have partially offset ( by roughly @card@ % , accord to Berkeley lab analysis ) the impact of rise turbine and installed project cost on wind power price . to the extent that the cost of tax equity have bottom out or begin to rise , any further project cost increase will be feel more immediately and severely in wind power price . finally , project-level debt stage a comeback of sort in @card@ , with a number of project announce the use of term ( as oppose to just construction ) debt , even alongside institutional tax equity ( this combination of term debt and tax equity have heretofore be quite rare ) , and in some case , in quasi-merchant wind project . one such deal involve three project in new york state ( schedule for completion in @card@ ) , aggregate into a single debt facility by the project sponsor . other deal have feature increasingly aggressive term , with debt provider willing to extend maturity @card@ year or more into a project ' S " merchant tail " ( i.e. . , the period beyond which the project ' s power sale have be contract ) , and at least one deal feature a 20-year loan term ( include a 5-year merchant tail ) .

compare to the recent past , the growth in publicly own utility ownership in @card@ be striking . this growth be , arguably , inflate by the categorization of the 205-mw white creek wind project as a pou-owned project . although the four pous involve with the white creek project do not technically own any part of the project unless and until they exercise their purchase option ( after the project ' s tenth year ) , by pre-paying for a substantial portion of the project ' S power , these utility have nevertheless contribute roughly half of the capital require to build the project . this , plus the fact that the financing structure be specifically design to result in long-term pou ownership ( through the buyout option ) , favor the categorization of this project as pou-owned . power marketer be define here to include not only traditional marketer such as ppm energy , but also the wholesale power marketing affiliate of large investor-own utility ( e.g. . , ppl energy plus or firstenergy solution ) , which may buy wind power on behalf of their load-serving affiliate . hedge provider active in the market in @card@ include fortis , credit suisse , barclay ' S , j . aron & company , and coral energy holding ( a division of shell ) . these hedge be often structure as a " fixed-for-floating " power price swap - a purely financial arrangement whereby the wind project swap the " floating " revenue stream that it earn from spot power sale for a " fix " revenue stream base on an agreed-upon strike price . for at least one project in texas ( where natural gas be virtually always the marginal supply unit ) , the hedge have be structure in the natural gas market rather than the power market , in order to take advantage of the great liquidity and long term available in the forward gas market .

suppress by the receipt of any available state and federal incentive ( e.g. . , the ptc ) , as well as by the value that might be receive through the separate sale of renewable energy certificate ( see rec market remain fragmented and price volatile , page @card@ ) @card@ the price report here would therefore be high if wind project do not have access to these state and federal incentive and , as a result , these price do not represent wind energy generation cost .

market exist , where wind power may be able to compete with these spot price , and where additional revenue be possible from the sale of renewable energy certificate ( rec ) . another interesting development in @card@ be the initiation of cross-border sale of wind electricity into the unite state , despite the fact that those facility be not eligible for u.s. tax incentive . a portion of the west cape wind project , locate in price edward island ( new brunswick ) , begin export power and renewable energy certificate ( rec ) to new england in mid-2007 . later that year , hydro-quebec receive permission to sell into new england from two of its wind facility . finally , san diego gas & electric announce a 20-year contract with the propose 250-mw larumorosa wind project in Baja , Mexico .

upward pressure on wind power price continue in @card@
although the wind industry appear to be on solid footing , the weakness of the dollar , rise material cost , a concerted movement towards increase manufacturer profitability , and a shortage of component and turbine continue to put upward pressure on wind turbine cost , and therefore wind power price , in @ord@ Berkeley lab maintain a database of wind power sale price , which currently contain price datum for @card@ project install between @card@ and the end of @ord@ these wind project total @card@ , 303mw , or @card@ % of the wind capacity bring on line in the unite state over the @card@ period . the price in this database reflect the price of electricity as sell by the project owner , and might typically be consider busbar energy prices.22 the price be
@card@ @card@

base on this database , the capacity-weighted average power sale price from the sample of post-1997 wind project remain low by historical standard . figure @card@ show the cumulative capacityweighted average wind power price ( plus or minus one standard deviation around that price ) in each calendar year from @card@ through @ord@ base on the limited sample of seven project build in @card@ or @card@ and total @card@ mw , the weighted-average price of wind in @card@ be nearly $ @card@ / mwh ( express in @card@ dollar ) . by @card@ , in contrast , the cumulative sample of project build from @card@ through @card@ have grow to @card@ project total @card@ , @card@ mw , with an average price of just under $ @card@ / mwh ( with the one standard deviation range extend from $ @card@ / mwh to $ @card@ / mwh ) @card@ although figure @card@ do show a modest increase in the weightedaverage wind power price in @card@ and @card@ , reflect rise price from new project , the cumulative nature of the graphic mute the degree of increase . to well illustrate change in the price of power from newly build wind project , figure @card@ show average wind power sale price in @card@ , group by each project ' s initial commercial operation date ( cod ) @card@ although the limited project sample and the considerable variability in price across project install in a give time period complicate analysis of national price trend ( with average subject to regional and other factor ) , the general trend exhibit by the capacity-weighted-average price ( i.e. . , the blue column ) nevertheless suggest that , follow a general decline since @card@ , price bottom out for project build in @card@ and @card@ , and have since rise significantly.26 give the year-on-year increase in project-level install cost from @card@ to @card@ ( see a late section of this report ) , however , it come as some surprise that price from project install in @card@ be , on average , somewhat low than from project install in @card@ .

these price will typically include interconnection cost and , in some case , transmission expansion cost that be need to ensure delivery of the energy to the purchaser . for most of the wind power sale price report here , the wind generator be sell electricity and rec in a bundle fashion , and the price report here therefore reflect the delivery of that bundle product . for at least @card@ of the @card@ project in the sample , however , the wind project appear to receive additional revenue ( beyond the power price report ) from the separate sale of rec . the price provide in this report do not include this separate rec revenue stream , and therefore understate total sale revenue for these project . because a minority of project ( @card@ out of @card@ ) fall in this category , however , this factor be unlikely to significantly bias the overall result present in this report . all wind power pricing datum present in this report exclude the few project locate in Hawaii . such project be consider outlier in that they be significantly more expensive to build than project in the continental united state , and receive a power sale price that be significantly high than normal , in part because it be link to the price of oil . for example , the three major wind project locate in Hawaii ( total @card@ mw ) earn revenue in @card@ that range from $ @card@ / mwh to $ @card@ / mwh on average , which be considerably high than the price receive by most wind project build on the mainland . price from two individual project build during the @card@ period be not show in figure @card@ ( due to the scale of the y-axis ) , but be include in the capacity-weighted average for that period . the omit price be roughly $ @card@ / mwh and $ @card@ / mwh .

although it may seem counterintuitive , the weighted-average price in @card@ for project build in @card@ and @card@ ( show in figure @card@ to be about $ @card@ / mwh ) be significantly high than the weighted-average price in @card@ for project build in @card@ and @card@ ( show in figure @card@ to be $ @card@ / mwh ) for three reason : ( 1 ) the sample size be large in figure @card@ , due to the fact that @card@ price be present , rather than @card@ price as in figure @card@ ( i.e. . , we be unable to obtain early-year pricing for some of the project build in @card@ ) ; ( 2 ) two of the large project build in @card@ and @card@ ( for which both @card@ and @card@ price be available , mean that these project be represent within both figure ) have nominal ppa price that actually decline , rather than remain flat or escalate , over time ; and ( 3 ) inflate all price to constant @card@ dollar term impact old ( i.e. . , @card@ ) price more than it do more recent ( i.e. . , @card@ ) price . if the federal ptc be not available , wind power price for @card@ project would range from approximately $ @card@ / mwh to $ @card@ / mwh , with an average of roughly $ @card@ / mwh . it be also possible that region with high wholesale power price will , in general , yield high wind contract price due to arbitrage opportunity on the wholesale market . it may be surprising to some that relatively little pricing datum be available for texas , despite the enormous growth in wind capacity in that state . the reason be simple : because ercot be not electrically connect to the remainder of the u.s. grid , generator locate within ercot be not require to file pricing information with ferc . the pricing information for texas provide in this report come primarily from project locate in the texas panhandle , which be cover by the southwest power pool rather than ercot .

wind remain competitive in wholesale power market
a simple comparison of the wind price present in the previous section to recent wholesale power price throughout the unite state demonstrate that wind power price have be competitive with wholesale power market price over the past few year . figure @card@ show the range ( minimum and maximum ) of average annual wholesale power price for a flat block of power30 go back to @card@ at twenty-three different pricing node locate throughout the country ( refer to figure @card@ for the name and approximate location of the twenty-three pricing node represent by the blue-shaded area31 ) . the red dot show the cumulative capacity-weighted-average price receive by wind project in each year among those project in the sample with commercial operation date of @card@ through @card@ ( consistent with the datum first present in figure @card@ ) . at least on a cumulative basis within the

sample of project report here , average wind power price have consistently be at or below the low end of the wholesale power price range . though figure @card@ show that - on average - wind project install from @card@ through @card@ have , since @card@ at least , be price at or below the low end of the wholesale power price range on a nationwide basis , there be clearly regional difference in wholesale power price and in the average price of wind power . these variation be reflect in figure @card@ , which focus on @card@ wind and wholesale power price in the same region as show earlier , base on the entire sample of wind project install from @card@ through @card@ although there be quite a bit of variability within some region , in most region the average wind power price be below the range of average wholesale price in @card@ .

to try to control for the fact that wind power price have rise in recent year , figure @card@ focus just on those project in the sample that be build in @card@ and @card@ ( as oppose to @card@ through @card@ ) . at this level of granularity , sample size be clearly an @card@ wind project sample include issue in most region . @card@ project build from @card@ nevertheless , while there be @card@ great convergence between @card@ wind and wholesale price in @card@ this instance , power price @card@ from wind project build in @card@ nationwide wholesale power price range ( for a flat block of power ) @card@ and @card@ still appear , for cumulative capacity-weighted-average wind power price @card@ the most part , to be either @card@ within or below the range of @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@ wholesale power price . @card@ project @card@ project @card@ project @card@ project @card@ project rise wholesale power price @card@ , @card@ mw @card@ , @card@ mw @card@ , @card@ mw @card@ , @card@ mw @card@ , @card@ mw since early in the decade source : ferc @card@ and @card@ ` ` state of the market ' ' report , berkeley lab database , ventyx . have , to a degree , mitigate figure @ord@ average cumulative wind and wholesale power price over time the impact of rise wind power price on wind ' s @card@ competitive position .

project performance and capital cost drive wind power price
wind power sale price be affect by a number of factor , two of the most important of which be install project cost and project performance.33 figure @card@ and @card@ illustrate the importance of these two variable . figure @card@ show the relationship between project-level installed cost and power sale price in @card@ for a sample of more than @card@ , 200mw of wind project install in the unite state from @card@ through @card@ though the scatter be considerable , in general , project with high installed cost also have high wind power price . figure @card@ illustrate the relationship between project-level capacity factor in @card@ and power sale price in that same year for a sample of more than @card@ , @card@ mw of wind project install from @card@ through @ord@ the inverse relationship show that project with high capacity factor generally have low wind power price , though considerable scatter be again apparent . the next few section of this report explore trend in installed cost and project performance in more detail , as both factor can have significant effect on wind power price .

as show in figure @card@ , wind project install cost decline dramatically from the beginning of the industry in california in the 1980s to the early 2000s , fall by roughly $ @card@ , @card@ / kw over this period.35 more recently , however , cost have increase . among the sample of project build in @card@ , report installed cost range from $ @card@ , @card@ / kw to $ @card@ , @card@ / kw , with an average cost of $ @card@ , @card@ / kw . this average be up $ @card@ / kw ( @card@ % ) from the average cost of installed project in @card@ ( $ @card@ , @card@ / kw ) , and up roughly $ @card@ / kw ( @card@ % ) from the average cost of project install from @card@ through @ord@ project cost be clearly on the rise . moreover , there be reason to believe that recent increase in turbine cost do not fully work their way into installed project cost in @card@ , and therefore that even high installed cost be likely in the near future . the average cost estimate for @card@ , @card@ mw of propose project in the dataset ( not show in figure @card@ , but most of which be expect to be build in @card@ ) , for example , be $ @card@ , @card@ / kw , or $ @card@ / kw high than for project complete in @card@ .

project cost may be influence by a number of factor , include project size . focus only on those project complete in @card@ and @card@ ( to try to remove the confound effect of rise cost over the past few year ) , figure @card@ try to identify the existence of individual project cost ( @card@ online project total @card@ , @card@ mw ) project-level economy of scale . average project cost polynomial trend line there be clearly a wide spread in project-level cost among small wind project than among large project , but figure @card@ do not show strong evidence of economy of scale.36 give the wide spread in the datum , it be clear that other factor must play a major role in determine install project cost .

limited sample size early on - particularly in the 1980s - make it difficult to pin down this number with a high degree of confidence . this may simply be an artifact of the limited quantity and quality of available datum , and the influence of other confound factor . alternatively , it may be that economy of scale be evident in turbine transaction ( large turbine order yield low price ) , but those economy do not necessarily correspond with project size because a large turbine order could be use for either one large project or allocate among multiple small project .

project cost increase be a function of turbine price , and turbine price have increase dramatically
increase in wind power price and overall installed project cost mirror increase in the cost of wind turbine . Berkeley lab have gather datum on @card@ u.s. wind turbine transaction total @card@ , 600mw , include @card@ transaction sum to @card@ , @card@ mw in @card@ alone . figure @card@ depict these report wind turbine transaction price . source of transaction price datum vary , but most derive from press release and press report . wind turbine transaction differ in the service offer ( e.g. . , whether tower and installation be provide , the length of the service agreement , etc . ) and on the timing of future turbine delivery , drive some of the observed intrayear variability in transaction price . nonetheless , most of the transaction include in the Berkeley lab dataset likely include turbine , tower , erection , and limited warranty and service agreement ; unfortunately , because of data limitation , the precise content of many of the individual transaction be not know .

since hit a nadir of roughly $ @card@ / kw in the @card@ period , turbine price appear to have increase by approximately $ @card@ / kw ( @card@ % ) , on average . between @card@ and @card@ , capacity-weightedaverage turbine price increase by roughly $ @card@ / kw ( @card@ % ) , from $ @card@ , @card@ / kw to $ @card@ , @card@ / kw . recent increase in turbine price have likely be cause by several factor , include the decline value of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro , increase material and energy input price ( e.g. . , steel and oil ) , a general move by manufacturer to improve their profitability , shortage in certain turbine component , an up-scaling of turbine size ( and hub height ) , and improve sophistication of turbine design ( e.g. . , improve grid interaction ) . the shortage of turbine have also lead to a secondary market in turbine , through which price may be even high than those show in figure @ord@ though by no mean definitive , figure @card@ also suggest that large turbine order ( > @card@ mw ) may have generally yield somewhat low pricing than small order ( < @card@ mw ) at any give point in time . this be reflect in the fact that most of the large turbine order show in figure @card@ be locate below the polynomial trend line , while the majority of the small order be locate above that line .

@card@

graphical presentation of the datum in this way should be view with some caution , as numerous factor influence project cost ( e.g. . , whether project be repowered vs. " greenfield " development , etc . ) . as a result , actual cost difference among some region may be more ( or less ) significant than they appear in figure @ord@ see : replaced-dns / rising_utility_construction_ replaced-dns

figure @ord@ report u.s. wind turbine transaction price over time

( @card@ % of nationwide installed wind capacity at the end of @card@ ) @card@ though capacity factor be not an ideal metric of project performance due to variation in the design and rating of wind turbine , absent rotor diameter datum for each project , this report be unable to present the arguably more-relevant metric of electricity generation per square meter of sweep rotor area . both figure and the table summarize project-level capacity factor in the year @card@ , thereby limit the effect of inter-annual fluctuation in the nationwide wind resource.40

this trend of increase turbine price suggest that virtually the entire recent rise in installed project cost report earlier have come from turbine price increase ( recognize that these price reflect the cost of turbine , tower , and erection ) . in fact , because projectlevel installed cost have increase , on average , by roughly $ @card@ / kw during the last several year , while turbine price appear to have increase by $ @card@ / kw over the same time span , further increase in project cost should be expect in the near future as the increase in turbine price flow through to project cost .

figure @card@ show individual project as well as capacity-weighted average @card@ capacity factor break out by each project ' s commercial operation date . the capacity-weighted-average @card@ capacity factor in the Berkeley lab sample increase from @card@ % for wind project install before @card@ to roughly @card@ % @card@ % for project install from @card@ , and to roughly @card@ % @card@ % for project install in @card@ . @card@ in the good wind resource area , capacity factor in excess of @card@ % be increasingly common . of the @card@ project in the sample install prior to @card@ , for example , only @card@ ( @card@ % ) have capacity factor in excess of @card@ % in @card@ ( in capacity term , @card@ mw , or @card@ % , exceed @card@ % ) . of the @card@ project install from @card@ through @card@ , on the other hand , @card@ ( @card@ % ) achieve capacity factor in excess of @card@ % in @card@ ( in capacity term , @card@ mw , or @card@ % , exceed @card@ % ) . these increase in capacity factor over time suggest that improve turbine design , high hub height , and / or improve site be outweigh the otherwise-presumed trend towards

wind project performance have improve over time
though recent turbine and installed project cost increase have drive wind power price higher , improvement in wind project performance have mitigate these impact to some degree . in particular , capacity factor have @card@ % increase for project install @card@ % in recent year , drive by a combination of high hub @card@ % height , improve site , and technological advancement . @card@ % figure @card@ and @card@ , as well as table @card@ , present excerpt from a Berkeley lab compilation of wind project capacity-factor datum . the sample consist of @card@ project build between @card@ and @card@ , and total @card@ , @card@ mw

lower-value wind resource site as the good location be develop . further analysis would be need to determine the relative importance of the variable influence performance improvement . although the overall trend be towards high capacity factor , the project-level spread show in figure @card@ be enormous , with capacity factor range from @card@ % to @card@ % among project build in the same year , @ord@ some of this spread be attributable to regional variation in wind resource quality . figure @card@ show the regional variation in @card@ capacity factor , base on a sub-sample of wind project build from @card@ through @ord@ for this sample of project , capacity factor be the high in Hawaii ( though just two project ) and the heartland ( above @card@ % on average ) , and low in new england , the great lake , and the east ( below @card@ % on average ) . give the small sample size in some region , however , as well as the possibility that certain region may have experience a particularly good or bad wind resource year in @card@ , care should be take in extrapolate these result . though limited sample size be again a problem for many region , table @card@ illustrate trend in @card@ capacity factor for project with different commercial operation date , by region . in the heartland region , with the large sample of project in term of installed @card@

capacity , the average capacity factor of project install in @card@ ( @card@ % ) be approximately @card@ % great than that of the @card@ vintage project in the sample ( @card@ % ) .

operation and maintenance cost be affect by the age and size of the project , among other factor
operation and maintenance ( o & m ) cost be a significant component of the overall cost of wind project , but can vary widely among project . market datum on actual project-level o & m cost for wind plant be scarce . even where these datum be available , care must be take in extrapolate historical o & m cost give the dramatic change in wind turbine technology that have occur over the last two decade , not least of which have be the up-scaling of turbine size ( see figure @card@ , early ) . Berkeley lab have compile o & m cost datum for @card@ installed wind plant in the unite state , total @card@ , @card@ mw of capacity , with commercial operation date of @card@ through @ord@ these data cover

project with no @card@ o & m datum project with @card@ o & m datum

in the 2000s . this drop in o & m cost may be due to a combination of at least two factor : ( 1 ) o & m cost generally increase as turbine age , component failure become more common , and as manufacturer warranty expire44 ; and ( 2 ) project install more recently , with large turbine and more sophisticated design , may experience low overall o & m cost on a per-mwh basis . to help tease out the possible influence of these two factor , figure @card@ show annual o & m cost over time , base on the number of year since the last year of equipment installation . annual datum for project of similar vintage be average together , and datum for project under @card@ mw in size be exclude ( to help control for the confound influence of economy of scale ) . note that , for each group , the number of project use to compute the average annual value show in the figure be limit , and vary substantially ( from @card@ to @card@ data point per project-year for project install in @card@ through @card@ ; @card@ data point per project-year for project install in @card@ through @card@ ; and from @card@ to @card@ data point for project install in @card@ through @card@ ) . with this limitation in mind , the figure appear to show that project install in @card@ and later have have low o & m cost than those install from @card@ through @card@ , at least during the initial two year of operation . in addition , the datum for project install from @card@ through @card@ show a quite modest upward trend in project-level o & m cost after the third year of project operation , though the sample size after year four be quite limit . another variable that may impact o & m cost be project size . figure @card@ present average o & m cost for @card@ through @card@ ( as in figure @card@ ) relative to project size . though substantial spread in the data exist and the sample be too small for definite conclusion , project size do appear to have some impact on average o & m cost , with high cost typically experience by small project . more datum would be need to confirm this inference . though interesting , the trend note above be not necessarily useful predictor of long-term o & m cost for the late turbine model . the u.s. doe , in collaboration with the wind industry , be currently fund additional effort to well understand the driver for o & m cost and component failure , and to develop model to project future o & m cost and failure event .

@card@

some of the study include in the table also address capacity valuation for resource adequacy purpose ; those result be not present here . two major integration study for california be also complete in @card@ : one conduct by the california iso and another by the california energy commission ' s intermittency analysis project . neither of these study seek to comprehensively calculate integration cost , however , so neither be list in the table . wind penetration on a capacity basis ( define as nameplate wind capacity serve a region divide by that region ' s peak electricity demand ) be frequently use in integration study . for a give amount of wind capacity , penetration on a capacity basis be typically high than the comparable wind penetration in energy term . the relatively low cost estimate in the @card@ minnesota study , despite an aggressive level of wind penetration , be partly a result of rely on the overall Midwest independent system operator ( miso ) market to accommodate certain element of integrate wind into system operation . the low cost find in the @card@ california study arise because of the large electrical market in which wind power be integrate , as well as the relatively low penetration level analyze . conversely , the high integration cost find by avista and idaho power be , in part , cause by the relatively small market in which the wind be be absorb and , in part , by those utility ' operate practice ( specifically , that sub-hourly market be not use , as be common in isos and rtos ) . note also that the rigor with which the various study have be conduct have vary , as have the degree of peer review . even outside of isos and rtos , there be increase interest in collaborative system control action among balance area to address market operation inefficiency , include help to mitigate the impact of wind variability on system operation and cost . in the west , for example , the area control error ( ace ) diversity interchange project have seek to pilot the pool of individual ace to take advantage of control error diversity .

with the joint coordinate system plan ( whose participant include miso , spp , tva , and pjm ) , will examine a similar wind penetration in the combined footprint of these rtos and isos.49 finally , in @card@ , ercot will issue a study by ge on the potential impact of wind development on ercot ' s ancillary service requirement .

for inaccurate scheduling of wind generation , and interconnection queue procedure . a number of federal , state , and regional development occur in @card@ that may help ease the transmission barrier for wind over time . at the federal level , the u.s. doe issue its national electric transmission congestion report , which designate two constrained corridor : the southwest area national interest electric transmission corridor and the mid-atlantic area national interest electric transmission corridor . under the energy policy act of @card@ , ferc can approve propose new transmission facility in these corridor if state fail to do so within one year , among other condition . the u.s. doe ' S designation have prove controversial , however , and multiple effort to reverse these designation have occur or be underway . also at the federal level , in february @card@ , ferc issue order @card@ , which include several provision of importance to wind . first , the order adopt a cost-based energy imbalance policy that replace the penalty-based energy imbalance charge that apply under ferc order @card@ and that be much more punitive for wind . second , the order require transmission provider to participate in an open transmission plan process at the local and regional level . third , if transmission capacity be unavailable to service a firm point-to-point transmission application , then the transmission provider be require to examine redispatch and conditional firm service as alternative transmission service option . more recently , ferc have begin to investigate way to ease barrier impose by current interconnection queue procedure ; more activity on this topic be expect in @ord@ state and grid operator be also increasingly take more proactive step to encourage transmission investment , often

solution to transmission barrier begin to emerge , but constraint remain
after a prolonged period of relatively little transmission investment , expenditure on new transmission be on the rise . the Edison electric institute , for example , project that its member company will invest $ @card@ billion in transmission from @card@ , a @card@ % increase from the @card@ period . nonetheless , lack of transmission availability remain a primary barrier to wind development . new transmission facility be particularly important for wind power because wind project be constrain to area with adequate wind speed , which be often locate at a distance from load center . in addition , there be a mismatch between the short lead time need to develop a wind project and the lengthy time often need to develop new transmission line . moreover , the relatively low capacity factor of wind can lead to underutilization of new transmission line that be intend to only serve this resource . the allocation of cost for new transmission investment be also of critical importance for wind development , as be issue of transmission rate " pancaking " when power be wheel across multiple utility system , charge impose

@card@

within the context of grow renewable energy demand . several example of these initiative be present below : • texas : in October @card@ , the texas public utility commission ( puc ) issue an interim order designate five competitive renewable energy zone ( crez ) , define as area of high-quality renewable resource to which transmission could be build in advance of installed generation . these crezs could stimulate as much as @card@ , @card@ mw of new wind power capacity , and ercot have subsequently complete a transmission study for these area . • colorado : legislation enact in january @card@ require utility to submit biennial report designate energy resource zone ( erzs ) and to submit application for certificate of public convenience and necessity ( cpcn ) for these area . in October @card@ , xcel energy identify four potential erz area , create in large measure to support renewable energy development , and the colorado puc recently approve xcel ' s application for a 345-kv line in northeastern colorado.50 • california : in late @card@ , the california iso receive ferc approval for a new transmission interconnection category for locationconstrained resource , such as renewable energy facility . once a resource area have be identify , transmission would be build in advance of generation be develop , and cost would be initially recover through the california iso transmission charge . California also start the renewable energy transmission initiative to help define renewable energy zone in and around the state , and to prepare transmission plan for those zone . progress be also make in @card@ on a number of specific transmission project that be design to , in part , support wind power . in march @card@ , for example , the california puc approve the first three of ultimately @card@ segment of southern california Edison ' s tehachapi transmission project . fully develop , the project will transmit up to @card@ , @card@ mw of wind power . in minnesota , meanwhile , utility that be part of the capx @card@ statewide transmission planning group file application at the minnesota puc for four 345-kv line that will collectively increase transmission capacity in southwestern minnesota by @card@ mw , to about @card@ , @card@ mw total . finally , a number of state have create transmission infrastructure authority to support new transmission investment ; @card@ two of these state - colorado and new mexico - create transmission authority in @card@ in large measure to support renewable energy .

in @card@ ( adjust annually for inflation ) . the importance of the ptc to the u.s. wind industry be illustrate by the pronounced lull in wind capacity addition in the three year - @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ - in which the ptc lapse ( see figure @card@ ) . with the ptc currently ( as of early-may @card@ ) schedule to expire at the end of @card@ , the u.s. wind industry may experience another quiet year in @card@ absent an imminent extension . a number of other federal policy also support the wind industry . wind power property , for example , may be depreciate for tax purpose over an accelerate 5-year period , with bonus depreciation allow for certain project complete in @ord@ because tax-exempt entity be unable to take direct advantage of tax incentive , the energy policy act of @card@ create the clean renewable energy bond ( creb ) program , effectively offer interest-free debt to eligible renewable project ( though not without certain additional transaction cost ) @card@ finally , the usda provide grant to certain renewable energy application . state policy also continue to play a substantial role in direct the location and amount of wind development . from @card@ through @card@ , for example , more than @card@ % of the wind power capacity build in the u.s. be locate in state with rps policy ; in @card@ alone , this proportion be more than @card@ % . utility resource plan requirement in western and Midwestern state have also help spur wind addition in recent year , as have grow voluntary customer demand for " green " power , especially among commercial customer . state renewable energy fund provide support for wind project , as do a variety of state tax incentive . finally , concern about the possible impact of global climate change be fuel interest by state , region , and the federal government to implement carbon reduction policy , a trend that be likely to increasingly underpin wind power expansion in the year ahead . key policy development in @card@ include : • in february @card@ , the irs announce the distribution of roughly $ @card@ million in crebs , base on application receive in @card@ , include $ @card@ million for @card@ wind power project . • in September @card@ , a total of more than $ @card@ million in grant and loan award be announce under the usda ' S section @card@ grant program , include $ @card@ million for @card@ " large wind " project total @card@ mw in capacity . • illinois , new Hampshire , north carolina , and Oregon enact mandatory rps policy in @card@ , while ohio establish an rps in early @card@ , bring the total to @card@ state and washington d.c. ( see figure @card@ ) . a large number of additional state strengthen previously establish rps program in @card@ . • a variety of state and region continue to make progress in implement carbon reduction policy , and a rise number of electric utility consider the possible implementation of carbon regulation in their resource planning and selection process . • state renewable energy fund , state tax incentive , utility resource planning requirement , and green power market all help contribute to wind expansion in @card@ .

policy effort continue to affect the amount and location of wind development
a variety of policy driver have be important to the recent expansion of the wind power market in the unite state . most obviously , the continued availability of the federal ptc have sustain industry growth . first establish by the energy policy act of @card@ , the ptc provide a 10-year credit at a level that equal 2.0¢ / kwh

@card@ @card@ @card@

in @card@ , xcel energy reach a settlement with intervener to submit cpcn application for new transmission facility in all four erz area by march @ord@ these include colorado , Idaho , kansas , north dakota , new mexico , south dakota , and wyoming . such entity have also be eligible to receive the renewable energy production incentive ( repi ) , which offer a 10-year cash payment equal in face value to the ptc , but the need for annual appropriation and insufficient funding have limit the effectiveness of the repi .

come up in @card@
though transmission availability , site and permit conflict , and other barrier remain , @card@ be , by all account , expect to be another banner year for the u.s. wind industry . another year of capacity growth in excess of @card@ , @card@ mw appear to be in the offing , and past installation record may again fall . local manufacturing of turbine and component be also anticipate to continue to grow , as announce manufacturing facility come on line and existing facility reach capacity and expand . and all of this be likely to occur despite the fact that wind power pricing be project to continue its upwards climb in the near term , as increase in turbine price make their way through to wind

power purchaser . support continued market expansion , despite unfavorable wind pricing trend , be the rise cost of fossil generation , the mount possibility of carbon regulation , and the grow chorus of state interested in encourage wind power through policy measure . if the ptc be not extend , however , @card@ be likely to be a difficult year of industry retrenchment . the driver note above should be able to underpin some wind capacity addition even in the absence of the ptc , and some developer may continue to build under the assumption that the ptc will be extend and apply retroactively . nonetheless , most developer be expect to " wait it out , " re-starting construction activity only once the fate of the ptc be clear .

wind turbine mechanical vibration : potential environmental threat
author : w . dixie dean ( prof . em . ) bsc , miet , mba , bim , frsa Hon . lecturer , European centre for professional ethic

abstract this discussion paper describe a significant but overlook potential threat to the environment , community / business interest and land itself pose by wind turbine mechanical vibration . their power and frequency have be measure , and in ireland magnify similar vibration cause significant harm . give the nature of this problem the author be call on relevant authority to exercise increase caution when consider turbine installation until urgent threat assessment be complete .

1 .

problem outline

@card@ a Russian academic look at the use of wind power in the usa , canada and germany reporting " . . . wind turbine can cause infrasonic @card@ vibration which may damage flora and fauna at the site " . no detail be offer . @card@ apart from that paper impact of onshore wind turbine mechanical vibration on the natural environment have never be study , which be surprising since there be clear indication they may be harmful to life and the fundamental structure of peat and other terrain over considerable distance . only @card@ per cent of all paper on renewable energy publish in the past @card@ year consider environmental impact onshore2 and in the usa ( @card@ ) it be remark that " many of the suppose
independent scientist . . . give unbiased advice to the government to deal with the ( vibrations ) issue have receive substantial funding . . . from the major producer of @card@ noise pollution " . little have change since , and the uk be much the same . 2 . 2 .

@card@ these vibrations derive from complex interaction of mechanical factor associate with machinery include masthead electricity generator ; rotation bearing ; blade adjustment / brake mechanism ; effect of wind ; moment of force on mast / blade / tower , etc.4

@card@ due to complexity of design and functioning plus weather and other local environment variation over time , it may be impossible to predict these vibrations5 or their effect on the natural environment , add to the potential risk factor . @card@ many living specie be specialise , sensitive and vulnerable to small environmental change ; need large area with little background disturbance for relatively small but crucial population to survive ; and be variously affect by the vibration and acoustic noise wind farm create . all be fundamental to the universal food chain and turbine be often in site of special scientific interest where flora and fauna may be nationally and internationally protect .

evidence

@card@ hard evidence this may be a serious issue come not only from russia but from ireland , where in @card@ vibration cause by installation work result in half a million tonne of peat slip at derrybrien bury a home and road . sludge run off kill @card@ , @card@ fish , affect @card@ , @card@ more and cause other major problems.6 ecologist be currently consider if disappearance of wild trout stock from lough lee be related7 . @card@ concerned wind farm vibration might interfere with its work at eskedalemuir the ministry of defence commission a microseismic study from keele university which measure them.8 although this work be now to be extend natural environment impact remain exclude . the British energy technology support unit consider basic understanding be low , vibration be difficult to predict , and they may travel considerable distance . @card@ natural science academic confirm such vibration affect the structure of sand , soil and peat all of which will be compact , some lose fertility . they will impact flora and fauna include invertebrate , fungus , bio-aerosols see only under magnification , and individual live cell .

@card@ some indicative offshore installation study exist one of which speculate impact on live organism may be minimal but " . . . there ' s need to quantify by collect direct datum " , and suggest modulation mechanism " . . . be not fully understand " . it note many other uncertainty and gap in knowledge . a Danish paper suggest " . . .
short-term intense activity during construction be probably of less importance than operation and maintenance noise from the wind farm " .

@card@ wind farm be install on upland peat bog where visible damage may already be observe - for example paul ' S hill and thurso in scotland - with many more and large in planning on a variety of terrain . the bog may collapse as fibre unravel and flow away destroy the flora and fauna in them , adversely affect bird and mammal , and rot into sludge . subsequent foul run-off would pollute waterway with negative impact on fishing , farming , whisky , mineral / spring water bottling , landowner and other business interest . there would be increase risk of flooding ; loss of long enjoy local amenity ; and individual , business and taxpayer would be leave to clean up the mess . to date official body , wind farm manufacturer , owner , and installer have not agree to indemnify such injured party .

3 . @card@

specific information terrain : peat ; soil ; sand10-12

@card@ wind turbine impact all terrain landscape and functionality , but landscape be exclude from this paper . @card@ sand and soil be compact lead to reduce air and water permeation , with increase dryness . Canadian researcher find that for the first few minute high frequency vibration increase the fertility of soil ; but if vibration continue there ' s rapid decline . @card@ peat be an ancient , highly complex material , in many area a living environment . the macro- and microscopic structure of upland peat bog be comprise of minutely interlock vegetable fibre support dead and living organism , flora and fauna . this basic structure range from more or less decompose plant remain to a fine amorphic , colloidal mass . live peat be govern by complex hydrology which amongst other factor maintain stability and resistance to shear , slide and collapse .

@card@

invertebrates13 ; fungus @card@

several fungus specie depend on vibration at a specific time to release ripe propagation spore , notably homobasidiomycetes and lycogala . bioaerosols15

@card@

organic and inorganic particle in and above terrain surface range in size from less than one micrometer ( @card@ ' ' ) to one hundred micrometer ( @card@ ' ' ) . they react to air current , move quickly or slowly depend on the environment , and be impact by gravity . due to their size air density and current play a large role in movement . live cell @card@

@card@

it have be show that ultrasonic vibration deform and move isolated living cell , but we don ' t know what long term effect these phenomenon might have on their development .

conclusion i suggest these threat be sufficiently indicate to demand urgent attention . ignore them to meet Kyoto , e.u. . or other environmental target may be unwise , particularly when many question the de facto value of wind power to the environment on other ground . furthermore the u.k. be signatory to the kyoto protocol which require avoid damage to exist carbon sink , include peat bog . my concern may prove uncalled for but the " precautionary principle ' hold and in a responsible world we would expect an immediate moratorium on all new wind turbine installation until these matter be adequately examine and risk properly assess - but that may be indigestible .

in which case an alternative approach lie in that many turbine and wind farm be install on peat bog and other terrain about which a great deal be know from past ecological survey . a good start may be to repeat them urgently and establish if change be find , in what respect , to what degree , and if further research or other action be indicate . useful support vibration datum may be find in rail and road studies17 . in the meantime i call for significantly increase caution when consider major new turbine installation . this proposal have be put to natural england , Scottish natural heritage , Uk / Scottish government and other relevant authority as well as the British wind energy association of wind turbine manufacturer and key member . to date there have be no substantive response from any of those approach , which some may regard as play Russian roulette with the environment and life itself .

postcript i write as a mycologist recognise by the Scottish forestry commission but can not claim to be an authority on these matter . that say my view be academically support as show .

personal position statement
wind farm
i be not an environmentalist . i have no connection with any anti-wind farm lobby . my concern be express as a responsible citizen with lifelong love of nature , background mycologist . i be not academic in these matter other than to fully prove my concern be valid i first take interest in this matter last September , have since research the issue and now fully support my concern with appropriate peer review academic literature

risk i see may well prove negligible or acceptable , but right now we don ' t know and i think it imprudent to peremptorily dismiss them so in the public interest i ask three question of all responsible : can it be deny ; wind turbine mechanical vibration may seriously impact on sand , soil and peat compact , loosen and / or otherwise change their nature ; reduce fertility ; harm flora and fauna in them ? may collapse peat bog cause pollution significantly harm community and business interest ? if not ; who will enable research to assess such risk ? if no one ; who will indemnify public , private and community interest against loss , should they be harm as suggest ?

executive summary over the last two decade the demand for renewable energy have increase and in response the wind energy industry have grow by more than @card@ % annually . recently , offshore wind power have emerge as a ` ` new frontier ' ' in wind energy , with more than @card@ , @card@ megawatt of new generating capacity plan for the water off northern europe alone.1 by the end of @card@ , some projection suggest that the offshore renewable energy market may be worth as much as $ @card@ billion.2 however , economic benefit be not the only reason for develop an offshore wind farm . if a @card@ turbine wind farm with a maximum generation capacity of @card@ mw be construct off the coast of south carolina it could provide enough energy to power more than @card@ , @card@ homes.3 it would also prevent more than @card@ million ton of greenhouse gas from be release into the air each year by conventional coal fire plant . with the u.s. census bureau estimate that the combined population of fl , Ga , sc and nc will increase by over @card@ million by @card@ , off-shore wind energy can help south carolina and other southeastern coastal state meet a grow demand for electricity in a clean and sustainable way while provide significant economic development to both the coastal and inland region of the state . wind energy would allow for energy production for regional consumer without greenhouse gas emission or consumption of exhaustible energy source . base on this analysis , there would be a number of beneficial economic and fiscal impact to the state of south carolina result from the manufacture , installation and operation of a @card@ mw find farm ( @card@ four megawatt wind turbine generator ) off the coast of south carolina . manufacturing and installation impact over two-year period during the two-year construction phase the equivalent of up to @card@ , @card@ fulltime job will be create by direct , indirect and induce effect . annual state economic output be predict to increase by as much as $ @card@ million , and annual disposable income be expect to increase by up to $ @card@ million in the state . the fiscal effect result from the construction of an off-shore wind farm be predict to be an increase in state income tax revenue of up to $ @card@ million and an additional $ @card@ , @card@ in corporate income tax revenue over the two year period . operation phase impact during the operational phase of the project which begin in year three , predict economic and fiscal impact will result from the employment of worker to operate and maintain the power generation equipment , as well as from revenue generate by tourism of the off-shore wind farm . the analysis predict that employment will permanently increase by the equivalent of up to @card@ fulltime job over the currently predict baseline . annual state output be expect to increase by up to $ @card@ million and disposable income by up to $ @card@ million per year above baseline . predict fiscal impact be an increase in state personal income tax revenue of up to $ @card@ , @card@ and corporate income tax revenue of up to $ @card@ , @card@ in each year . in addition , state could potential provide a revenue neutral production tax credit of up to $ @card@ cent per mwh .

purpose of study wind be an inexhaustible source of power . it allow for the production of electricity without the use of expensive and environmental damaging fossil fuel . it generate electricity without the emission of greenhouse gas and it can create vast economic opportunity in not only local community but state wide as well . the purpose of this analysis be to estimate the economic and fiscal impact that would accrue to south carolina during the manufacturing and installation phase and the operational phase of a @card@ mw find farm ( @card@ four megawatt wind turbine generator ) off the coast of south carolina . the wind farm could be construct far enough off shore thereby prevent interference with coastal vista . the further away from land the wind farm be place , the good wind resource will be . south Carolina ' S off shore region carry the advantage of relatively shallow water for some distance from shore . accord to the university of delaware graduate college of marine study , mount for wind turbine can be construct in water as deep as @card@ to @card@ meter . chart indicate that water depth off of the south carolina coast be less than @card@ meter within twenty mile of shore.4 this provide ample space to take advantage of strong wind further off shore than would be available to many Atlantic coast state . employment develop south carolina ' s off-shore wind energy potential will create job in component manufacturing , turbine installation , facility operation and maintenance , and in a variety of other area which indirectly support these activity . manufacturing require skilled laborer who design and build the tower , rotor blade , generator , hub , substation interconnect , and assorted electronic control which make up a wind turbine power generating platform . installation typically involve local construction firm that will help boost local economy . the operation and maintenance need of a wind farm will create several permanent and high-quality local job . manufacture a majority of work involve in the construction of an off-shore wind farm go into manufacture the component , which include rotor blade , structural tower , hub , gearbox , generator , pylon and electronic control , of an off-shore wind turbine generator . at this time , most of the manufacturing of specialized component will happen out-of-state , at least in the near term . many of the world ' s major turbine manufacturer be base in europe , and the u.s.-based industry be mostly in california . however , general electric do have a presence within the state and be capable of develop and manufacture off-shore wind turbine generator . the construction of a large offshore wind farm off the coast of south carolina could help attract renewable energy manufacturer into the state . the creation of a southeast wind energy market could bring additional manufacturing capability to the state and to the southeast in general . for example , in montana some current contract for wind energy include offer to open wind-turbine manufacturing facility in the state.5 denmarkbased wind turbine manufacturer vesta consider establish its American headquarters just outside of boulder , Colorado . vesta originally cite Colorado ' s central location to the Midwest renewable

energy market as the major reason for consideration and encourage the state to further develop and market its renewable energy resources.6 accord to vesta , the facility would have employ at least @card@ worker ; however the firm eventually decide to locate its facility in portland , Oregon . although vesta official do not provide any justification for their decision , some possibility could be Portland ' s access to port facility , the economic incentive package offer by the city of portland , support by state and local official for the federal wind energy production tax credit , interest in wind development by local utility , and because several large wind energy project be currently be plan along the border between washington and oregon.7 in greenville , south carolina , general electric ' S plant have @card@ employee engage in the manufacturing of wind turbine generator . these job be create in @card@ after ge run out of space at its wind turbine plant in Pensacola , Florida . in @card@ , ge also shift its turbine business headquarters to greenville from schenectady , new york . since then it have add @card@ engineering job , bring the total design and testing work force to around @card@ , @card@ base on these fact , three model be create , each base on different assumption as to the amount of in-state manufacturing of the various component that make up a wind turbine generator . model i assume that @card@ % or $ @card@ million will be spend within the state to manufacture some component for the wind turbine . model ii assume that @card@ % or $ @card@ million will be spend in the state to manufacture several component of the wind turbine generator and that the assembly of the generator will occur within the state of south carolina . however , model iii assume that @card@ % or $ @card@ million will be spend within the state to manufacture and assemble the wind turbine generator . if south carolina and other southern state be to provide economic incentive in the form of tax credit and subsidy for renewable energy development , there be always the possibility that renewable energy manufacture would locate more of their facility in the southeast . installation it be estimate that an off-shore wind farm require up to @card@ worker on site during construction . these worker assemble turbine , erect tower , construct pylon , and lay cable . the estimated time for construction for this project be @card@ month . for land base wind farm , the electric power research institute estimate that every megawatt of wind energy capacity install create @card@ year-long local installation jobs.9 however , their estimate assume a @card@ month installation phase and it include worker use to construct road and other structure that would not be need for an off-shore wind farm . operation and maintenance off-shore wind farm require a well train staff to operate and routinely service the turbine throughout their 30-year lifetime . these need create long-term , full-time employment close to the port facility that would service the wind farm . the electric power research institute estimate that every @card@ mw of capacity require one full-time employee to operate , monitor , and service a land

base wind farm.10 since this analysis be base on a @card@ mw off-shore wind farm , use the estimate from the electric power research institute would equate to @card@ new job . the cape wind project be develop off of cape cod , massachusetts estimate that it would require @card@ fulltime employee to operate and maintain that off-shore wind farm.11 since there be some variation in the estimated number of employee require to operate and maintain the off-shore wind farm , we run three model with model i assume @card@ , model ii assume @card@ and model iii assume @card@ job for operation and maintenance . tourism the construction and operation of an off-shore wind farm will probably not increase overall tourism in the state , however individual tourist sector should benefit . several report have show that wind farm across the globe have receive significant interest from tourist . from manitoba , canada to palm spring , california , where @card@ , @card@ tourist visit each year , wind farm have see the number of visitor request tour climb . a study do by Mori find that nearly @card@ % of those visit argyil , scotland would be interested in visit the local wind farm if tour be offer . in denmark , one study find that tourism in area near wind farm have increase by @card@ % after completion of the projects.12 although much of the debate have focus on presumed negative impact of wind farm to tourism , there be evidence that positive impact to the tourist industry be possible . the model assume that after construction be complete @card@ , @card@ tourist would visit the off-shore wind farm annually . the cost of the tourist activity be limit to the expect increase in demand for sightseeing by way of motorize water transportation . all other impact to the coastal tourism industry would be negligible since we be assume that the primary reason for visit coastal south carolina would not be the off-shore wind farm . it be assume that the average cost of a sightseeing trip to the wind farm would be $ @card@ per visitor or $ @card@ , @card@ annually . indirect employment the economic impact of build power plant extend well beyond the direct job create in build and install the equipment . each dollar invest create impact that ripple outward throughout the local economy . for example , worker at a manufacturing plant need raw material and equipment . their work in assemble turbine support job in equipment manufacturing and component supply . contractor at a construction site need concrete and heavy equipment , and their work support additional job supply these need . in addition , all of these new worker require housing , food and other necessity that will be purchase locally . model in order to provide a more accurate picture of the potential impact of an off-shore wind farm to the state of south carolina , three model be develop . model i be develop to show the bottom range of the potential economic impact to the state . this model assume that a vast majority of the individual component that make up a wind turbine generator would be build outside of the unite state . model ii be develop to show the midrange economic impact to the state where

collaboration occur between an overseas manufacturer and a manufacturer locate within the state of south carolina . however , model iii be develop to show the potential economic impact when the wind turbine generator where entirely manufacture and assemble in the state of south carolina . another possible scenario be that since the state of south carolina only have control of the first three mile of ocean floor , it might be more feasible to build a shallow water wind farm use @card@ , @card@ megawatt wtg ' S rather than @card@ , @card@ megawatt wtg ' S . this would exempt developer from seek approval from federal agency . another benefit to a shallow wind farm would be that the general electric facility in greenville already produce @card@ megawatt turbine and would only have to expand and modify its production capacity rather than completely retool its facility or build a new one . since twice the number of @card@ megawatt wtg ' S would be require to produce a comparable amount of energy , model iii assume the same total cost of construction as the other model since per unit construction cost would be less in shallow water . the chart below show the input value use in the model .

a port in south carolina . base on other study , we estimate that @card@ maintenance team would operate on a daily basis , with each team comprise of @card@ maintenance personnel and @card@ crew member . with the other various operational job that would be require , there would be a total of @card@ full time employees.14 economic impact during manufacturing and installation the direct economic impact to the state of south carolina during the manufacturing and installation phase would consist of the hiring of worker and the purchase of non-labor good and service . at this point it be difficult to determine exactly how many of the specialized component of the wind turbine generator would be purchase outside of the state . other non-labor good and service such as concrete , steel , and marine service more then likely would be purchase within the state of south carolina . the temporary increase in economic activity within the state during the manufacturing and installation phase would be the sum of : • • • direct economic impact - hire of worker and purchase of non-labor good and service indirect effect - the additional demand for input from the industry that sell nonlabor good and service directly to the project induce effect - the increase in employment , income , and demand for other good and service that would be generate by the expenditure of disposable income of the newly hire worker

the size of the temporary increase in economic activity in the state during the manufacturing and installation phase and during the operation phase would depend upon the proportion of direct expenditure that take place within the state . once installation of the off-shore wind farm end and the operation phase begin , the associate direct , indirect and induce economic effect would be permanent change to the economy of south carolina . there will be two type of activity during the 24-month manufacture and installation phase : • manufacture of the blade and other wind turbine generator component in south carolina before be transport to the project site . study have show that a vast majority , nearly @card@ % , of the labor input require during the manufacturing and installation phase will be need for manufacturing of the wind turbine generator . installation of the wind turbine generator at the project site include the installation of the undersea monopile foundation that will support the wind turbine generator ; the onsite assembly of the wind turbine generator ; the construction of the electric service platform ; and installation of the offshore and onshore component of the transmission line that transport the electric power to the region ' S exist electric transmission and distribution system . about @card@ % of the labor input require during the manufacture and installation phase will be need for installation activity .

as the chart above demonstrate , in all three model the operation and tourism phase have a significantly large fiscal impact then the manufacturing and installation phase . only in model iii be the output during the manufacturing and installation phase great than the output from the operation and tourism phase of the project . give the estimated minimum that the state would receive in the form of state income tax and state sale tax revenue , spend at least $ @card@ million to encourage the development of an off-shore wind farm would not be unjustifiable . however , if the majority of the wind turbine generator be build within the state of south carolina , estimate suggest that state expenditure could increase to a minimum of $ @card@ million . base on this datum , the state of south carolina could offer a production tax credit of up to $ @card@ cent per mwh . however , revenue neutrality do not take into account the health and environmental benefit gain by the construction of an offshore wind farm , therefore a large production tax credit should be consider . the chart below show the total potential federal and state tax credit that could be offer to a developer to construct an offshore wind farm .

wind turbine and health

w

ind power have be gain prominence as a viable sustainable alternative to other form of energy production . study have find that there be increase population demand for " green ' energy1 , @card@ . in australia , this have be encourage by the introduction of the renewable energy ( electricity ) act in @card@ and the renewable energy target scheme in @ord@ as with any new technology , wind turbine be not without controversy . those who oppose the development of wind farm contend that wind turbine can adversely impact the health of individual live in close proximity .

do wind turbine impact on health ?
concern regard the adverse health impact of wind turbine focus on infrasound noise , electromagnetic interference , shadow flicker and blade glint produce by wind turbine . while a range of effect such as annoyance , anxiety , hearing loss , and interference with sleep , speech and learning have be report anecdotally , there be no publish scientific evidence to support adverse effect of wind turbine on health . report health concern primarily relate to infrasound ( sound that be generally inaudible to the human ear ) generate by wind turbine . the world health organization state that " there be no reliable evidence that sound below the hearing threshold produce physiological or psychological effect ' @card@ . a recent expert panel review in north america find no evidence that audible or subaudible sound emit by wind turbine have any direct adverse physiological effect4 . the principal human response to perceive infrasound be annoyance5 . a study of three uk wind farm also support this conclusion , find that sound associate with modern wind turbine be not a source which will result in noise level which may be injurious to the health of a wind farm neighbour6 . however , there be also the argument that if people be worry about their health they may become anxious , cause stress related illness which be genuine health effect arise from their worry , but not from the wind turbine itself . for this reason , nhmrc recommend that people who believe they be experience any health problem should consult their gp promptly . the situation be further complicate by finding that people who benefit economically from wind turbine be less likely to report annoyance , despite exposure to similar sound level as people who be not economically benefiting2 .

there be currently no publish scientific evidence to positively link wind turbine with adverse health effect .

how much sound do wind turbine produce ?
sound be compose of frequency express as hertz ( hz ) and pressure level express as decibel ( db ) . human sensitivity to sound be variable and people will exhibit variable level of tolerance to different frequency , include those below the normal range of human hearing7 . noise can be define as any undesirable or unwanted sound . the perception of the noise be influence by the attitude of the hearer towards the sound source7 . a recent study find that noise annoyance be strongly associate with a negative attitude to the visual impact of wind turbine on the landscape2 . table @card@ compare the noise produce by a ten turbine wind farm compare to noise level from some selected activity .

be there other feature of wind turbine that may have effect on health ?
it have be suggest that phenomenon such as shadow flicker and blade glint could have effect on health . shadow flicker describe the flick on and off of the wind turbine ' s shadow as the blade rotate1 . the primary concern with shadow flicker be the potential to cause epileptic seizure . the evidence on shadow flicker do not support a health concern1 . blade glint happen when the surface of wind turbine blade reflect the sun ' S light11 . all major wind turbine blade manufacturer coat their blade with a low reflectivity treatment which prevent reflective glint from the surface of the blade . the risk of blade glint from modern wind turbine be consider to be very low11 . there have be some concern about electromagnetic radiation from wind turbine however the closeness of the electrical cable counter the electromagnetic field , as do shield with metal armour12 . concern regard the adverse health impact of wind turbine focus on infrasound , electromagnetic radiation , shadow flicker and blade glint produce by wind turbine , as discuss above . while there be currently no evidence link these phenomenon with adverse health effect , the evidence be limit . therefore it be recommend that relevant authority take a precautionary approach and continue to monitor research outcome . comply with standard relate to wind turbine design , manufacture , and site evaluation will minimise any potential impact of wind turbine on surround areas13 .

base on these figure noise level from wind turbine have be assess as " negligible " , that be , they appear to be no different to that find in other everyday situations9 . further , a survey of all know published result of infrasound from wind turbine find that wind turbine of contemporary design , where rotor blade be in front of the tower , produce very low level of infrasound10 .

* the " a " represent a weighting of measure sound to mimic that discernable by the human ear , which do not perceive sound at low and high frequency to be as loud as mid range frequencies8 .

the whole goal of this project be to help farmer bob final report for eng r @card@ engineering design energy storage solution spring , @card@ morningside college haithem babiker samuel becker evan bowder brittany cole William foval elizabeth kelly Nathan mausbach Michael nicodemus dr. gary turner outline introduction to energy storage wind turbine research storage research flywheel water tower hydrogen storage decision need assessment seasonal demand analysis of excess / deficit production cost analysis wind turbine tower hydrogen system experiment conclusion section @card@ : introduction the whole goal of this project be to help farmer bob find a wind turbine , so that he can generate his own electricity . there be many different area of this problem that be cover . farmer bob need a certain wind turbine that would best suite his need . farmer bob also need a way of store enough energy to create at least two day worth of electricity . another thing that farmer bob want be to see if it be possible to run his car , truck , or other machinery use energy from the wind turbine . to start out research on what be need , the electrical use of average home in the area be need to see how much energy be go to be use in two day . one possibility that be look at be to either use a wind turbine that do not produce the need amount of electricity for every month , but do create excess electricity for a few month . another possibility be to just use a wind turbine that create excess electricity all year round through research on the Internet , it be find that for two day farmer bob would need @card@ kwh of electricity . to get @card@ kwh of electricity in two day , the storage device would need to be able to produce @card@ kw of electricity every hour . these be our only constraint . the idea the team come up with that would store enough energy for two day be a water tower , flywheel , battery , and hydrogen . while look at each one of these storage possibility there be factor such as cost , size , reliability , and safety that would aid in determine which storage device would be use by farmer bob . when look at the separate device that would store the energy need , there be seven area of importance that be look at while do research . each area be weight accord to importance so that when all seven of the area percentage be add up , they equal one-hundred percent . see table @card@ . @card@ @card@ table @card@ . @card@ @card@ design criterion for each major area of importance area of importance percentage initial construction cost : @card@ % reliability : @card@ % functionality : @card@ % maintenance cost : @card@ % ease of maintenance : @card@ % safety : @card@ % size : @card@ % we will go into the datum for each area of importance later in the main section of energy storage . battery battery be the first storage device think of , but the idea be quickly discard . battery would be much less efficient than any other storage idea . the battery would also have to be replace much more often . the initial price to purchase the battery wouldn ' t be quite as expensive as some of the other idea , but because they would need to be replace often the price would increase quickly , especially during the cold month . this be because battery tend to drain their energy much faster during the cold month . water tower through research and calculation many advantage of the water tower be find . one of the advantage be that the water tower would use ground water , which be a renewable source . since farmer bob life on a farm he most likely already have a well to get the water for his tower . another advantage be that once it be up and run it will be very safe and will need little maintenance . also , unless there be a major problem with the water tower , there will be a low maintenance cost . plus , since there be so many water tower all over the unite state , it would be easy to find someone to build it . there be also some disadvantage that come with use a water tower . the main problem with use a tower for create the energy for the two day be that it would be extremely expensive . they find that the water tower that would be use would cost nearly $ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ . another disadvantage be that it would be extraordinarily large . but , this be not too much of a problem because it will be locate on a farm , which have a large amount of space . a big disadvantage of use a tower be that it would have no functionality . the water tower couldn ' t help run a car or truck , the only thing it could do be produce electricity for the house . flywheel the team that do research on the flywheel decide to use steel to make it . this be because steel be fairly heavy , easy to find , and cheap to use . the reason the flywheel would need to be make of a heavy material like steel be to cut down on the overall size of it . the flywheel be a very simple design , so it wouldn ' t be that hard to find a company to build it . the flywheel , as long as enclose , would be quite safe because there aren ' t too many small hi-tech part to the flywheel , but the sheer weight of flywheel could cause it to be dangerous . depend on what break on it , the cost of maintenance could be very low , but if something such as the flywheel itself break than the cost of maintenance would be very expensive . also , there would be low maintenance because flywheel be typically long-life machine that don ' t break down easily . some disadvantage of use a flywheel be that it would have to be extremely large to produce the needed electricity . not only would it take up a large amount of space , but it would also be very heavy . this flywheel be use would have no functionality either . it would be too big to fit into a car or some other vehicle that farmer bob would have . depend on what break on it , the maintenance cost could be high . also , depend on what break , the flywheel weight would cause a big problem in the ease of maintenance . lastly the cost of the flywheel would be about the same as the water tower . hydrogen while do research on hydrogen many advantage be find . one of the advantage be the initial cost of get and set up the hydrogen machine because it would be cheap compare to the water tower and the flywheel . depend on the quality of the machine that farmer bob buy , the maintenance of the machine could be easy . this be because some machine tell you exactly what and where the problem be , the only thing be that a machine like this cost much more than the simple machine that don ' t tell you be all the problem be . the size of use hydrogen be a big advantage also . the machine that we would use be about the same size as regular household washing machine . as long as the hydrogen be in solid form , it would be pretty safe to use . also , hydrogen have a good functionality . it could be use to help run farmer bob ' S truck , car , or any other machine . although there be many advantage of hydrogen , there be also some disadvantage , but not many . the main disadvantage would be get the hydrogen . another problem that may occur , depend on what kind of hydrogen machine be use , be that find the problem , if one do occur , could prove to be difficult . if farmer bob buy a cheap machine he will have to have an expert come in and look at it , which will not be easy because there be not many expert on hydrogen in this region of the u.s. . when assign the percentage to each area of importance for the water tower , flywheel , and hydrogen there be big difference between the number . the flywheel receive @card@ point , the water tower receive @card@ point , and the hydrogen receive @card@ point . hydrogen be go to be use as our storage device due to the fact that it receive a great number of point . section @card@ : wind turbine research when we first get this problem there be only guarantee in it . that be that we have to use a wind turbine to harness the power of the wind . therefore , we need to become familiar with the system of the turbine . mean that we need to learn the different part of the wind turbine , and how they convert the wind into a form of energy capable of be store . we first start by look up the basic system of the wind turbine . this consist of the wind blow and then turn the blade of the wind turbine . the turning of the blade then create mechanical energy which can be store in various form . this be the basic to the system that we will be use . figure @card@ within this diagram you can see the many part to the wind turbine . the rotor blade be what turn from the force of the wind blow on them . these rotor blade then turn the gear within the gearbox . then the gearing of the system power a generator which be able to convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy and send it through to the grid connection . from the grid connection be where you would then pull your power from . within the rotor hub that the rotor blade be attach to there be mechanism that control the thing such as pitch and control the speed at which the blade spin . wind turbine tend to have brake in them that stop them from turn when wind speed get too high for the wind turbine to be able to stay together as it spin . within the hub be a pitch mechanism that control the angle at which the blade be tilt . next there be the yaw system which control the turning of the turbine to catch optimum wind for the most energy possible . by catch the optimum wind we will increase our chance of gain the most power possible through the generator and then store it in some sort of storage system . this system work to gather the most power capable of the wind turbine and generator . then this energy be store for usage in house and on equipment . this setup allow for the turbine to turn the with the wind and change orientation so that it be always capable of catch the wind at an optimum level . section @card@ : storage research after look into wind tower and turbine , research be do to find way to take and store its electricity . three main area be choose to be research further . these include how to store energy from the wind use kinetic energy , gravitational energy and chemical energy . three different group be form to research the solution and when find detail about each solution , the group present their result . the kinetic energy group decide on a solution that would involve a flywheel to store the energy . the gravitational energy group find a solution that involve the storage of energy use a water tower . finally , the chemical energy group decide to use hydrogen as storage for the energy make by the wind turbine . section @card@ : flywheel the next step of the process be to research whether kinetic energy could be store and whether it be a feasible solution to the problem . kinetic energy be the energy an object have due to its motion . after investigate the topic , several possibility for this type of energy storage be find . the most frequently mention solution be what be know as a flywheel . because this seem to have the most information about it , this be the option choose for the potential storage system . the flywheel have be around for a very long time ; they be especially popular before battery be generally use and be still use today . some place they can be find be in potter ' wheel , gear of clock , and in automobile . the flywheel be some type of wheel or disk attach to a shaft that be spin . as the shaft spin , the wheel spin as well , store kinetic energy over time . this store energy can then be transfer as kinetic energy still or convert into some other form of energy . in the problem at hand , the kinetic energy would be convert into electric energy and could then be use in the farmer ' S house and for his other figure @card@ : a flywheel in a race car . electric need . figure @card@ : nasa flywheel energy requirement after learn what a flywheel be and how it work , the next step be to design one for the problem . the first calculation need be how much energy the flywheel need to store . since wind be unpredictable , it be decide to look for a solution that would hold two day worth of energy . this number be figure by take an estimate a student ' S summer electric bill , which be around $ @card@ . this make the price of energy for two day to be around $ @card@ . after look at information from the Lincoln power company , the price per kilowatt-hour be say to be $ @card@ . with all of this information , it be determine that the flywheel have to hold joule of energy . design with this know , possibility for the actual flywheel could be determine . the factor that go into this next step be how big could the flywheel be , how fast could it safely spin , and what material could feasibly be use in term of cost and availability . it be decide that steel and aluminum would be the good choice for the project ; therefore , these be the two possibility research in more detail . several calculation be make to determine other factor of the flywheel . these include finding equation for the height and mass of the flywheel as well as other value need to find them . an in-depth list of equation be give in appendix a . two possible design be research . one be that of simply a solid disk attach to the shaft . the other be a cylinder with sixty percent of the middle hollow out . to attach this to the shaft , rod would have to be place in the middle . for the solution find , twelve such rod be use for stability and safety . for both possible design and both material , several combination of radius and angular velocity be put into the equation to determine the height . the radius test be between one and five meter . the velocity be between five and twenty-five meter per second . by put these value into a spreadsheet , the height for each combination could be find . also in this spreadsheet , the mass of each solution be find to see which combination be too heavy or too large to be conceivable , and therefore could not be use . from here , it be decide that the solid structure weigh too much and so the hollow out version be the one further pursue . figure @card@ : mass of different option also from this same spreadsheet , aluminum be drop as a possible material . since the material weigh less , the flywheel , which would already have to be very large when build with steel , would have to be even large . figure @card@ : height of flywheel with rod at @card@ rad / S . the y-axis be the natural log value of the height . the next stage be to determine which combination would be the good in term of a reasonable radius , height , and velocity . the combination that be pick as the well possible be that of a steel flywheel with a radius of @card@ meter , an angular velocity of @card@ radian per second , and a height of about @card@ meter . since the height be so much small than the radius , it be also determine that it would be good for the flywheel to have a vertical axis . legend for figure @card@ figure @card@ : compare natural log of height of the system for each angular velocity . figure @card@ : compare natural log of mass of the system for each angular velocity . after find price on the Internet for steel , the price for the flywheel be determine from the price find for bar-reinforcing steel . this price be $ @card@ per pound2 . the price of the flywheel alone come out to be $ @card@ , @card@ . installation and custom building be estimate to be this same price , make the total installed flywheel system $ @card@ million . advantage and disadvantage the advantage to use a flywheel be that it be quite easy to maintain . reliability be very high ; there be no intricate or very delicate part . along with this , a specialist be not really require if something go wrong . as long as the flywheel be enclose in some type of building , it can be consider very safe . however , this system have disadvantage as well . first of all , the sheer size of the flywheel make it difficult to do much with . whenever it might need to be lift , crane must be hire . next , there be the cost . since the cost be estimate at over $ @card@ million , it be unlikely that this would be the most cost effective system for the farmer . also , even though it would be quite easy to carry electric energy into the house , transfer it to car and truck with this system be virtually impossible . final decision the flywheel be then rate to see how well it score with the criterion . table @card@ below show the exact number with a @card@ through @card@ rating , with @card@ be the good . the flywheel disadvantage , functionality and size , score very low . as be show , reliability and safety be the advantage to use this system . the weight for each of the criterion be apply and the overall score find for the flywheel be @ord@ table 3 . 1 : score the flywheel criterion rating construction cost @card@ reliability @card@ functionality @card@ maintenance cost @card@ ease of maintenance @card@ safety @card@ size @card@ since this score be much low than that of the other two system , the flywheel be reject as a possibility for the farmer . this be mainly due to the size and cost of the system . since this solution be not choose as the good answer to the problem , research on this particular system stop and be then focus on the system that seem to provide the good solution . section @card@ : water tower S introduction to gravitational e nergy energy be everywhere . it be sometimes a challenge to find a way to store energy to be change later into electrical energy . one option be to store energy as gravitational potential energy . the first idea that come up with f igure @card@ . 2 . @card@ be to lift a lot of weight in the form of water high enough into the air use a water tower . gravitational e nergy what be use be the idea that if we use the formula for potential energy ( potential energy = mass x gravity x height ) to figure out how much water need to be how high . the energy work by lift a mass to a certain high enough to store enough energy to run a home for several day . when a mass fall the store energy or potential energy be change into kinetic energy . in order to produce a few hundred kilowatt of energy need the mass would have to be very large and very heavy . this would result in it be very difficult to lift as well as be fairly dangerous . we come up with the idea of use water . water be available , and easy to work with than a solid weight would be . figure @card@ force and w ater one of the first thing that we need to figure out be how much a gallon of water weigh . we find that one gallon of water = @card@ lbs . the amount of energy due to the force of gravity and mass be able to produce be what we will use to figure @card@ create the energy need . we use the amount of energy we need to produce a graph that show the size of water tower as well as the height difference between the water tower and the place that we collect the energy . in order to produce a tower that be large enough to collect the amount of energy need the tower would have to be rather large . the amount of force that be create by store water be increase the high up the water tower be . so the high the storage part of the tower be and the further down the water be release the more force it have . the force be what be use to turn generator the great the force the more energy be produce . it would work like a dam do . figure @card@ type of t owers there be several different type of water tower , a few of which be show in f igure @card@ . @card@ . some of these tower have the ability to hold the amount of water that we be go to need in order to store the amount of energy that be need to supply a farm for a short period of time . figure @card@ double ellipsoidal elevate toro sphere ped-cone fluted pillar / composite shape \ * mergeformat shape \ * mergeformat shape \ * mergeformat shape \ * mergeformat c ost of the water tower p roject the cost of the tower however would be rather large . depend on the size of the hill that that be use to our advantage around north west iowa the average hill be about @card@ foot the tower would still have to be about one million gallon . the cost of build a water tower depend on the size and location . there for unless we know what the site be like we can not have a reasonable estimate of how much it will cost . additional to the cost of the water tower be the cost of the pipe that have to carry the water from the tower to the area where we would gather the energy . a few example of the cost of build a water tower may give you an example of how much it would cost to build a water tower in the area . in odebolt iowa a water tower with a capacity of @card@ , @card@ gallon be build for a cost of $ @card@ , @card@ . in wisconsin rapids a @card@ million gallon water tower be build for $ @card@ million . so the size of water tower that we will need in order to store the amount of water need be go to cost a large amount . in conclusion , in order to store enough energy to sustain a farm in iowa for a short period of about two day be very difficult . it be possible ; however , the installation cost be not efficient . its maintenance be fairly easy . it ' S very safe to store energy in this manner . it ' S also a very reliable source of energy storage . not a very practical way to store energy . section @card@ : basic hydrogen fuel information hydrogen , unlike any other fuel , can be produce continuously from an unlimited source , water . it be the most common element in the universe . the production of hydrogen be simple and can also be produce use a variety of different fuel . through the electrolysis of water , hydrogen can be continuously produce as long as electricity be be supply for the electrolysis process . therefore the characteristic of have a continuous and unlimited supply of the hydrogen allow it to be a reliable source of fuel . hydrogen safety all fuel be combustible , include hydrogen . but certain characteristic of hydrogen allow it to have many advantage over fossil fuel in term of safety . be the light fuel , hydrogen ' s low density and ability to rapidly disperse allow it to escape into the air if a leak occur . in addition , hydrogen burn upward , produce only water and heat as a byproduct , and burn out fast in comparison to gasoline product . moreover , propane and gasoline have high density and slow dispersal rate that increase the risk of an explosion . hydrogen on the other hand have a low energy density , therefore produce less heat in a fire and pose less of an explosion risk . hydrogen level need to reach a concentration of @card@ % to @card@ % in the surround atmosphere in order to pose a danger . a concentration of gasoline only have to reach @card@ % before it be in danger of ignition . the chart below , table @card@ . @card@ , contain the characteristic of gasoline , methane , and hydrogen relate to ignition and explosion hazard . table @card@ characteristic relate to fire hazard of fuel *

global problem . university of Miami , coral gable , fl @card@ , usa hydrogen gas be also colorless , odorless , tasteless , and nevertheless highly flammable . a mixture of hydrogen with air burn with a pale blue almost invisible flame . these characteristic mark a hydrogen leak as relatively hard to detect . although hydrogen gas be non-toxic it may provoke suffocation by diminish the concentration of oxygen in the air below life sustain level . of course the hydrogen necessary for asphyxiation be well within the flammable range , therefore make fire the primary hazard . the storage of hydrogen can become dangerous . the good way to prevent danger pose by the storage of hydrogen include adequate ventilation , prevention of the formation of combustible fuel ( oxidant mixture ) , and remove potential source of ignition . availability the hydrogen market be rapidly expand . the advantage of be portable , reliable and available in unlimited amount have arouse much research and interest . there be several company that produce hydrogen system product such as storage device , electrolyzers , and fuel cell . hydrogen system be become even more common today . the company sigen have recently announce a $ @card@ , @card@ contract for the installation of @card@ wind turbine , electrolyzer , hydrogen storage facility , and a 5kw fuel cell system at a park in scotland . in addition , much research be still be do to make hydrogen solution more feasible and cost effective . the hydrogen system the hydrogen system specific to this project take into account three main component : the electrolyzer , storage tank , and the fuel cell . this report concentrate on these three main component . albeit the main component constitute the bulk of the cost , various purifier , regulator , converter , and special connection be require to make the system work . for calculation and conversion regard hydrogen , refer to appendix b . in diagram , figure @card@ . @card@ , the wide spectrum of usage for hydrogen the hydrogen system can be see . figure @card@ * picture take from ovonics electrolyzer an electrolyzer be a device that use a method of electrolysis to convert water ( or other hydrogen contain fuel ) into gaseous hydrogen . there be several way to generate hydrogen , a few of these include hydrocarbon conversion , ammonia dissociation , methanol reform , and sponge iron-oxidation . however , these technique give an emission of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide , while water electrolysis produce only hydrogen and oxygen as an output . the production of hydrogen have always be common and electrolyzers have a broad range of use . such application for an electrolyzer include : provide o2 for life support ; provide h2 for corrosion control , electric generator cooling and electronic and material processing , gas chromatograph detector , metal form , and weld . there be two main type of electrolyzers : the potassium hydroxide ( koh ) electrolyzer , and the proton exchange membrane ( pem ) electrolyzer . the pem electrolyzer be choose for this project due to its ability to generate pure hydrogen from water at pressure around @card@ psig or high , therefore eliminate a need for a compressor . the pem electrolyzer be an important component of the hydrogen system . when connect to a water supply and an electrical output it can generate hydrogen gas at a constant pressure . theoretically , electrolyzers split water into hydrogen gas at an electric potential of @card@ volt . water enter the electrolyzer through a connection port . the hydrogen ion then gather towards the negatively charge cathode while the oxygen molecule gather at the positively charge anode . the hydrogen gas be then transport out of the electrolyzer , while oxygen be emit into the air . the electrolyzer can be connect directly to a fuel cell to generate electricity , but it be typically connect to a hydrogen storage device . the hydrogen storage device receive the hydrogen output from the electrolyzer and store the hydrogen gas as a metal hydride , liquid , or gas . figure @card@ h2o ( h2 + o2 + heat * picture take from greenwinds , replaced-dns / greenwinds / replaced-dns a typical electrolyzer have @card@ % efficiency . moreover , commercial electrolyzers can output hydrogen gas at a pressure of @card@ to @card@ psig . the range of pressure output be also increase ; high pressure electrolyzers of @card@ to @card@ psig be become available in the market . hydrogen storage hydrogen can be store in a variety of way , each of which caries its own specific advantage and disadvantage . hydrogen be relatively non-corrosive , therefore the cost of specially design material be reduce . but embrittlement may occur in some metal at elevated temperature and pressure . below be the different type of hydrogen storage method that be consider for this project . liquid hydrogen hydrogen be available in a liquid state , but only at extremely cold temperature . because of the cold temperature equipment must be specially design . liquid hydrogen typically have to be store at @card@ kelvin or -253o c . the cool and compress process also require energy , result in a loss of about @card@ % of the energy that the liquid hydrogen be store . after hydrogen be produce , the gaseous hydrogen be then compress , cool to low cryogenic temperature by the use of heat exchanger and tube expander . liquid hydrogen be normally store in onsite storage system typically consist of a tank , vaporizer , and control . these system be select in accordance to usage rate , pressure , and regulation . the tank be cylindrical in shape and usually place in a horizontal position . liquid hydrogen tank be vacuum insulate , with pressure relief valve locate on both end in order to protect the tank . liquid hydrogen tank capacity can range from @card@ gallon to @card@ , @card@ gallon there be safety concern involve with the liquid storage of hydrogen and the maintenance of the cryogenic tank . moreover , the ease of use be diminish whilst use liquid hydrogen . extreme care be take when deal with the liquid , protective clothing be always wear in order to prevent exposure to the extremely cold liquid and hydrogen vapor . the major disadvantage of liquid hydrogen be cost , and ease of usage . it be rather expensive to manufacture insulate cryogenic tank for the storage of hydrogen . detail of the expense and specification concern the vessel specific to the project be locate in section @card@ . figure @card@ * picture take from a Stanford webpage , sts-93 shuttle launch , http : / / replaced-dns / ~ stanj / travel / sts-93 / gaseous hydrogen gaseous hydrogen can be store in several different way . it may be compress into gas cylinder by oil lubricate compressor , store into tube trailer , or store as a highly compress gas in storage tank . cylinder the cylinder be usually taper to a small opening on the top where a valve or any other suitable outlet connection be locate . the cylinder be usually fill in with hydrogen pressure range from @card@ psig to @card@ psig . the amount of gas in the cylinder be determine by the pressure , temperature , cylinder size , and cylinder pressure rating . cylinder have the advantage of be mobile , but a major disadvantage be that cylinder of more than @card@ scf be quite rare . detail of the expense and specification concern the cylinder specific to the project be locate in section @card@ . tube trailer stationary tube or hydril tube module store large quantity of hydrogen . these tube be usually taper on both end to which connector valve , or safety device can be attach . they be commonly mount on a truck trailer chassis . the tube capacity can reach up to @card@ , @card@ scf , with an average pressure of @card@ , @card@ psig . hydrogen tube trailer be usually a good choice when mobility and immense hydrogen quantity be the major deciding factor . since this be not the case regard the current project , hydrogen tube trailer be not recommend as a medium of storage . compressed tank hydrogen can be compress into high-pressure tank . this process require energy to accomplish and the space that the compressed gas occupy be usually very large . a hydrogen gas tank would be more than @card@ , @card@ time big than the gasoline tank for the same amount of energy store . compress the gas be also expensive and must be periodically test and inspect to ensure safety . these disadvantage prove compressed hydrogen tank as a poor option for this project . detail of the expense and specification concern the tank specific to the project be locate in section @card@ . metal hydride tank metal hydride be make of combination of metallic alloy that act like a sponge soak up water . the metal hydride can absorb hydrogen and release it later , either at room temperature or through the heating of the tank . one disadvantage be that the ratio of percentage of gas absorb to volume of the metal be rather low , but hydride offer a valuable solution to hydrogen storage . metal hydride offer the advantage of safely deliver hydrogen at a constant pressure . yet a major disadvantage of metal hydride include high cost . detail of the expense and specification concern the vessel specific to the project be locate in section @card@ . carbon n anotubes carbon nanotubes be microscopic tube of carbon that store hydrogen in microscopic pore on the tube and within the tube structure . they be similar to metal hydride for store and release hydrogen , but the main advantage of carbon nanotubes be the amount of hydrogen they be able to store . although this seem like a good option for the project it be not consider any further because carbon nanotubes be still in the research and development stage . figure @card@ ( a ) hydrogen tube trailer , ( b ) hydrogen gaseous cylinder , and ( c ) compress hydrogen storage * picture take from ovonics fuel cell a fuel cell be an electrochemical device that be capable of deliver electrical energy continuously by a reaction of a fuel and an oxidant gas at an efficiency range of @card@ % @card@ % . a fuel cell resemble a battery , but unlike a battery it do not need continuous replacement or recharg . a fuel cell will continuously produce electricity and heat as long as it be supply with hydrogen gas . the fuel cell consist of an electrolyte in between two electrode , call the anode and the cathode . hydrogen from the storage unit and oxygen from the air be pump into the fuel cell . activate by a catalyst , the hydrogen gather to the anode , while the oxygen ion gather towards cathode . the hydrogen atom separate into proton and electron . the electron pass through an electric circuit create a flow of electricity . the proton , however , migrate to the cathode through a membrane to reunite with the oxygen molecule to produce water and heat . figure @card@ * picture take from the nasa electrochemistry website , http : / / replaced-dns / www / electrochemistry / doc / replaced-dns there be four primary fuel cell technology consider for this project : - table

lanthanum magnate cathode and a nickel-zirconia anode electrolyte silicon carbide matrix polymeric membrane thin layer of zirconium oxide as a solid ceramic electrolyte potassium hydroxide advantage most commercially develop fuel cel l . operate at relatively low temperature and can vary its output to meet shift power demand . excellent for small application . promise for high power application , electrical generate station r egenerative or reversible fuel cel l can produce electricity from oxygen and hydrogen , but can also be reverse to work as an electrolyzer . the pem ( proton exchange membrane ) fuel cell be choose for this project since it can operate at relatively low temperature of 80˚c allow it to warm up quickly and not need expensive containment structure . furthermore only relatively low temperature fuel cell be attractive for the pem electrolyzer . the pem fuel cell be also more versatile in relation to output . for a give volume or weight , the pem generate the most power of any fuel cell . the pem can also be connect to a hydrogen storage tank that store solid , gaseous , or liquid hydrogen . all these advantage make the pem fuel cell the optimal choice . r ating the hydrogen storage system be rate for each criterion on a scale of zero to ten with ten be the great , see figure @card@ . these rating be then use to compare the hydrogen system to other

matrix show above , table @card@ . @card@ , provide a fair comparison of all the alternative create by the team . the first two column list the criterion and their particular weight in percent . go across the matrix and evaluate each alternative against a single criterion give the rating score . multiply that score with the weight give for each specific criterion obtain each point value , which be then total after all criterion be evaluate . the solution with the high point value , in this case the hydrogen system , be consider the good solution for store energy . when look into each criterion it be easy to see why the hydrogen system be choose as the well possible solution . overall cost for each solution be very high , but when compare to the other alternative the hydrogen system come out to be the most inexpensive option . the safety of all three solution be rate similarly because each option be equally as feasible in this criterion . the section that have the big impact when it come to the point value be the functionality criterion . the functionality criterion be base on how each solution could use the energy that be be store . the group want to look into the possibility of use the wind turbine and energy storage for not only power the house with electricity but for other option such as power the car and farm equipment . the flywheel and water tower be very limit in their capability of transport the energy from one thing to another . their main purpose be just to store the energy , therefore give their functionality a low score . the hydrogen system be however adequate in meet all the demand . it could store the energy for late use , transport it to the house for power , and with the technology available it could also be use to power the car , laptop , and even a cell phone . with all these capability the hydrogen system be give a ten for functionality as compare to the alternative solution which both receive a two . when evaluate size , the hydrogen system provide a more feasible solution than the alternative . with the constraint give for the amount of energy that need to be store both the water tower and the flywheel would have to be an overpowering size . when look into the size of a hydrogen storage system , with the same constraint apply , the estimated size would be that of a household washing machine , thus make the hydrogen system a far good option in the size criterion than the flywheel and the water tower . overall , when analyze the point value of all three of the solution , the hydrogen system score the great value . when look closer at each criterion it be easy to understand how the hydrogen system be more proficient in not only store the energy need , but also be able to be transport and use for multiple purpose . with more capability for use than those of the flywheel and water tower the decision be make to go with a hydrogen storage system to be use with the wind turbine and tower . section

monthly production compare to monthly demand since all of the system produce more than be demand during the year , the next step be to determine whether it would be cheap to build a big wind turbine and tower that produce more energy and require less storage , or to have a small turbine system which require a much large storage system . in order to determine the well possible solution , cost of various turbine , tower , and hydrogen storage system must be research . figure @card@ below demonstrate how each system ' S production compare to the other system ' and also the actual and average demand . figure @card@ : compare system section @card@ : cost analysis section @card@ : cost of turbine within the cost analysis of the wind turbine we have come up with five different combination of height of wind turbine , size of the turbine , and number of turbine . the price for everything that we would need for the different turbine combination have be research . recommendation for optimal configuration be base on this datum and the amount of storage . the @card@ combination be : table @card@ combination company turbine size ( # of turbine ) tower height ( ft. ) a whisper @card@ kw ( @card@ ) @card@ b whisper @card@ kw ( @card@ ) @card@ c whisper @card@ kw ( @card@ ) @card@ d jacobs @card@ kw ( @card@ ) @card@ e excel @card@ kw ( @card@ ) @card@ combination a : through our research we find that we would need two of them raise to a height of @card@ foot when on their tower . these turbine cost $ @card@ , @card@ each . this make our pricing for this combination to $ @card@ , @card@ without the tower cost . we be not able to find the cost of a @card@ foot tower . we do find the pricing of @card@ foot tower which be which be $ @card@ , @card@ . through simple figure it be easy to see that a @card@ foot tower would have to cost more than a @card@ foot tower for the shear fact that the tower be tall . in this scenario we will need to be able to store @card@ or more kilowatt hour as to make up for the month that we can not produce enough power from our turbine . combination b : in the second combination we have a @card@ kilowatt turbine produce by whisper mount on a @card@ foot tower . we will use two of this combination . the turbine cost $ @card@ , @card@ each which bring the turbine total to $ @card@ , @card@ . then the tower will cost $ @card@ , @card@ , therefore , the full cost of the tower will be $ @card@ , @card@ . this bring the full cost for this scenario to $ @card@ , @card@ . with this scenario we will need to store at least @card@ kilowatt hour . combination c : for our third scenario we will need to store @card@ kilowatt hour for the month we be not able to produce enough energy . we will be use the same @card@ kilowatt turbine as in scenario two . in this scenario we will use three turbine put on @card@ foot tower . the total cost of the three turbine come to $ @card@ , @card@ . in our research we be able to find @card@ foot tower cost $ @card@ each . therefore , the total cost of the tower be $ @card@ , @card@ . the total cost of this whole scenario come to $ @card@ , @card@ . combinations d & e : in fourth scenario we will be use one jacob ' S @card@ kilowatt turbine set on a tower that be @card@ foot tall . the @card@ foot tower pricing come out to $ @card@ , @card@ . we be not able to find any price on the jacob ' S @card@ kilowatt turbine . in this scenario we would need to be able to store at least @card@ kilowatt hour of energy . if we estimate that this turbine must cost similar to the excel @card@ kw turbine then the price would be around $ @card@ , @card@ . with that estimation the total would be around $ @card@ , @card@ . in the final scenario we will be use an excel @card@ kilowatt turbine place on top of a @card@ foot tower . the excel turbine cost $ @card@ , @card@ . the tower that we will be use will cost $ @card@ , @card@ . this will bring the total for this scenario to $ @card@ , @card@ . in this scenario there will have to be storage for @card@ kilowatt hour of energy . figure @card@ while look over all the scenario it be understandable that you need to take in to account the amount of maintenance that will be do on the turbine . most of the time more turbine would equal more maintenance , but because the one turbine option be large turbine there be a possibility that they would need more maintenance . therefore , the scenario that have two or three turbine could have high maintenance cost than those with only one turbine , but that be not necessarily true just more likely . at the same time those with more turbine continually need less store energy . therefore , there would be less storage cost when more than one turbine be use . though , the maintenance cost could be slightly high in the third scenario ; the low amount of storage need the amount spend on storage material would be considerably low . for that reason we feel that scenario three be the most viable one for our need . therefore , we will be recommend three @card@ kilowatt turbine on @card@ foot tower to produce the energy need to run our farm . figure @card@ section @card@ : cost of wind tower introduction to wind tower wind tower be an easy way to increase the amount of energy produce by a wind generator . in figure @card@ you can see that as height above the ground increase so do the wind speed . the wind tower also allow the farmer to keep the wind generator danger a safe distance away . height and wind energy wind energy increase also depend on the location of the wind turbine and tower . when the wind tower be in a place that be flat there be an increase in energy . also as illustrate in figure @card@ . @card@ you can see that when there be tall object obstruct the wind the wind speed decrease . so the ideal place for a wind turbine to be place be in the middle of a field fill with a short crop . this placement will give the user easy access to a slightly high speed wind source . different type of wind tower one of the big difference in wind tower be the many option . an interesting fact about tower be that there be several different type . the different type of tower be illustrate in figure @card@ . the guy tower be a tower that have wire help to support the structure . a lattice tower be a tower that use angle iron and different geometrical shape to produce a stable tower that support its self and the wind turbine . there be pole tower lattice tower guy tower some tower that be just a pole stick out of the ground ; however , these structure be very weak and unreliable . there be also the possibility of a tower that can tilt up or down there be several method to achieve this goal as see in figure @card@ . one of the final choice that farmer bob have in choose a wind tower be the possibility of attach it to an already stand building . this give additional height . the drawback to this could be the stability of the building , the location of the building , and the availability of a building large and strong enough to support a wind tower and turbine . tilt up tower cost the most likely decide factor when it come to our tower be the cost . most wind turbine will fit the different type of tower with little or no modification . therefore , the type of tower be not a determine factor in the cost of the wind turbine tower . the wind tower cost vary with height and brand , the brand of wind turbine be the most important factor in purchase a wind tower . this be show in f igure @card@ . the cost accord to height be not the determine factor it be the type of tower that be most likely to be the decide factor . whisper ( guy tower ) bergey ( tilt up ) Bergey ( lattice tower ) @card@ @card@ @card@ @card@

capital cost of storage per kwh price may vary by company and model , the price list above be estimate price quote receive for this project . after do a cost analysis of the hydrogen system for each alternative form of storage it be decide to go with a gas storage tank . this decision be make on the basis of cost mainly with safety , size , and efficiency also be consider . in term of safety the metal hydride be the safe of the three solution with gas and liquid hydrogen be equally rate for safety . these three solution be almost equivalent in size for store . for more information about size , safety , and efficiency please refer back to the hydrogen system section of the report . for each solution a fuel cell and an electrolyzer be need , use the model list above the cost of the system would be $ @card@ , @card@ plus the cost of the storage . when use a gas storage tank with the fuel cell and electrolyzer a total cost of $ @card@ , @card@ be estimate for @card@ , @card@ liter store . this price estimate be far less than those of the metal hydride or liquid hydrogen storage option , make gas storage the well possible solution . section @card@ : electrolysis experiment use a small electrolyzer we compose a series of experiment in order to test various aspect of the electrolyzer by vary salt content and voltage . the first set of trial consist of an electrolyzer connect to a voltmeter and an ac generator . by vary the salt content of the electrolyte in the electrolyzer and keep the voltage close to constant , we observe the output of hydrogen with each addition of salt content . figure @card@ illustrate the change efficiency of the electrolyzer as the salt content change . from this graph we find that the efficiency of the electrolyzer rise as the salt content rise , but the efficiency start to decrease after a certain maximum point of salt content efficiency . figure @card@ the next set of trial be conduct by vary the voltage , and measure the hydrogen output . from the result , it be conclude that small voltage produce the great efficiency for the electrolyzer . figure @card@ illustrate the efficiency with vary voltage , while figure @card@ show the hydrogen output with vary voltage . figure @card@ figure @card@ it be observe that the efficiency of the electrolyzer be also low . this be especially clear once the efficiency of the fuel cell be measure and find to be much high than that of the electrolyzer . the efficiency of the demonstration fuel cell be find to be at @card@ % , which be much high than the @card@ % note from the demonstration electrolyzer . section @card@ : conclusion it be feasible for farmer bob to have a wind turbine to generate all his electricity . he have the opportunity to use any wind turbine , but he need a wind turbine that will produce enough electricity for all his use every month ; also , he do not need a wind turbine that will generate way too much electricity . it be find that farmer bob would good be suit with one of the five turbine option that be state in section @card@ . farmer bob would get great efficiency out of the wind turbine if he place it on top of a hill . farmer bob need a way to save the energy create by the wind turbine for day when there be little or no wind . battery , a water tower , and a flywheel be all idea that be not go to be use because they all have too many disadvantage compare to a hydrogen system . see S ection @card@ . a hydrogen system be the most feasible system for farmer bob to store the energy that the wind turbine generate . hydrogen cylinder be also the good type of hydrogen save system that farmer bob could use . compare to the cost , hydrogen cylinder be the safe and most reliable . see page @card@ . when it come to farmer bob ' S car or truck , he will not feasibly be able to run the vehicle on the energy the wind turbine generate . the use of hydrogen be how the energy be go to be save . hydrogen have already be prove to power vehicle engine , but at a high cost . for farmer bob the cost of convert his vehicle engine to run on a hydrogen fuel source wouldn ' t be too expensive , but get the extra hydrogen to fuel his engine would be expensive . plus , hydrogen power vehicle do not have the same output as normal gasoline engine . therefore , it would end up cost farmer bob more to run his car on hydrogen than it would to run his car and truck on the current fuel source of gasoline . appendix a variable : k = kinetic energy d = density i = moment of inertia m = mass v = volume r = radius h = height l = length

a study of a wind farm power system

national wind technology center national renewable energy laboratory golden , colorado abstract a wind power system differ from a conventional power system . in a conventional power plant , the operator can control the plant ' S output . the output of a wind farm can not be control because the output fluctuate with the wind . in this study , we investigate only the fixed-frequency induction generator , often use with wind turbine . we adopt the worst-case scenario and conduct a per-phase , per-turbine analysis . our analysis show a strong interaction among the wind farm , the utility grid , and the individual generator . in this paper , we investigate the power-system interaction result from power variation at wind farm use steady-state analysis . we use the characteristic of a real windsite on a know weak grid . we present different type of capacitor compensation and use phasor diagram to illustrate the characteristic of these compensation . the purpose of our study be to provide wind farm developer with some insight on wind farm power system . key word : wind turbine , power system , wind farm , renewable energy , stability , voltage fluctuation , capacitor compensation , induction generator , reactive power compensation . introduction in the early stage of wind energy development , the number of turbine be small and the location of the farm be scatter . thus the contribution of power from wind farm to the grid be negligible . as the size of a wind farm get large , the contribution of the power from the farm get large , and the interaction between wind farm and grid become more important to the operator and utility company . many wind turbine use fixed-frequency induction generator . the induction generator be connect directly to the utility line . the power system ' S problem relate to fixed-frequency wind turbine be more challenging to engineer than the variable-speed wind turbine , because there be minimum control that can be apply to fixed-frequency induction generator . figure @card@ show a cluster of wind turbine connect to a grid . the single-line diagram represent the system be show on the same figure . the wind turbine be operate use a constant-frequency induction generator . each generator be connect to a distribution transformer at the foundation of the wind turbine . the output from each wind turbine be connect to interconnection point to be call the point of common coupling ( pcc ) . from the pcc , the output be connect to a transmission transformer , raise to a high voltage , and transmit over the transmission line . at the end of transmission line , it be connect to the rest of a much large grid ( infinite bus ) . the impedance of the transformer and transmission line be lump together and be represent as zs . while conventional power plant use synchronous generator , a wind farm power plant use induction generator as the main generation . the behavior of the synchronous generator be very well know and have be investigate for more than a hundred year . similarly , the behavior of the induction motor be widely know . although considerable effort have be spend on develop induction motor , induction generator be not commonly use in conventional power plant . in this study , we use the characteristic of the power system for a real wind farm connect to a know weak grid . the line between the wind farm and the infinite bus may have several connection to feed small town or load along the way . we investigate how the voltage behave at these connection when the wind speed a very large grid

change . the voltage variation at the pcc not only affect customer connect to the same point ( town a and town b ) , but also affect the entire wind farm . another important aspect of the investigation be the stability of the power system at the wind farm . it be show in the next few section that a strong correlation exist between the voltage variation and the stability of the system . instability can cause the whole wind farm to shut down . many publication have discuss hybrid power system with diesel generator operate in parallel with wind turbine , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ however , wind farm power system be consider less problematic than hybrid system . unfortunately , not all wind farm be connect to a stiff grid . many area with excellent wind resource be locate in weak grid system . also , many wind farm increase their output by install big and new wind turbine . while a dynamic simulation be an important tool in determine the stability of the wind farm power system , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ the big picture of a wind farm operation can be well understand from the basic characteristic of each component . steady-state analysis be use to explain the behavior of a wind farm power system because it give a broad spectrum in understand the system interaction . in the section that follow , we first describe the component of a wind farm power system , include the wind turbine , induction generator , and parallel representation of wind turbine . next , we discuss the perphase , per-turbine equivalent circuit represent the entire power system , and then present different type of compensation . finally we summarize the paper in the conclusion section . component of a wind farm power system wind turbine the simple aerodynamic model commonly use to represent the turbine be base on power performance versus tip-speed ratio ( cp-tsr ) . the cp-tsr characteristic of the turbine be derive from measured average output power and average wind speed . the aerodynamic power generate by the wind turbine be determine by the density of air , the radius of the blade , the performance coefficient at any instant , and the wind speed . figure @card@ show curve of aerodynamic power output for wind turbine at different rotor speed . it be assume that the wind turbine be stall-control operate at a constant frequency . the rotor speed show on the legend be the rotor rpm at the high-speed shaft ( at the generator side ) . as can be expect , the peak of available aerodynamic power increase as the rotor rpm be

figure @ord@ aerodynamic power versus wind speed for different rotor rpm ( stall control ) fix at high speed . thus , operation at high slip increase the aerodynamic power capability of the wind turbine . once a runaway occur for a stall-controlled wind turbine , the generator can not regain control of the wind turbine . some type of brake mechanism must be available to control the rotor speed . induction generator figure @card@ show a typical power-speed characteristic of an induction machine as the operate slip vary from slip = @card@ ( motor ) to slip = - @card@ ( generating ) . assume there be no loss in the induction generator , the power show in figure @card@ be the power that must be drive by the wind turbine . normal ( stable ) operating slip usually lie within a very narrow slip range ( around + @card@ % , bound between pm-peak and pg-peak in figure @card@ ) . the normal motor region lie between @card@ % and @card@ % of synchronous speed , while the normal generat600

ing region lie between synchronous speed and about @card@ % of synchronous speed . rate power be usually about @card@ % of peak power ( pg-peak ) . the relationship between voltage and current of an induction machine vary as the slip change from standstill to generating speed ( above synchronous speed ) . at large slip , the stator current be much large than in normal operate slip . as an example , at startup ( slip = @card@ ) , the stator current can reach up to @card@ % of the rate current . the magnitude and the phase angle of the stator current affect the voltage drop along the transmission line . parallel representation of wind turbine as show in figure @card@ , a wind farm can be simplify as n parallel turbine . the follow assumption be make to simplify the analysis : • • • the wind turbine be identical . wind speed at the wind farm be uniform , so that all wind turbine start at the same time . each turbine run at the same operate condition at all time ; thus , the voltage , current , and power factor of each turbine be identical to the rest .

and the final solution be simplify as : vs = es - zsnew i1 [ @card@ ] where : zsnew = n zs . conduct our analysis on a per-turbine , per-phase basis enable us to understand the collective effect of wind turbine power generation in a wind farm environment . as show by the equation above and in figure @card@ , the number of turbine will change the characteristic of individual induction generator when the size of line impedance zsnew grow large as we add more turbine into the wind farm . for newly construct wind farm , the grid system be usually compute for possible expansion in the future . in many place , however , a wind farm be connect to an existing grid . although the transmission system in this grid be thermally capable of carry the generate power , the system grid may be weak ( zs be large ) . per-phase , per-turbine analysis figure @card@ show the per-phase , per-turbine equivalent circuit of an induction machine in a wind farm connect to the utility grid via a transmission line . the utility be represent by the infinite bus es , and the reactance zs represent line impedance and transformer impedance present between the induction machine and the infinite bus . the number of wind turbine on-line determine the loading of the transmission system . thus , it affect the voltage at the pcc . the characteristic of each induction generator connect to the same pcc will be affect . the number of wind turbine will appear as if the impedance zs be multiply by n , where n be the number of turbine operate at the same time . thus , the more turbine be on-line , the weak the grid appear to be ( large zsnew ) . figure @card@ illustrate the loading effect on a certain transmission line . the impact of vary the slip of the induction generator and the impact of add more turbine to the same line be show . the normalize voltage at pcc for different number of turbine on-line also be show . with only @card@ wind turbine , it be obvious that the power system grid be stiff and the voltage do not change with slip . in the normal speed range beutility

the impedance of the line feeder between each turbine and the pcc be identical and negligible . in practice , wind farm can be very large , and the location of individual wind turbine can vary , as do the wind speed at each wind turbine . the operate condition of wind turbine can also be different with respect to each other . thus , the assumption above may lead to a pessimistic result or the worst-case scenario . equation @card@ through @card@ be derive base on the sign and arrow convention of the voltage and current show in figure @ord@ the variable print in bold be phasors , and each equation can be express or illustrate by a phasor diagram . with only a single turbine operate , the terminal voltage at the pcc of the wind farm can be express as : vs = es - zs i1 [ @card@ ] if there be n identical turbine operate in parallel , the voltage equation can be express as : vs = es - zs ( i1 + i2 + i3 + i4 + i5 + . . . + in ) [ @card@ ] with the assumption present above , the current in each branch be equal . i1 = i2 = i3 = i4 = i5 = . . . . . = in [ @card@ ] the equation can be rewrite as : vs = es - zs ( n i1 ) [ @card@ ] or , if analyze on a per-turbine basis , the equation become : vs = es - ( zs n ) i1 [ @card@ ]

figure @ord@ peak electromagnetic torque and aerodynamic torque comparison be increase to @ord@ thus , there be a good chance that the aerodynamic power of the wind turbine will overpower the induction generator and the wind turbine will go into a runaway condition if nothing be do to control it . at the same time , the winding of the generator will be overheat and the voltage will collapse due to operation in a high-slip region . this be illustrate in figure @card@ , two-dimensional graph use to describe a three-dimensional problem . the vertical axis be use to represent the torque ( electromagnetic torque and aerodynamic torque ) . the righthand side of graph be use to represent the aerodynamic peak torque versus wind speed . it be show that aerodynamic torque vary with the wind speed ; it reach its peak at @card@ m / S . the left-hand side of the graph be use to represent the electromagnetic torque of the generator versus the wind speed for two different number of wind turbine on-line . it also show that the peak of electromagnetic torque of the induction generator ( the left-hand-side curve ) shrink as the number of turbine on-line be increase . by compare the left-hand-side and the right-hand-side , it be show that the electromagnetic peak torque drop below the peak of the aerodynamic torque when the number of turbine on-line be above @ord@ this be the operate point where instability occur , thus the wind turbine be in a runaway condition . the slip at maximum electromagnetic torque be show to be about @card@ % . the corresponding voltage at this point of instability can be refer to figure @card@ , where it be show that for @card@ turbine online , at @card@ % slip ( slip at peak torque ) , the voltage drop as much as @card@ % to @card@ per unit . thus in a way , the voltage drop indicate how close the operation of a wind turbine to the run-away condition . if the wind turbine low voltage limit be set to @card@ % or high , the runaway condition will not happen , because the wind turbine be take off line before runaway condition occur .

conclusion in this paper , we assume the worst-case scenario for a wind farm , i.e. . , each wind turbine operate at exactly the same operate point throughout the entire farm . in reality , the wind farm usually cover a large area and the wind speed within the farm be not uniform . thus the actual situation be usually good than the worst-case scenario . base on a per-turbine analysis , we show the follow : - under per-phase , per-turbine condition , have n turbine on-line have the same effect as have one turbine connect to an infinite bus via n zs line impedance . - as the number of turbine online increase , the available voltage at the point of common coupling be low , and the torque-speed characteristic of the induction generator shrink . - we compare voltage profile at pcc , and the torque characteristic and the stator current at each turbine for different type of compensation . - when the number of turbine on-line increase , the available voltage at pcc drop ( due to high loading of the transmission system ) and the torque-speed characteristic of the generator shrink . as the margin of instability decrease , at one point , the wind turbine aerodynamic torque can overpower the generator torque and the operate slip increase further . at high slip operation , the aerodynamic torque available increase . if no outside intervention ( pitch control or mechanical brake ) be take , a runaway condition can occur . - capacitor compensation can help to boost the voltage at the pcc , thus improve the torque-speed capability of an individual induction generator .

ideal parallel compensation require a variable reactive power as the output power and power factor fluctuate . a static var compensator can be use to provide parallel compensation with fluctuate reactive power need . series compensation can be use to offset the voltage drop across line impedance X . the size of the capacitance can be compute give the required compensation . tscs can be consider to provide an adjustable series capacitor compensation . a combination of parallel and series compensation can be use to improve the overall system . with the correct choice of capacitor size , fix capacitor can be use for both series and parallel compensation . we recommend that , during the wind farm design process , the characteristic of the induction generator be consider . the future expansion of the wind farm should also be take into account .

small-scale wind turbine for sustainable energy supply in urban environment
frank scheurich university of glasgow email : f.scheurich @ replaced-dns introduction the world ' s current mean for the production of useful energy be largely unsustainable . the deployment of coal- and gas-fired power plant be associate with the emission of significant quantity of the greenhouse gas carbon-dioxide ( co2 ) . today ' S electricity be mainly generate by centralise power station that require electricity to be transfer , often over a long distance , from the power plant to the end-user . the method of centralise power production with its associated long-distance energy transmission be inefficient and cumbersome . high efficiency be achieve by the concept of decentralise energy supply in which the urban energy requirement be locally provide by on-site energy production equipment . decentralise power generation base on renewable resource will be one of the most important step towards the drastic reduction in carbon emission within city ( the stationery office , @card@ ) . amongst the renewable energy system that have be consider to address the compatibility of decentralise electricity generation and sustainability , mertens ( @card@ ) and stankovic , et al . ( @card@ ) , among other , have identify small-scale wind turbine to be device with high potential for efficient application in the urban environment . in this paper , result from a computational study be present that show which characteristic in the aerodynamic design of an urban wind turbine be crucial in order to enable an operation of the turbine with minimum noise and minimum vibration - key requirement for the application of wind turbine in the urban environment . wind turbine in urban wind condition wind turbine can be categorise accord to the orientation of the axis of rotation with respect to the wind direction . figure @card@ show a schematic representation of a vertical-axis wind turbine in comparison to a horizontal-axis wind turbine . in contrast to current on- and offshore wind farm where mostly large-scale horizontal-axis wind turbine be deploy , one of the strategy of harvest wind energy in the urban environment be base on small-scale vertical-axis wind turbine with rotor diameter of only several metre . the application of vertical-axis wind turbine in city be mainly due to their inherent advantage over horizontal-axis wind turbine in the build environment since vertical-axis wind turbine be , by design , insensitive to the wind direction . horizontal-axis wind turbine , in contrast , have to be rotate into the wind each time the wind direction change .

the aerodynamics of the urban environment be characterise by frequent change in wind direction and high turbulence generate by the presence of building . although vertical-axis wind turbine be suit to implementation in urban wind condition , there be still challenge in the aerodynamic design of the turbine that have to be address . these challenge include the design of a wind turbine that have maximum aerodynamic efficiency in highly turbulent wind and , at the same time , have minimum environmental impact in term of noise and vibration . in addition , strategy and technology have to be develop further to ensure energy supply in the absence of wind . figure @card@ show a state-of-the-art vertical-axis wind turbine and a current example of its integration into the urban architecture .

research method in the field of aerodynamics there be two main method employ by academia and industry in the field of wind turbine aerodynamics : either the wind turbine be study experimentally in a wind tunnel , or the turbine be investigate computationally use method that belong to the field of so-called computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) . the motion of any fluid can be describe by the navier-stokes equation that be derive from the basic physical principle of mass , momentum and energy interchange . in cfd , these equation be solve numerically in order to simulate the aerodynamics of wind turbine . further information about cfd be give by anderson ( @card@ ) , for example . the result from both experimental and computational research contribute to a good understanding of the flow physics and enable the performance of individual turbine configuration to be investigate in detail - a necessity in order to adapt the design of wind turbine to the unique aerodynamic condition in the urban environment . computational study of the aerodynamics of vertical-axis wind turbine the aerodynamic performance of two vertical-axis wind turbine have be simulate use a computational fluid dynamics method that be call the vorticity transport model ( vtm ) , develop by brown ( @card@ ) . one of the two vertical-axis wind turbine that be investigate possess straight blade , as show in figure @card@ , whereas the other vertical-axis wind turbine comprise blade that be helically twist around the rotational axis , as depict in figure @ord@ the concept of modern vertical-axis wind turbine be patent in the unite state by georges darrieus ( @card@ ) . the patent include turbine configuration with untwisted rotor blade . further research in the last decade have show , however , that helical blade twist have structural and aerodynamic benefit . vertical-axis wind turbine with untwisted blade suffer from oscillation in the aerodynamic loading that result in vibration and can cause material fatigue . in order to overcome this disadvantage , the blade be twist helically around the axis of the rotor . indeed , scheurich , et al . ( @card@ ) confirm in a comparative study that the variation in overall loading on a vertical-axis wind turbine with helically twist blade be significantly small when compare to a vertical-axis wind turbine with untwisted blade .

in the field of wind turbine aerodynamics , the torque coefficient , cq , which be a non-dimensional parameter , be use in order to compare the performance of turbine configuration that differ in design and size . figure @card@ show the numerically-predicted variation of the torque coefficient , within one turbine revolution , for both wind turbine that be investigate . the torque that be output by the wind turbine that comprise helically twisted blade be relatively steady , whereas the torque produce by the wind turbine with straight blade oscillate significantly within one revolution of the turbine . the oscillate torque that be produce by the wind turbine with straight blade , result in significant vibration that be introduce into the tower and foundation of the turbine . in contrast , helical blade twist considerably reduce the oscillation in torque . the variation of the torque coefficient of the turbine with helically twist blade be , however , not entirely smooth due to the mutual aerodynamic interference between the blade of the rotor . figure @card@ , take from scheurich , et al . ( @card@ ) , show the complex wake structure that be produce by the wind turbine with helically twisted blade . downstream of the turbine , each blade encounter its own wake , develop in one of the previous revolution of the turbine , and the wake produce by the other blade . these interaction result in the small fluctuation that be observe in the variation of the torque coefficient , as describe above . the computational method that be use to simulate the aerodynamics of an urban wind turbine enable the cyclic loading on the blade of the turbine , and consequently the vibration induce by the turbine to be quantify in detail . base on these result , a follow-up study will be carry out in order to investigate the parameter of blade aerodynamics that be most relevant to achieve a design with maximum efficiency and minimum vibration . conclusion urban wind turbine will contribute significantly to a sustainable energy supply in our city of the future . wind turbine with vertical axe have be identify to be superior to wind turbine with horizontal axe in the unique urban wind condition that be characterise by wind of high turbulence and frequent change of wind direction . in this paper , some result from a computational study have be present that indicate that a vertical-axis wind turbine with helically twist blade can significantly reduce the environmental impact through noise and vibration when compare to a vertical-axis wind turbine with untwisted blade . high aerodynamic efficiency in urban wind condition but , at the same time , minimal impact through noise and vibration be important characteristic of a wind turbine that be to be integrate in the urban environment . reference

' as part of our cooperative ' s renewable energy program , this new wind farm exemplify dairyland ' s active commitment to that standard . " this late project will add to dairyland ' s existing wind power portfolio , which include partnership for energy output of a wind turbine farm in chandler , minn. " dairyland work hard to be ahead of the curve with the amount and variety of renewable energy provide to our member , " say dairyland director of planning service neil kennebeck . " as planner , it have be a very exciting year as we continue to bring more of the good " green ' energy option into our generation mix . this wind farm be locate in one of the windy part of minnesota , promise a good supply of renewable power for our member . in fact , it be so windy , we actually have trouble erect the wind turbine during construction . " in addition to the wind farm , dairyland have recently contract for several other renewable energy project - fuel by dairy and swine manure and landfill waste - as part of its proactive approach to provide clean , efficient electricity to its member . g . mcneilus wind farm-adams fact : dairyland power cooperative will purchase the energy output of five turbine on the adams wind farm from g . mcneilus wind energy , dodge center , minn. each wind turbine will produce @card@ megawatt ( mw ) of electricity for a total of @card@ mw . @card@ , @card@ residential home can be power by this renewable energy . each turbine weigh approximately @card@ , @card@ ton . the three blade on the turbine each weigh @card@ , @card@ lbs . , and be each @card@ foot long . the circle create by the three blade be nearly as wide as a football field . the turbine tower be @card@ foot tall . the turbine blade and tower be make in north dakota . the generator be make in denmark . [ sidebar ] wind power : the pro and con although wind energy be the most well-known source of renewable power , the fact regard wind as a fuel source be frequently not well understand . because wind , as a renewable form of energy , generate emissions-free electricity , the question be ask : why can ' t all our power come from wind ? simply put , wind be an inconsistent fuel source ... and reliability be everything when it come to your energy need . as electric consumer , we count on the light come on when we flick the switch . we count on our computer to operate when we want to send an e-mail . we count on our furnace to heat our home when we be cold and our air conditioning to cool us down when we be hot . even in the windy region , the wind do not always blow . during the heat of the summer , when utility ' power supply be seriously tax by the use of air conditioning , what energy source be the most likely to fail ? wind . the dog day of summer be not associate with steady wind . mother nature be one element human being can not control . we can not will the wind to blow anymore than we can wish away the rain on our wedding day . provide electricity require a near-perfect balance of supply and demand . although a valuable part of a utility ' s fuel supply , wind have trouble with both end of the supply and demand equation . " wind turbine be able to run approximately @card@ percent of the time over a year . at time , way too much wind will be produce and at time , too little or none at all . this be wind ' s fundamental problem , " say dairyland director of planning service neil kennebeck . since electricity can not be store , other generation resource must instantly back down or ramp up to accommodate the situation . compare that to other renewable energy source , such as dairy and swine manure or landfill waste . these be reliable , round-the-clock source of fuel for electric generator . cow and pig manure be abundant in our region ; therefore , concern about an undependable fuel supply be not relevant to that fuel source . and , despite effort to expand recycling program , the human population will always generate landfill waste . both landfill and animal waste can be convert to methane gas for use as a non-stop fuel source . that be good for anyone who use electricity ... which be nearly everyone . in sum , wind energy be an important part of dairyland ' s power supply . however , it can not be the only source . coal , natural gas and other type of renewables also must be include to maintain a well-rounded , reliable supply of electricity . dairyland power cooperative , la crosse , wisconsin , provide the wholesale electrical requirement and other service for hawkeye rec and @card@ other electric distribution cooperative and @card@ municipal utility . these cooperative and municipal , in turn , supply the energy need of more than half a million people . dairyland ' s service area encompass @card@ county in five state ( Wisconsin , Minnesota , Iowa , illinois and michigan ) .

" we be all gratify that this business arrangement will benefit these child , who currently be in dire circumstance . it be my mission to see that this renewable energy program will also give a renewed chance for a good life for the child , who have be truly on their own in every sense , " say Garwin mcneilus . for more information contact : tom miller or cindy christensen ( @card@ ) @card@

site since @ord@ the current wind farm be construct as an alternative to pmld purchasing power from Seabrook nuclear power plant . the resident of the town of Princeton vote in favor of purchase and develop this @card@ acre site as the town ' s wind farm in january @ord@ the existing wind farm consist of ; seven @card@ kw enertech and one Atlantic orient corporation @card@ kw turbine mount on @card@ ' steel lattice tower . currently five of the turbine be not operational due to lightning damage and age . all of the unit be at the end of their useful life and the cost to maintain and repair the exist unit be not practical . the small amount of electricity they produce do not justify the high maintenance and repair cost . our current strategy be to run the operational unit to failure . the original plan as design in @card@ recommend approximately @card@ kw of capacity on @card@ meter ( @card@ foot ) tower . pmld do not install the recommended size and quantity of unit due to the high cost , and therefore , only @card@ kw of capacity be install on much small tower . this decision result in less energy generate than the project @card@ % of the town ' S requirement . the wind resource at this low height and the @card@ ' mature tree canopy surround our site be also factor contribute to low than expect amount of renewable energy for our existing site . the new state-of-the-art turbine we propose to install be base on entirely new wind speed analysis conduct over the past three year . new wind speed datum be collect from eight new anemometer mount at various height on our site . the propose tower size be significantly tall than the mature tree canopy surround our site . this will result in generate significantly more renewable energy for the town of princeton with the least number of wind turbine on our site . our strategy be to install the least number of unit that minimize the community and environmental impact , while still generate the great amount of renewable energy possible for the resident of the town of princeton . in December @card@ , pmld start the public process to look at the various option regard the future of our wind farm . one of pmld energy strategy be too provide our customer with affordable , long term fix pricing for electricity , from environmentally sound or renewable energy supply . one of the option discuss include upgrade the existing wind farm with the new wind turbine technology . the elect board of light commissioner represent the resident of the town of Princeton decide that upgrade the existing site would be preferable to establish a new wind farm site in town . upgrade the existing @card@ year site would allow us to take advantage of both the existing infrastructure already in place and the community support for the existing location . in the time since the original equipment be install , the wind industry have mature significantly . equipment reliability and cost effectiveness have improve significantly . the equipment capacity or size have also increase dramatically lead much large turbine and tower . there be essentially no manufacturer today that produce a commercial wind turbine in the size or scale of our existing turbine . cost effective wind energy production only occur by invest in large capacity system . new wind turbine be typically size between @card@ kw to @card@ kw and be mount on @card@ ' to @card@ ' tower . the large the capacity , the more cost effective a wind farm become . also , at high height , a give turbine will generate more electricity due to typically high than average wind speed . section @card@ : project description to upgrade pmld ' s existing wind farm pmld , through its elect board of light commission , start consider the various alternative to operate our existing wind farm at a public meeting hold on December @card@ , @ord@ this meeting and the result wind farm research and analysis lead to special town ballot vote in february @card@ by the community to approve upgrade our existing wind farm . the community overwhelmingly support the upgrade project and as a result of this support , pmld intend to remove the eight existing 40kw wind turbine mount on @card@ ' tower and replace them with two new , 1.5mw to 1.6mw wind turbine mount on @card@ meter tower . the new wind turbine will produce approximately @card@ % of our town ' s annual energy requirement in a cost effective manner . @card@ % of the electricity will remain in town and pmld do not plan to sell the electricity to other entity . the electricity generate will reduce our town load and therefore reduce the amount of energy pmld purchase through wholesale contract , ppa ' S , or at market rate . the environmental and community impact be relatively small base on the fact that pmld already operate a wind farm on our @card@ acre site over the past @card@ year . this community own small scale wind project successfully demonstrate that renewable energy plant can be site responsibly and size appropriately within the environment they be mean to protect . this project reaffirm our commitment to renewable energy , reduce our dependency on fossil fuel energy , and reduce our town ' s energy cost while balance the environmental and community impact . this relatively small scale project only make economic sense because pmld be utilize exist infrastructure at our wind farm site . relocate to another site would require many more wind turbine to offset the additional infrastructure cost associate with a typical wind farm project . any other site in princeton would require significantly more cost relate to site acquisition , electrical interconnection , site preparation , wind resource measurement , and most importantly , community acceptance . new site would ultimately require many more turbine in order to justify the increase infrastructure cost . pmld further believe that install only two new unit minimize the impact to the environment while still provide a significant amount of renewable energy to the resident / ratepayer of princeton ma . pmld consider the follow criterion in order to determine that upgrade our existing site make the most economic and environmental sense . exposure to prevail wind : the prevailing wind in princeton be from the northwest . site with multiple turbine must be locate perpendicular to the direction of the prevailing wind . potential site must not be downrange of high geographical terrain locate northwesterly of any potential site . high terrain or natural barrier locate in the northwest vicinity of potential site will create wind turbulence which decrease energy production . the existing wind farm have very good exposure to the northwest prevailing wind without any natural terrain feature that would cause turbulence . elevation : wind speed increase substantially with high elevation . high location have a great potential wind resource . high elevation also help minimize the height of the wind tower . our existing site have an elevation of @card@ , @card@ ' and be one of the high elevation around not include wachusett mountain ( @card@ , @card@ ' ) and little wachusett ( @card@ , @card@ ' ) , both already own by the department of conservation and recreation . exist land use : land that be already own by the town should be consider first . pmld also consider ; proximity to residential neighborhood , setback from public road , whether or not anther site could be purchase or lease , and whether or not the land be own by another governmental agency . the cost to acquire and develop new land would make this project too expensive and uneconomical . pmld ' s existing wind farm site already exist and be own by the town and control by pmld ; the natural terrain in the vicinity of the wind farm mask the view from much of the surround area ; and most importantly , the residential of the town of Princeton vote to acquire this property as a wind farm site back on @card@ , before the surrounding area be acquire by the department of conservation and recreation ( dcr ) . road access : the existing access road along stage coach trail be suitable with minor alteration , to receive the new turbine and construction equipment . the existing access road be formerly a county road to the summit of wachusett mountain but now own by the department of conservation and recreation ( dcr ) . as an alternative to the existing access road , pmld have a legal right of way ( row ) to the wind farm site that will be develop to the event continue access along stage coach trail be not allow . this alternative be still economical and would only require the construction of a new @card@ ' by @card@ ' access road to our site . transmission line access : pmld already own and operate an adequately sized , 3-phase , @card@ , 800v , overhead distribution line to the existing site . the existing overhead electric line be capable of handle the new electric load without major modification . significant tree clearance , line construction , and access would be require for other potential site that be not in the vicinity of exist distribution line . pmld ' S exist electric distribution system in not adequate size in most other location in the town of princeton . upgrade our existing electrical distribution to another site would require a significant investment by pmld and make most other site unfeasible . section @card@ : summary of option pmld consider there be a number of option pmld consider in upgrade the existing wind farm : invest the minimum amount to keep it run until failure and dismantle it . this would involve minimal investment and eliminate the wind-farm over time . this would reduce Princeton ' s amount of renewable energy . pmld could then decide whether or not to retain control of the site or sell the land and right of way . upgrade the existing wind turbine with small scale ( 50kw - 250kw ) commercial wind turbine . the project amount of electricity generate would increase between @card@ % depend on the size and quantity of unit . the economics be very poor with no annual saving , negative net present value , and would lead to high electricity rate . new unit in this scale be no longer available from many of the lead wind turbine manufacturer . upgrade the existing wind turbine with intermediate scale ( 500kw - 750kw ) commercial wind turbine . the project amount of electricity generate would increase between @card@ % depend on the size and quantity of unit . various cost analysis of this option illustrate a negative return on investment for this option . intermediate sized turbine be become less attractive because similar sight issue exist as compare to the large scale turbine . since there be a negative return on investment , pmld decide not to pursue this option . replace the existing turbine and tower with large scale unit . this be option be more cost effective and would produce a large percentage of renewable energy for the town of princeton . the option include turbine mount on tower from @card@ ' to @card@ ' . wind turbine in this range be size between @card@ , 000kw to @card@ , 000w . these turbine become more cost effective and generate positive net present value and annual cost saving . additionally , private partner may be willing to participate in finance the project since more energy and attribute be available to trade . section @card@ : community support for upgrade project pmld through its elect board of light commission start research the wind farm alternative in a public meeting hold on December @card@ , @ord@ this meeting lead to a the recommended strategy to upgrade the existing wind farm , with few but much large turbine in the 1.5mw range , mount on @card@ ' - @card@ ' monopole tower . the environmental and community impact be relatively small base on already operate a wind farm on our site for the past @card@ year . the resident stakeholder also support this project as demonstrate in our survey and ballot vote to approve the project as present by pmld . winter survey result : a total @card@ , @card@ survey be mail to each resident in the town of princeton . @card@ survey be return which be a @card@ % response rate . this response rate be very high for a survey but clearly indicate the level of interest in town for the project . winter @card@ customer survey result : @card@ return survey out of @card@ , @card@ , @card@ % response rate @card@ % support continue investment in wind farm @card@

@card@ , @ord@ the elected board of light commissioner request a ballot vote for the resident of princeton . the result would determine the level of support for this project and the board of light commissioner would honor the wish of the voting stakeholder . the overwhelming majority of resident vote in favor of the project . approximately @card@ % of the voter support the new wind farm project . this level of support reaffirm the elect board of light commissioner decision to support and approve the project to install two much large unit at our exit wind farm site . see attached election ballot question and result support for this project be base on the follow ratepayer / stakeholder benefit : provide at least @card@ year of renewable energy economically reduce our town ' s energy cost diversify the town ' S source of electricity and dependency on one bulk supplier increase the amount of renewable energy utilize as a town to @card@ % reduce dependency on fossil fuel and

public meeting with the wind farm as topic of discussion prior to the special town vote on february @card@ , @ord@ over @card@ article be publish in our local newspaper , the landmark , from December @card@ through November @ord@ see attachment : certified copy of vote relate to wind farm upgrade project section @card@ : turbine operation wind turbine be relatively simple system that generate electricity when wind condition be between @card@ and @card@ m / S , the speed at which the turbine blade experience sufficient lift to begin rotate , and @card@ to @card@ m / S , depend on the manufacturer and model . each wind turbine can be consider a fully self-controlled power unit . a wind turbine consist of the rotate blade fix around the hub , a main drive shaft , a gearbox assembly , a generator , the control cabinet locate inside the base of the tower , the tower , the concrete foundation and a transformer locate either at the base of the turbine or pad-mounted adjacent to the tower base . the control of all energy production and ancillary equipment will be through multiple programmable logic controller ( plc ) , which interface with computer at each turbine . wind turbine be design to be operate in an automatic mode ; however , turbine may also be manually control for specific situation , such as reset follow turbine trip and when weather condition prevent automatic operation . all of the wind turbine will be control through a remote scada system location at pmld ' s operation center . preventative maintenance datum and fault condition will be provide real-time to pmld in order to control operation of the wind turbine . during after-hour , on-call personal be expect to be respond on site within @card@ minute of any condition that require personal attention . wind farm operator will make regular trip to the site in order to ensure the turbine be in operate condition at all time , for regular unit maintenance and for overall project surveillance . the wind turbine will undergo semi-annual scheduled maintenance , which can require from one to two day per turbine . the o & m system will be implement so only one turbine will be require to go off-line at a time for scheduled maintenance . in this manner , maintenance will result in minimal effect on the overall wind farm availability and energy generation . the schedule maintenance will not require the use of crane , as the crew can access the equipment from the ladder locate in the tower , and can easily be handle by a two-man crew . the project will not require fencing , as most of the equipment will be install within the tower , which will be large tubular structure , safely secured and impossible to scale . the individual transformer will be the only piece of equipment accessible and these be well secured and safe for the general public . see attachment : neg micon , main specification nm82 wind turbine , @card@ section @card@ : project cost estimate typical wind farm project cost between $ @card@ , @card@ and $ @card@ , @card@ per kw of turbine capacity . for this project , a @card@ , @card@ - 3 , 300kw wind farm consist of two turbine will cost between $ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and $ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ to construct . actual quote be solicit and receive by the project team . section @card@ : federal and state credit and rebate renewable portfolio standard the commonwealth of massachusetts have establish a renewable portfolio standard ( rps ) that investor own power supplier must meet . investor own energy provider must provide a certain amount of renewable energy to massachusetts customer . municipal light plant be exempt , but it make good sense to follow these high standard . our project produce renewable energy that be consume at the point of the generation by the town of princeton . it also generate rps certificate that be tradable be a separate non-energy relate market similar to pollution credit . the quantity of the certificate that a site can generate be equal to the amount of energy . the value be market base , but initial discussion with potential buyer have place the value at approximately $ @card@ - $ @card@ per kwh . renewable energy portfolio incentive municipal light department be also eligible for a federal rebate call the renewable energy production incentive ( repi ) . this be an annual cash rebate give to any municipal that generate new renewable energy . the program be congressionally approve on an annual basis and have be in effect for the last @card@ year . the current rebate be fix at $ @card@ per kwh . section @card@ : energy production estimate pmld propose to install two turbine rate between @card@ , @card@ , 300kw mount on @card@ meter tower . this business model be base on the neg 72c @card@ meter tower , @card@ meter rotor wind turbine . pmld ' s site plan review and construction permit be base on a maximum tower height of @card@ meter . pmld may consider a 1.65mw turbine as an alternative in order to produce more electricity than the propose 1.5mw turbine . the most important factor in determine whether or no this project be viable , be accurately measure and quantify our wind resource at our site . the wind resource at our site have be measure at various height since july @ord@ pmld be also able to use its original wind datum collect between @card@ and @card@ and wind datum from a nearby municipal airport to verify our site specific wind resource . three separate energy production estimate be prepare for various sized turbine at our site . the preferred turbine at this time be the neg micon nm72c @card@ , 500kw wind turbine mount on a @card@ meter tower . pmld ' s financial analysis be base on a conservative production estimate of @card@ , @card@ , @card@ kwh annually and a capacity factor of @card@ % . this be also the small production estimate of the various wind turbine consider for this project . pmld may utilize another manufacturer and model once final bid be receive . pmld will verify the final energy production estimate once a final bid be receive and accept . it be important to note that our construction permit be base on the installation of @card@ meter tower only . pmld can install slightly large 1.65mw turbine , but they must be install on @card@ meter tower . see attached energy production analysis : university of massachusetts , renewable energy research laboratory , wind turbine report complete November @card@ wind resource evaluation for cei / pmld , allen becker and richard simon , December @card@ , @card@ neg micon , production estimate , September @card@ , @card@ section @card@ : financial analysis pmld be undertake this upgrade project because of our commitment to renewable energy , to reduce our bulk or wholesale electric cost , and , to maintain stable and cost effective retail electricity rate for our customer throughout princeton . the primary benefit associate with this project be relatively low cost electricity that isn ' t affect by fluctuate fossil fuel cost . give that we be use wind as the source of energy for this project , our fuel cost be zero and as long as there be wind , pmld will generate a significant portion of its energy requirement from the wind turbine . pmld ' s wind farm will generate enough energy and capacity to significantly reduce our town ' S requirement . pmld estimate the wind farm will produce approximately @card@ % of the town ' s energy requirement annually . the wind farm be separately meter within pmld ' s service territory and there be no transmission or distribution cost associate with this project . the existing infrastructure from our original wind farm be adequate to service the new wind turbine . @card@ % of the energy and capacity generate will remain in the town of princeton and will not be sell to other entity . the net difference between our total town load and wind generation be what pmld will have to purchase through ppa ' S , energy contract , or market rate . the long term cost forecast for energy be significantly high than the all in $ / kwh to produce energy from our propose wind farm project . market and contract rate for electricity be approach $ @card@ / mwh to $ @card@ / mwh deliver to our lmp ( service territory ) . the all in cost to produce electricity through the wind turbine be approximately $ @card@ / mwh include repayment of the bond principal , o & m , insurance , and extended warranty over the @card@ year life of the project . the total project cost of $ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ be determine by solicit quote from various construction firm and the wind turbine manufacture directly . some of the cost associate with the project be determine use estimate per unit cost . some of the project cost fluctuate widely such as transportation , steel , and euro exchange rate . fluctuation in these cost could impact our final cost once the project be finance . chart @card@ itemize the various cost component of this project . the bulk of the project cost be directly relate to the purchase and delivery of wind turbine . the schedule of estimated payment and approximate timeline be also include in chart @ord@ chart @card@ be pmld ' s financial analysis calculate the annual energy cost saving , net present value ( npv ) , and internal rate of return ( irr ) on the project . the objective of the project be to generate electricity cheap than what it would otherwise cost pmld to purchase . this project achieve that objective and pmld estimate the project will generate approximately $ @card@ , @card@ in annual saving in our energy budget . pmld be confident that its wind farm upgrade project can produce less expensive electricity than purchase electricity through either ppa ' s , contract , or local spot market for electricity . this difference will reduce our energy cost and result in more stable electric rate for our customer . the net present value ( npv ) of the project be positive and the irr be @card@ % . the life of the project be @card@ year which match the operational life of new wind turbine . pmld ' s financial analysis do not include the financial benefit derive from sell our renewable portfolio standard credit ( rps ) and also do not include the financial benefit of receive the repi credit from the federal government ( see section @card@ for more information relate to these benefit ) . both of these financial benefit could produce an estimate $ @card@ , @card@ and $ @card@ , @card@ in additional project revenue per year for rps and repi respectively . the rps estimate of $ @card@ , @card@ be base on sell the credit at $ @card@ / mwh . the repi credit of $ @card@ , @card@ be base on the federal government continue to issue the credit at $ @card@ / mwh . overall our financial analysis be base on conservative assumption and estimate . the project cost of $ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ finance through creb bond over the @card@ year life of the project will cost pmld approximately $ @card@ , @card@ annually in bond repayment . the combined cost relate to the project annual bond principal repayment , insurance ,

benefit the environmental benefit can be calculate use various method . our wind generator can offset or eliminate the need for fossil fuel power plant . carbon dioxide emission from power plant be the lead cause of greenhouse gas . a similar sized power plant fuel by coal , oil , or natural gas emit approximately thousand of pound of co2 , nox , and so2 annually . the wind farm contribute to the reduction of this pollution by eliminate our dependency of fossil fuel power plant . since carbon dioxide be absorb by tree , our wind farm can absorb as much as @card@ , @card@ acre of forest . another analogy use , be to equate the energy generate by the wind farm to the amount generate by a barrel of oil . pmld ' s wind farm can generate the same amount of energy annually as @card@ , @card@ barrel of oil . pmld ' s wind farm will offset emission ( pollution ) from other regional source of electricity . if we do not install our wind farm and generate approximately @card@ , @card@ , @card@ kwh of renewable energy annually , the same amount of energy generate from oil , coal or natural gas would create the follow estimated emission : Princeton ' s wind farm will offset emission by : @card@ million lbs of carbon dioxide @card@ , @card@ lbs of nitrogen oxide @card@ , @card@ lbs of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide be the primary gas involve in global warming . rise global temperature be expect to raise the sea level , change precipitation and alter other climate condition base on @card@ , @card@ lbs co2 per mwh generate nitrogen oxide contribute to the formation of smog , acid rain and toxic chemical by react with other compound in the air . nox emission also contribute to the deterioration of water quality by increase nitrogen loading . base on @card@ lbs nox per mwh generate sulfur dioxide contribute to respiratory illness and aggravate existing heart and lung disease ; damage tree , crop , stone and other material ; increase acidity in soil , lake and other body of water ; and increase visibility impairment . sulfur dioxide form particulate that can be transport over long distance and deposit far from the point of origin . base on @card@ lbs so2 per mwh generate data source for emission calculate : u.s. environmental protection agency , emission & generation resource integrated database http : / / replaced-dns / cleanenergy / egrid / pdfs / replaced-dns section @card@ : access road choice our primary choice for access to the site be stage coach trail . site plan review focus on the re-development of stage coach trail . as an alternative , pmld could develop its legal right-of-way in the event continue access along stage coach trail be not possible . department of conservation and recreation ( dcr ) access road : pmld currently utilize an existing access ( see attach locus map of site in this section ) road call stage coach trail . this @card@ , @card@ ' trail be a discontinued " county road " that be use to reach the summit of mount wachusett back in the late @card@ ' S . this access road be own and control by dcr . pmld have have an informal agreement to utilize the road as an alternative to develop our legal right of way ( alternative access road ) on westminster road since @ord@ since the existing access road be already develop , it make more environmental sense to continue use the existing access road and not develop a second access road to the site along our legal right-of-way . the existing access road need minor improvement in order to deliver the turbine equipment to the site during the construction phase of this project . the improvement will include grade and compaction of the access road so that the heavy equipment can be deliver . once the project be complete , access to the site will occur @card@ day per month . during the winter month access will be limit and the access road will not be plow or utilize by vehicle , except in an emergency . pmld ' s maintenance personnel will hike up the trail in order to check operation during the winter month . pmld ' s computer control system ( scada ) will monitor the turbine @card@ hour a day and notify pmld staff in the event of a problem with the site . the minor alteration to the existing access road include regard with pervious gravel material , compact the gravel , repair exist drainage facility , and remove tree along the edge of stage coach trail . all of the minor alteration and repair be necessary in order to deliver the turbine tower , blade , and generator to the site . the entrance into our @card@ acre site at the top of the access road also require modification during construction . this be necessary for the long piece of equipment such as the turbine blade . the blade will be deliver in one piece approximately @card@ ' long . the turn radius be therefore fairly wide . the turn radius require us to temporarily remove the stone wall along our site boundary . pmld will temporarily remove approximately @card@ ' of rock wall where stage coach trail make a left into pmld ' S property . all of the stone wall will be reconstruct and return to their original location once construction be complete . a relatively small number of tree will be remove along the side of the access road and at the entrance into pmld ' S property , in order to facilitate the turn radius and delivery of equipment . pmld will replace the same number and specie of tree in any location dem request in order to mitigate the environmental impact . @card@ tree great than @card@ ' in diameter along row @card@ tree between @card@ ' @card@ ' in diameter along row @card@ tree between @card@ " - @card@ ' in diameter along row @card@ tree less @card@ " in diameter along row at entrance to our @card@ acre site after construction , the access road and entrance to our site will be return to its original condition . access to the site for preventative and corrective maintenance will be manage accordingly : summer access : once per month , primarily use 4x4 pickup and material handling truck . pmld can schedule these preventative maintenance visit in order to minimize impact to hiker and other user of the trial and reservation . winter access : the access road will not be plow during the winter . access will be limit to pmld staff walk to the site in order to perform preventive maintenance and safety inspection . pmld ' s right of way : if dcr do not allow pmld to continue use the existing access road , pmld will utilize its alternative easement access ( see location on attach locus map ) and construct an access road along its legal right of way ( row ) off westminster road . the legal row be approximately @card@ ' long by @card@ ' and be include as an easement over dcr property . pmld would remove a large number of tree along the row ( see table below ) in order to develop a suitable access road to our site . a large number of additional tree would also be remove on pmld ' s property as well , in order to get from the end of the row to pmld ' S turbine . @card@ public shade tree great than @card@ ' in diameter at entrance to row @card@ tree great than @card@ ' in diameter along row @card@ tree between @card@ ' @card@ ' in diameter along row @card@ tree between @card@ " - @card@ ' in diameter along row @card@ tress less @card@ " in diameter along row the access road would require strip the tree stump and loam , cut a passable grade , fill with suitable rock tailing , and finish with compactable gravel fill . the cost to complete this work be include in the project budget . distribution line access : pmld installed @card@ ' of overhead electrical distribution line ( see attach locus map for location of exist electrical line ) from westminster road , over dcr property , to the southern corner of our @card@ acre site in @ord@ the overhead distribution line feed our existing wind farm and be design adequately to support the new wind turbine without modification . pmld will request dcr to formalize our exist @card@ year agreement with a @card@ ' by @card@ ' aerial easement over dcr property in order to maintain the existing electrical distribution line to our property . section @card@ : location and construction plan for turbine multiple turbine be typically site in row perpendicular to the prevailing wind . our site experience a north-west prevailing wind . in order to prevent turbulence from one turbine to another , the turbine be typically space at least three blade diameter apart . in our case , only two unit will be install so spacing be not a serious concern . the turbine will be locate entirely on pmld property and no part of the turbine or blade will protrude over our property boundary . unit @card@ will be locate in the northeast corner of our property . unit @card@ will be locate in the southwest corner of the property . the unit will be space approximately @card@ ' apart . construction plan have be complete and submit to the town of princeton , build inspector for permit . pmld receive a building permit on November @card@ , @ord@ see attachment : locus map with turbine coordinate construction plan for propose turbine section @card@ : foundation pmld ' S propose wind farm have @card@ - @card@ foot of soil overburden on bedrock . base on observation during our site inspection , the bedrock be of a high quality favorable for rock anchor foundation . these foundation will , however , require significant drilling and anchor . as a result we estimate that the overall cost of the foundation will be significantly high than the more traditional " inverted t " or " p & h cylinder " foundation use for wind turbine foundation in more homogeneous soil . pmld will use standard engineering practice in the design and construction of the foundation . a typical spread footing foundation for unit of this size be approximately @card@ ' x @card@ ' x @card@ ' . most of the spread footing be cover with compacted common fill and only a @card@ ' diameter foundation pedestal be visible above finished grade . due to the sloping terrain at our site , some portion of the spread footing foundation will be expose depend on the slope of the terrain . in case where the terrain slope be steep , rip rap retain wall will be construct to reduce the amount fill require and minimize erosion . section @card@ : land survey , soil boring , and test an update site survey be complete for this project . the survey include pmld ' s property boundary , topography , and the propose location of the turbine , crane pad , turbine lie down and stage area , and the electrical infrastructure . in addition to the survey , soil / rock boring and geotechnical analysis will be perform once construction begin . other ground and site work include ; concrete test for the foundation and soil conductivity test for the design of ground mat . section @card@ : electrical design and connection to pmld ' s distribution facility our electrical design include pad-mount transformer , protective relay , fuse load-break switch , surge arrestors , pt ' s , ct ' s , and hv meter . for our design , we propose ( 2 ) 1500kva oil-filled , fan cool y-y transformer manufacture by siemens . although large transformer could be substitute for this project , as always the tradeoff be between efficiency and cost . base on the wind regime at the princeton wind farm , large and more costly transformer may be warrant upon further economic analysis . the feeder from the first turbine will enter a live-front panel on the second transformer ( turbine close to pmld ' s interconnection line ) , in a daisy-chain configuration . a separate section be provide for meter . pmld will supply our own ct ' s and pt ' s for hv side meter . we have specify meter with a pulse output so that power output can be monitor by the utility via a modem connection . approximately @card@ foot separate the two propose wind turbine . the second turbine be then another @card@ foot from pmld ' s 13.8kv line . pmld specify 350mcm feeder cable for each phase between the turbine . in a separate conduit , an interface cable will be install to enable each turbine to be trip off in the event of a ground fault on the turbine side of each transformer . finally , a third conduit will house the fiber optic line for turbine communication . pmld assume that straightforward trench will be possible to a depth of @card@ ' . should this not be the case , we assume that any ledge removal will be bill as a change order on a cubic yard basis . in area where the minimum 36-inch cover be not achievable , pmld may be require to artificially elevate the ground cover above the feeder trench . meter meter the production of energy will be provide in a separate section of the pad-mount transformer enclosure at the turbine adjacent to pmld ' s 13.8kv interconnection . the propose meter will include a pulse output port so that the utility may dial up and monitor wind farm production remotely . our electrical one-line diagram include a ground fault trip interlock on the meter ' s current transformer . with this arrangement , both turbine can be trip off-line in the event pmld experience an outage on the utility ' s side of the meter . interconnection to electrical distribution system interconnection of the wind farm to pmld ' s electric grid will consist of an existing , @card@ phase hendrix bundle 13.8kv overhead feeder . six existing utility pole connect the wind site electrically to pmld ' s electrical distribution system . underground feeder to each turbine will be install from the last existing utility pole on pmld ' S property . pmld will isolate the wind farm from its distribution system with a pole-mounted , fuse disconnect with a ground level operate handle . supervisory control and datum acquisition ( scada ) a variety of scada alternative be available for the propose princeton wind farm . the small size of this project do not warrant a server-based communication system typically find in large wind farm . pmld have identify scada package " windman express scada system " and " visupro system " as potential scada system for this project . section @card@ : crane access , delivery , and installation pad the existing access road at the propose wind farm will require minimal upgrade . the removal of several tree adjacent to the roadway will be require , and a topcoat of crushed grade gravel may be necessary . during our initial site assessment we note that the radius of curvature at the entrance to pmld ' S property be inadequate . consequently , our proposal include a design for the necessary civil work at this location . this work will require the removal of several tree , the relocation of several stone wall , and re-grading of the area . the stone wall and grade will be reconstruct and return to its current condition after construction be complete . a 300-ton manitowoc @card@ crane will be require for installation of the turbine . this crane be transport via fifteen tractor-trailer truck and assemble on-site . in its unassembled form , only a 12-14-foot roadway be require for access of the crane assembly . once construct , however , this crane will require a 26-foot roadway in order to move from one turbine installation site to the next . once pmld ' S land be clear and grub , and the existing wind turbine and infrastructure be remove from the site , we anticipate that the crane will be able to be travel between the two turbine location without require full demobilization . the installation layout and construction of stage area on our @card@ acre site be significant . if the rotor be pre-assembled on the ground ( the most desire and economical method ) , almost an acre of space will be require at each turbine site . because the existing topography at both of the propose turbine site be irregular , fill material will be require . the slope of the layout area at the turbine site need to be relatively flat for turbine assembly . additional cut and fill may be necessary at our site . section @card@ : turbine shipping and delivery mass-highway must be contact to coordinate route access and clearance along highway and town road lead to our site . the turbine be typically ship on @card@ semi-trailer sized truck . the tower be deliver in three piece , each blade

department ( pmld ) , own and operate the @card@ acre wind farm site off westminster road . pmld have complete control and maintenance of the land since it be purchase with electric ratepayer revenue in @ord@ the site include an @card@ ' x @card@ ' right of way off westminster road . as an alternative to develop this row , the department of conservation and recreation ( dcr ) allow pmld access through its right of way along stage coach trail since @card@ in order to minimize the environmental impact of an additional access road to the same site . a site plan will be create detail all topographic detail , cut and fill , and grade change . upon completion of the installation , topsoil will be reapplied over all of the clear area , and the site will be vegetate . pmld will request both dcr and ma audubon to recommend what state the clear portion of the @card@ acre be return to , when construction be complete . the site could be allow to return to its natural state ( forest ) or the site could be maintain as open-space with periodic brush cut and mow . maintain the site as open-space will ensure more accurate post avian study . pmld will not install exterior lighting on the site except for the faa require light on top of each tower . the gravel access road will be maintain to allow access to the site . pmld and outsourced preventative maintenance worker will visit the site approximately two day per month during the spring , summer and fall . pmld will not access the site by vehicle during the winter month unless there be an emergency . the turbine equipment will be monitor remotely by pmld ' s scada system and site access will be minimal during the winter month . the exist improve gravel access road on our @card@ acre site will remain after construction be complete . the access road will end with enough room for vehicle to turn around . no dedicated parking space will be construct or be necessary . trail access during construction pmld will coordinate construction activity in order to minimize impact on visitor and hiker to the reservation . although the construction schedule anticipate @card@ week of construction to complete the project , only small portion of the that time will involve heavy use and activity on stage coach trail . grade and compact the road will take approximately @card@ week , delivery and pour the cement will take approximately @card@ week , and delivery of the turbine and tower will take approximately @card@ week . all other work will take place on pmld ' S site and only require vehicle access along stage coach trail . pmld will work with dcr to coordinate the timing of construction , trail access , and alternative access to the reservation trail system during construction . section @card@ : project schedule pmld develop a 36-week project schedule outline all of the major design and construction task . this schedule account for all long lead item , a likely ground break project start date , and include " adverse weather " day . give that the physical turbine erection will take place during the relatively calm summer month , we have include only minimal " adverse weather day " for this task . moreover , we have assume that the crane be use for the installation will not require a complete demobilization and remobilization when move between the two turbine site . our preliminary project schedule be break down into various task . long lead time equipment and significant task include : wind turbine have a @card@ month lead-time transformer and various switchgear item have between @card@ week lead time site preparation and access road work take @card@ month drilling and pad construction take @card@ month the foundation must cure for at least @card@ day before concrete testing and consequent turbine installation the turbine be install by crane in @card@ week turbine commission be complete within @card@ week early ground breaking : the long lead-time require for the wind turbine provide project flexibility , as the design and construction task can be complete well within a @card@ month timeframe . this allow us to complete all site work well before turbine delivery be anticipate . heavy snowfall will impede the mobilization of erection equipment at the site and therefore turbine erection must be coordinate in the spring , summer or fall month . schedule logic and staffing : the propose project schedule below present a preliminary map of the various construction phase lead up to the installation of the turbine . we believe there be great flexibility with regard to parallel some construction task , although space limitation may limit the productivity of multiple crew at time . once the site be clear and grub , foundation preparation can take place concurrently with trench for the feeder and final site grade and compact . we propose this to ensure that any necessary ledge removal be complete before the foundation be install or the turbine be erect . the manitowoc @card@ require @card@ tractor trailer truck and a crew of six for assembly . pmld plan to mobilize a turbine erection crew consist of two crane operator ( for both the 300-ton crane and the assist crane ) , a crane oiler , and a rigger . the erection crew will include the installer ' s field manager , two turbine erection technician , and an installation supervisor from the turbine manufacturer . once the turbine be install and the transformer and switchgear be in place , a commission crew consist of turbine technician and a turbine manufacturer ' S supervisor will complete final hookup and commission . once on-line , the turbine manufacturer ' S supervisor will provide two full day of training for pmld . section @card@ : design and installation assumption pmld have make the follow assumption in the development of our price quote for this project : pmld will prepare and submit all necessary and applicable permit pertain to this project . wind turbine foundation be base on the assumption that the bedrock at the propose site be suitable for a " typical " design . ultimately , the result of a site-specific geotechnical analysis will dictate the final foundation design and consequent cost . gravel / fill material be available at a nearby gravel pit . excavation to a depth of @card@ foot . we have tentatively assume that excavation for trench and foundation will not require ledge removal . should ledge removal be require , the installation contractor will be require to do the necessary drilling , blast , and removal . sale or usage tax have not be include in our price quote . applicable import duty be include in the price of the turbine . electrical service will be require during the installation of the propose wind turbine . the existing transformer at pmld ' s wind site will remain operative during the project , and that supplementary portable electric generator will not be require . during the installation of the turbine , pmld assume that the 300-ton manitowoc crane will require only one day of mobilization / demobilization between the two turbine site . although pmld have request turnkey quote , we may complete some of the installation task associate with this project in order to reduce cost . all price quote develop herein reflect complete turnkey service . some of the task in this scope of work will be complete with 12-hour workday . pmld assume that there will be no problem associate with access or construction during these extended workday . loss of use ( business interruption insurance ) be not include in this proposal but will be require once the unit be in operation . transportation estimate provide by wind turbine manufacturer vary significantly . actual freight cost may differ at the time of ship and will be reflect in final project price . section @card@ : wind turbine erection method pmld propose to use a 300-ton manitowoc @card@ series c crane with a luff jib to erect the wind turbine . the installation contractor must have relationship with several crane service in the massachusetts region that can provide crane of this size . a sample wind turbine assembly layout be include in appendix @ord@ the erection sequence will be carry out in standard format : tower section and nacelle be place , then follow by the complete rotor assembly ( the rotor will require all open area at the lift site during its assembly ) . all weather and safety precaution will be take . the secondary ( small ) crane will be use to support this erection sequence . section @card@ : preventative maintenance and turbine operation preventative maintenance the project cost will include a @card@ year maintenance agreement with the manufacturer . the unit will be maintain by the manufacturer accord to their recommended schedule . pmld ' S staff will accompany the manufacturer during every pm visit during the first @card@ year in order to learn the manufacturer ' s pm process . pmld will assume pm in year four if the manufacturer certify our staff proficient and honor the extended manufacturer warranty . manufacturer ' s warranty the project cost will include a 2-year manufacturer ' S warranty . pmld will purchase an additional 3-year manufacturer ' s warranty to cover the equipment through year @card@ . construction insurance pmld will require the installation contractor to purchase full insurance coverage for this project include liability , site , and equipment breakage for the construction period . corrective maintenance insurance pmld will purchase property insurance to cover all major corrective maintenance and catastrophic equipment failure include lightning , mechanical failure , tower collapse , etc . the insurance policy will include power replacement coverage as well , to ensure that pmld do not incur any cost for replacement power in the event the turbine be off-line due to corrective maintenance or catastrophic equipment failure . hazardous material no hazardous material will be store on site . pmld will install oil-filled transformer for this project . the insulate oil be non-hazardous " mineral oil " . each transformer pad will include emergency oil overflow reservoir . as the propose wind turbine be induction machine , they require a significant volume of gearbox oil . standard preventative practice will be employ to ensure that this oil do not enter the environment during the installation and operation of the turbine . the transformer and gearbox will be inspect monthly during preventative maintenance visit to ensure containment of oil base insulation and lubricate fluid . spare and special tool all turbine manufacturer will provide a detailed list of recommended spare item . the manufacturer will determine the most appropriate spare inventory for this project . pmld will contact other municipal and private wind farm to coordinate a spare part inventory list . life span and decommission the life span of a wind turbine be about @card@ year and occasionally up to @card@ year . at this stage , the turbine can either be replace or remove . turbine can be remove as quickly as they be erect ( about one per day ) . the foundation and underground cable can be remove from the site , but it be generally recommend that foundation be simply cover over , and that track and cable be allow to remain . the scrap value of the turbine will generally cover a proportion of the cost of decommission . the board of light commissioner will decide what to do with the turbine at the end of their useful life . section @card@ : operational issue potential source of pollution wind energy be an extremely clean electricity source . no airborne or other pollutant be emit during the operation of the wind turbine . wind turbine do require the use of hydraulic and / or gearbox oil . transformer be oil-cooled use non-hazardous mineral oil . any potential oil leak would be contain inside the turbine tower or transformer pedestal and would be prevent from reach the surround environment by enclose basin capable of retain @card@ % of the oil holding capacity . also , the transformer will be install on an impermeable concrete slab , with a lip design to contain any oil spill . no harmful waste or pollutant will be discharge into the environment during the construction time period . all normal precautionary measure and standard construction practice will be implement to minimize disturbance to the site , control runoff and sedimentation , noise level , dust emission , to avoid oil or fuel spill , and to collect waste . as a precautionary measure , the project will allow only construction and crane equipment in good repair on site . furthermore , emergency response spill kit will be maintain on site in the event of the loss of containment of hazardous fluid . noise level be expect to increase during the construction period . road grader , construction equipment , crane and increase traffic will be the major source of noise , which will result in minor inconvenience for local resident and hiker . potential cause of resource conflict recreational land use around the construction site be expect to be temporarily affect during construction only . as such , no resource use conflict be expect between the wind power project and recreational use of the neighboring reservation . other land use in the area be limit and no particular resource conflict be expect with the implementation and operation of the wind turbine . construction period mitigation measure in order to minimize the amount of environmental impact the project could generate , certain mitigation measure will be implement . prevention of non-native vegetation specie from colonize the area ( disperse by machinery and worker ) by ensure the machinery be clean timing of construction : undertake to minimize impact on the soil and vegetation use exist road as much as possible avoid ecologically sensitive area should any object of archaeological value be find during construction , work should stop temporarily to allow a qualified archaeologist to assess the importance of the finding and devise a suitable mitigation plan , include buffer to protect the site . minimize the amount of vegetation remove from the site . avoid construction during avian nest season silt control to monitor the amount of silt create by the access road . these measure will be include in a detailed environmental protection plan ( Epp ) that will be develop and submit to the department of environment prior to the onset of the project construction activity . emergency access and park the access road on pmld ' S site will act as parking for the site and can accommodate the turn radius of operation and emergency vehicle . site light no site lighting will be install except for the faa require tower light ( see section @card@ ) drainage and strom water the access road will be design use pervious gravel and material . no special drainage be require because the road be pervious ( see construction document for more detail ) . the access road will be design to accommodate and properly discharge storm water and snow melt . security of site turbine be monopole structure with lockable porthole type door . turbine be climb from within the tower use osha approve lad safe system . the monopole can not be climb on the outside . the door to each turbine be lock at all time and access through the door be monitor through the scada system monitor at pmld ' s operation center . access road gate the access road to the site will be gate and lock at all time . only authorize employee and contractor will be allow to utilize the access road . key to the gate will be maintain at pmld , wachusett mountain visitor center , princeton police department , and the princeton fire department . site fence the site will remain open and unfenced . the tower and transformer will be lock and appropriate signage will indicate the potential damage to equipment and personnel if the device be tamper with . site perimeter signage pmld will install signage around the perimeter of the site to inform the public the site be the town of Princeton ' s wind farm . the signage will also inform the public that the site be a renewable energy generation facility ; it will also provide a phone number , monitor @card@ hour a day , for emergency and question . the perimeter sign dimension will be approximately @card@ ' x @card@ ' mount on steel post . energy kiosk and display pmld will also install am energy kiosk at the entrance to our wind farm to provide the public with information describe ; what the wind farm be , why it be construct , the annual energy produce , safety concern , and emergency phone number . the kiosk will be locate on pmld ' s property at the corner of the access road and the @card@ acre site . the @card@ ' x @card@ ' display will be construct to match similar display within the wachusett mountain reservation . section @card@ : visual impact most form of electricity generation have drawback . for example , the air pollution and greenhouse gas result from oil , coal , or natural gas generate electricity can ' t be see , but be serious in term of impact on human health and on the environment . with wind power , what you see be what you get . wind farm be clean , and very visible . the installation of a two , @card@ meter tall wind turbine in a rural and mostly wooded location will certainly be visible from various location . even our exist eight @card@ ' wind turbine be visible from various location in the area . the wind turbine be site in the environment they be mean to protect . the turbine be well mask by the nature tree canopy and the natural rolling topography surround the site . the tubular tower and the aerodynamic blade have be design with smooth line that tend to have great aesthetic value than our old lattice tower type wind turbine . they be consider attractive industrial structure . improvement in technology have also lower the speed of the turbine . our exit existing turbine spin at approximately @card@ rpm ' S , while the new , but much large turbine spin at only @card@ rpm ' S . this slow speed reduce noise and create a more aesthetically pleasing site . photo simulation be create by the renewable energy research laboratory at the university of massachusetts . pmld float two balloon at the 70m hub height in order to create a reference point for some of the photo simulation . see attached photo simulation of wind farm from various location photo simulation from scenic overlook ledge to wind farm photo simulation from wachusett mountain summit to wind farm photo simulation from brown hill to wind farm photo simulation from @card@ thompson road to wind farm photo simulation from @card@ westminster road to wind farm photo simulation from @card@ westminster road to wind farm photo simulation from @card@ westminster to wind farm photo simulation between @card@ and @card@ westminster to wind farm flicker shadow the rotation of the wind turbine blade during period with low sun angle and bright sun , such as early morning , may result in a flicker , or shadow . this effect be typically limit to the time the sun be directly behind the turbine . since the close private property be @card@ , @card@ ' away from the wind farm , it be unlike any flicker shadow will occur . shadow flicker typically occur when the observer or property be much closer to the turbine and inline with the turbine and sun . see attachment : solar shadow effect , pb power , may @card@ section @card@ : faa require warning light faa advisory circular ac @card@ / 7460-1k state that warning light should be install on wind turbine structure . in order to comply with the faa advisory , pmld select the least intrusive lighting system available , which will minimize the impact to the environment ( bird ) and surround community . pmld will install a medium intensity white strobe light for night and day use . the strobe light will be programme to strobe for the long period of time allow . the flash rate will be approximately @card@ flash per minute during the day and @card@ flash per minute during the night . the slow flash rate allow the lamp to completely darken . this technique have prove to be less distractive to community and avian life . pmld will also utilize fixture that have the low amount of stray light and shield to prevent light pollution below the horizon of the generator enclosure on top of the tower . the light will be locate on top of the generator enclosure , which tend to mask the light from shine directly down . the faa allow cone shield to prevent the light from direct downward . pmld will ensure the light be install in a position on top of the generator enclosure with cone shield in order to prevent stray light from impact the community and environment . faa publish strict guideline on the amount of stray light that can emit below the horizon . in fact , the amount of stray light below the horizon can not exceed @card@ candela , the approximate light intensity of a 60w light bulb . most manufacturer design strobe light so that stray light do not exceed @card@ candela or @card@ / @card@ the amount of the standard . when the time come to specify the strobe light , pmld will ensure we utilize the manufacturer with the low stray light as compare to the faa standard . the faa have determine that our wind farm do not exceed obstruction standard and would not be a hazard to air navigation . see attach : " faa , determination of no hazard to air navigation " date july @card@ , @card@ section @card@ : noise modern wind turbine create very little noise above the natural background noise typically cause by wind . the noise level from the turbine propose at our site be significantly less than the noise level of the existing unit . in order to provide a perspective of sound level , consider the fact that normal conversation be approximately 60dbs . the noise level in a bedroom at night be approximately 30dbs . the sound from a new wind turbine can be equate to tree rustle in the wind or ocean wave break . the small amount of sound at close distance be not intrusive but be consider background noise , similar to wind and ocean sound or even a refrigerator hum . during quiet non-windy day and night , the unit will not operate and there be no noise . generally speak as the wind approach the speed necessary for the turbine to work , you will hear more wind and background related noise than anything else . since the close private property be approximately @card@ , @card@ ' from the turbine , our noise study , complete by umass renewable energy research laboratory and pb power , indicate that without take into consideration wind related background noise and forest or topographic barrier that tend to mask noise , the level of noise at @card@ , @card@ ' will be @card@ db ( a ) . this noise level be slightly louder than whisper . base on our study and include normal wind related background noise , there will be little or no noise , @card@ , @card@ ' ( 670m ) away from the turbine . ( see attach noise study ) it ' S important to reiterate that the existing ( @card@ ) turbine generate significantly more noise than the propose unit . technology improvement and slow blade rotation significantly reduce the noise level of new turbine . base on study ( see figure 1 ) complete by the national renewable energy laboratory ( aiaa-2004-1185 ) , the exist unit generate noise level range from @card@ db ( a ) , at approximately @card@ ' ( measure use hub height plus ½ the blade diameter ) away from the turbine at ground level . figure @card@ , noise characteristic of exist pmld turbine compare to typical background noise base on the manufacturer noise curve ( see figure @card@ ) for a nm82 wind turbine , the noise generate from the propose unit will be approximately @card@ db ( a ) , @card@ ' away from the base of the turbine . noise level will diminish with distance from the turbine and at approximately @card@ , @card@ ' ( 600m ) the noise of the turbine be completely mask by natural background noise . figure @card@ , neg micon nm82 sound power level characteristic , august @card@ acoustic emission measurement conform to applicable element of iec @card@ ` ` acoustic emission measurement . ' ' the purpose of this measurement standard be to document the acoustic emission characteristic of the wind turbine type . this standard be develop to provide a uniform methodology that will ensure consistency and accuracy in the measurement and analysis of acoustic emission by wind turbine generator system ( wtgs ) . see attached noise study : acoustic noise impact assessment , pb power , may @card@ , @card@ university of massachusetts , renewable energy research laboratory , wind turbine report complete November @ord@ locate in section @card@ of this report . section @card@ : avian impact bird fatality at wind generation site be very low . study at existing site indicate only @card@ bird death per turbine per year ( nwcc ) . migrate bird , like hawk , tend to fly above @card@ foot . pmld hire avian expert , Dr. Paul kerlinger of " curry & kerlinger " to analyze potential avian impact at our site ( see attach bird risk report by Paul kerlinger , September @card@ ) . dr. kerlinger be the former audubon director of the cape may bird observatory in new jersey and authore " how bird migrate ( @card@ ) and flight strategy of migrate hawk ( @card@ ) . Dr. kerlinger ' S visit and analysis indicate that avian risk from our project be likely to be low and not significant . in perspective , more bird die annually from the following : @card@ million annually fly into glass window @card@ million from house cat ( source : American bird conservancy ) @card@ million from automobile and truck @card@ million from guy communication tower over @card@ ' from the total number of turbine install in the unite stated , only @card@ , @card@ - @card@ , @card@ avian fatality per year be expect . however , because our site be in a know migration path , pmld will perform a post avian study during the first @card@ year of operation . pmld will request dem and ma audubon ' s assistance in select and approve the post avian study methodology . pmld ' S property be approximately one mile away from the summit of mount wachusett . since there be a large number of migrate hawk during a specific time of the year ( typically october ) , pmld will provide the hawk watch community our emergency contact number in order to alert pmld when condition occur that increase the risk of avian fatality . these event may include low visibility , fog , and specific weather event . in these event , pmld will stop the turbine in order to minimize the risk to migrate bird . bird collision earlier turbine tower design use latticed tower , which be frequently use by raptor as perch location allow for a clear view of open land ( kerlinger , @card@ ) . study have show a predominance of bird strike during take-off , as the bird be carry by the draft into the rotor of downwind-operated turbine . today ' s wind turbine be essentially upwind machine ( i.e. . the rotor be upwind from the tower ) , commonly mount on tubular tower , where raptor have no opportunity to perch . furthermore , large turbine have reduce rotational speed ( @card@ to @card@ rpm ) , which decrease the chance of bird collision . also , recent review of avian impact study conduct at wind power facility in europe and in the unite state reveal that bird turbine interaction result in bird fatality represent extremely minor occurrence . nowhere in europe ( even in tarifa , spain and coastal netherlands ) and in all but one location in the unite state ( altamont pass , ca ) have these impact be judge to be significant or to cause avian population problem or impact rare or threatened specie ( kerlinger , @card@ ) . finally , the number of fatality report at wind plant have be extremely small , especially when compare to other source of human induce mortality as indicate in the table above ( kerlinger , @card@ ) . mitigation and monitoring measure pmld will implement mitigation measure to ensure minimal environmental and avian impact : tubular tower will be install to reduce the possibility of bird perch on the tower . ( tubular tower also improve the aesthetics of the wind farm ) the electrical distribution line connect the wind turbine to pmld distribution system will be install underground . this prevent avian perch point and improve aesthetics . any equipment bring to the site during the construction period will be in good repair , to prevent oil , grease , or other hazardous spill . grass will be plant on disturbed area after construction pmld be commit to develop and implement a post study on the effect of the wind farm project on migrate bird in the area . the high probability of bird strike be during the spring and fall bird migration period . critical migration period ( spring and fall ) will be identify and these period will be the focus of monitor avian fatality associate with the wind farm . this program will determine the level of wind turbine bird mortality during migration . in develop the post study , the pmld will ensure there be clear and achievable objective and hypothesis , temporal and spatial control , and practical methodology . pmld will also consult with regulatory authority and stakeholder to discuss aspect of this study prior its implementation . the study ' S result will help quantify bird mortality during migration period . result of the study will be use to design , implement and eventually evaluate mitigation strategy that may be require to address the bird mortality issue . see attached : bird risk report from dr. kerlinger date September @card@ , @card@ study plan for post-construction monitoring , date february @card@ , @card@ section @card@ : ice the new unit be design to withstand low temperature , wind , and ice condition . ice event that result in significant ice accretion be not common at our location . only @card@ ice event per year be expect at the princeton site . there be two type of ice that can form on wind turbine : glaze and rime ( manwell @card@ ) . meteorologist classify transparent and homogeneous ice similar to ice cube , which form on vertical and horizontal surface , as glaze . its amorphous , dense structure cling tenaciously to any surface on which it form . in contrast , milky and crystalline ice be term rime . rime lack the transparency of glaze , be less dense , and do not cling as tenaciously as glaze . give our site elevation be only @card@ , @card@ ' glaze ice be more common than rime ice . however small the number of ice event be , some small amount of ice will accumulate on either the exist tower and turbine and the new one . this same ice also accrete on the tree surround our site , on our overhead utility line along our road , and on the mature tree canopy that cover stage coach trail adjacent to the wind site . typically , significant ice event last only @card@ hour before melt off the existing turbine and tree . the risk of a hiker be hit by drop ice be less than from the tree give the shape , size , and diameter of the new tower , ice build-up be less of a risk with the new unit as compare to the existing tower . the new tower will be a non-guyed @card@ ' @card@ ' diameter monopole tower . the large diameter and surface area decrease the likelihood of ice accretion as compare to our existing lattice style tower small diameter blade . the new unit also rotate slow at only @card@ rpm as compare to @card@ rpm by the existing unit . the slow blade speed and reduce number of turbine from the exist eight to only two , also reduce the risk of ice accretion and ice throw . pmld will install sensor that monitor ice accretion , which will shut down the turbine during significant ice event . this safety feature be not present on our existing turbine . the turbine control system ( scada ) will send an alert to pmld ' s 24-hour dispatch . once the turbine be shut down and the warning send , pmld ' S staff must visibly check the site for ice accretion . the turbine will not be restart until the ice melt away or be remove by jog the turbine blade ( jog be a quick start and stop operation that flex ' S the fiberglas turbine blade enough to cause the ice to break off and fall to the ground ) . during weather condition that may lead icing , pmld will supervise the wind turbine site more closely . the turbine scada system will monitor the site @card@ hour a day . the control of the turbine will automatically perform the follow function in order to shut down the unit and minimize the risk of ice throw during an ice event . power curve : ice accretion on the blade have a big influence on the lift force and therefore on the power curve of the wind turbine generator ( wtg ) . the power curve be programme into the control system and be always compare with the actual power output . when the mean ( average ) of the power be continuously out of the power curve for @card@ minute , it be an indication that ice have accumulate on the blade and the wtg will be stop automatically . the turbine stay off until it be reset manually by an operator who must physically visit the site to determine if icing be present . if icing be present the operator will jog the turbine to shed the ice or keep the turbine off until the ice melt away naturally . vibration sensor : additional load result from iced blade cause vibration which be monitor by the control system . when the vibration exceed the adjusted limit , the turbine will be stop . the turbine will stay off until it be reset manually again , after an operator physically the visit to determine the cause of the vibration . ice sensor : the ice sensor be install on the roof of the nacelle ( generator enclosure ) . ice sensor measure the temperature and the relative air humidity of the environment . if certain value be measured which indicate ice , the turbine be stop by the control system . the meteorological value be determine from national weather institutes . the turbine can only be restart manually after an operator physically visit the site to ensure the unit be clear of ice and it be safe to restart the unit . in all these case an autonomous restart of the turbine be impossible and ice throw be avoid and minimize . shut down and restart of the turbine be record in the alarm list of the control system and can be provide to anyone request the information to prove the reliability if our system . signage will be fix on the turbine and site perimeter to warn pass pedestrian of the risk . section @card@ : massachusetts historic commission massachusetts historic commission ' S ( mhc ) conduct a site review of the wind farm project , on September @card@ , @ord@ pmld and mhc visit the various historic property and district in princeton as inventory by mhc and include on the national register . the topography of princeton and mature tree canopy generally hide the new turbine from the majority of these site . pmld develop various topographic profile in order to determine that the new wind farm be not visible from many of the historic location . where they be visible , pmld plan to mitigate with appropriate signage and display , explain the wind farm and its associate environmental benefit . overall pmld believe there be no adverse impact on these location . pmld have operate a wind farm in this location for almost @card@ year and we be replace eight turbine with only two new unit . the two new turbine be significantly large but they will not impact the view-shed any more than the original unit . in fact , the new unit operate at a slow , more graceful speed , and the monopole tower tend to be more attractive than our existing lattice style tower . attach be the various topographic profile of each site we visit or discuss . the profile clearly illustrate whether or not the wind farm be visible from the various historic location . ma inventory location be wind farm visible ? bullock ski lodge no dcr visitor center no dcr superintendent ' s house no scenic overlook ledge yes wachusett mountain summit yes edward goodnow house no nation register location princeton center historic center no fernside no the existing wind turbine , install in @card@ , be also visible from some of the mhc inventory location in princeton . since the wind farm may be visible from at two of the inventory location , pmld propose the follow mitigation strategy at three department of conservation and recreation ( dcr ) location . dcr superintendent house this property be currently close and visitor do not utilize the facility . the facility be schedule to be renovate by dcr in the future , as an educational center for the wachusett mountain reservation . give the terrain and mature tree canopy at this location , the turbine will not be visible from the rear of this property . even though the unit be not visible from this location , pmld propose to install a renewable energy education display / kiosk . the educational material in the kiosk would provide information to the public about Princeton ' s wind farm , renewable energy generation , and energy efficient product . this type of static display would also explain the environmental benefit of wind turbine and how they be site within the environment they be mean to protect . pmld would also be available to conduct educational seminar relate to wind energy , for group and individual visit the visitor ' S center . scenic overlook ledge this be the only location that will have a direct view of the two new turbine . this location be along the up-road to the summit of wachusett mountain . pmld be not sure if this location be an inventory historic site , but since it provide a great view of the existing and propose wind turbine , we develop an accurate photo simulation from this location . the attach photo simulation clearly illustrate the existing and propose turbine . the old turbine , which have be visible since @card@ , will be remove once construction begin . pmld believe there be no adverse impact to this location since we be replace the eight turbine with two new unit . the two new turbine be significantly large but they will not impact the view-shed any more than the original unit . in fact , the new unit operate at a slow , more graceful speed , and the monopole tower tend to be more attractive than our existing lattice style tower . pmld propose to install a renewable energy education display / kiosk at this location with dcr approval . a kiosk or static display would explain the renewable energy project and environmental benefit of the wind turbine visible from this location . wachusett mountain summit there be approximately @card@ historic property inventory by mhc at the summit of wachusett mountain . none of these inventory location have a direct view of the existing or propose wind farm . most of the historic viewing location at the summit point in an easterly direction away from the wind farm . the new turbine will be visible from the summit in a southwesterly direction from the junction of harrington trail and the fire tower . the wind farm be approximately @card@ mile away . pmld be able to accurately create a photo simulation of the new wind turbine from one location on the summit of wachusett mountain . the new wind turbine will be visible from the summit look in a southwesterly direction at the junction of harrington trail and the base of the existing fire / communication tower on the summit . the wind farm be approximately @card@ mile away from this location . as you can see from the photo simulation , the wind turbine be attractive and not overbear in proportion to the view shed . since the wind turbine be visible from this location , pmld propose to install a renewable energy education display / kiosk . a kiosk or static display would explain to visitor to the summit , the town of Princeton ' s renewable energy project and the associate environmental benefit of the wind turbine visible from this location . topographic profile in addition to the photo simulation find in section @card@ , pmld create the follow profile of the topography between each historic property and the wind farm . each topographic profile confirm whether or not the wind farm be visible form the various historic location in princeton . topographic profile from bullock ski lodge to wind farm topographic profile from dcr visitor center to wind farm topographic profile from dcr superintendent ' s house to wind farm topographic profile from scenic overlook ledge to wind farm topographic profile from wachusett mountain summit to wind farm topographic profile from edward goodnow house to wind farm topographic profile from princeton center historic center to wind farm topographic profile from fernside to wind farm topographic profile from east princeton historic district to wind farm as illustrate in topographic profile @card@ and @card@ , the wind turbine will be visible at two historic location in princeton . however , it be important to note that the existing turbine be visible from these historic location as well . pmld believe there be no additional impact from install the two new turbine at our existing wind farm . photo simulation of the wind farm from these location be find in section @ord@ as note earlier , pmld propose to install energy kiosk at these location in order to help mitigate the visual impact of Princeton ' s wind farm . section @card@ : benefit to the general public and wachusett mountain state reservation pmld prefer to utilize the existing access road along stage coach trail . the existing access road be own and control by the department of conservation and recreation ( dcr ) . when the original wind be install in @card@ , dcr allow pmld to utilize stage coach trail as an alternative to pmld develop a second road to the same site along pmld ' s legal right of way . pmld will request dcr to grant access along stage coach trail through the mepa process . pmld will file an enf describe the two option for access to the site . if dcr allow pmld continued access along stage coach trail , pmld will begin the legal process of exchange its legal right-of-way with a new right-of-way along stage coach trail . pmld believe the follow benefit justify continued access along stage coach trail and the eventual exchange of legal right-of-ways . pmld ' s right of way ( row ) will not be develop : pmld will not develop its legal row and remove approximately @card@ acre of mature tree through dcr ' S property . in exchange , dcr would allow pmld to continue use the existing access road pmld have utilize for the last @card@ year . the condition of the exit access road be adequate , need only minor improvement such as gravel and compaction . there be significantly more environmental impact to the reservation , if pmld construct be legal right of way to the wind farm . pmld will give dcr , @card@ acre of land not develop at the wind farm : dcr ' s harrington trail currently follow a path through the town of Princeton ' S @card@ acre wind farm . pmld will request the town of princeton to give dcr , ownership and control , of the land surround that portion of harrington trail on town own property . pmld would also request the town of princeton to give dcr , ownership and control of any unused portion of the wind farm so that it could not be develop in the future . this could potentially add approximately @card@ acre of land to the reservation at no cost to dcr . electric service to mountain road visitor center : pmld will design and install an underground electrical service to the new mountain road visitor center . the design and installation will include approximately @card@ ' of conduct , underground conductor , and connection to pmld ' s electrical distribution system at no cost to dcr . renewable energy static display and kiosk : pmld will provide and install renewable energy education kiosk at the new visitor ' S center or existing visitor facility on mountain road value at approximately $ @card@ , @card@ . the material would include information relate to renewable energy production and energy efficiency . pmld will also provide and install a static display on stage coach trail and on the summit of wachusett mountain to highlight information relate to the wind farm for hiker and visitor to the reservation . solar energy demonstration project : pmld will provide and install a 300w , solar panel system , to demonstrate the late technology in solar energy technology at the existing or new visitor ' s center on mountain road . this solar energy demonstration project would reduce the wachusett mountain visitor center ' s actual energy consumption , save money , and act as a renewable energy educational tool for the public . solar panel and renewable energy display would also demonstrate dcr ' s commitment to both protect the natural environment and utilize renewable energy . overhead electrical service to mountain summit : the overhead electric service to the summit of wachusett mountain be approximately fifty year old and include @card@ utility pole and over one mile of electrical conductor . dcr , as the owner , be responsible for all preventative and corrective maintenance to this electric service . pmld have perform preventative and corrective maintenance on this electric service at no cost to dcr over the last @card@ year . the annual cost be approximately $ @card@ , @card@ - $ @card@ , @card@ depend on how much damage be cause by weather related event . pmld will continue to provide preventative and corrective maintenance at no cost to dcr and assist dcr be design a new electric service to the summit . new access road to summit : pmld understand that a new access road will be construct to the summit of wachusett mountain . this project should incorporate a new underground electrical service to the summit , to replace dcr ' S exist overhead electric service mention above . pmld will design and connect the new underground service for dcr at no cost . the approximate value of these service be $ @card@ , @card@ - $ @card@ , @card@ . renewable energy : as a customer of pmld , the wachusett mountain visitor center will receive a large percentage of its electricity from renewable resource . the new wind farm and existing hydroelectric power supply would increase the percentage of renewable energy deliver to the wachusett mountain visitor center to approximately @card@ % at no additional cost or premium . dcr could take advantage of this fact and actively market its commitment to protect the environment by utilize a significant amount of reliable and cost effective renewable energy . educational seminar and tour : pmld will continue to provide personnel and material resource to help educate visitor to the reservation about wind energy and its associate environmental benefit . since @card@ , pmld have conduct various educational seminar about renewable energy for student , teacher , and reservation visitor . pmld have also participate in nature hike with dcr staff to educate visitor about renewable energy as they hike to the summit wachusett mountain . pmld believe that our new wind farm will draw more visitor to the reservation and lead to a great awareness of renewable energy and its place in our environment . road improvement to stage coach trail : pmld will maintain the access road at no cost to dcr and will repair the culvert at the beginning of stage coach trail . pmld ' S maintenance will include culvert , water dam , and periodic grade of the access road to ensure the road be maintain in an esthetically pleasing manner . signage : pmld will provide and install appropriate signage around the wind farm to instruct visitor as to the various safety consideration while hike through and around the area of the wind farm . stage coach trail parking area : in order to improve access to the reservation and enhance vehicle / pedestrian safety , pmld propose to install a parking area on dcr own land at the intersection of stage coach trail and westminster road . a new , crushed stone parking area could accommodate up to @card@ vehicle . vehicle must currently park along the side of westminster road , because of the lack of any dedicated visitor parking space for visitor to the reservation .
