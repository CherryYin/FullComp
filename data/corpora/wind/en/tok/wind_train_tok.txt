project title

gone with the wind turbine
abstract objectives/goals the purpose of this project was to find out which wind turbine design generates the most electricity . the variables i chose were a two-bladed horizontal axis wind turbine ( hawt ) and a four-bladed hawt . methods/materials i built the wind turbine blades out of balsa wood and used a small 3 volt hobby motor for the generator . i also soldered a network of 5 switches and 5 ohm resistors so that as more resistors were switched on , the resistance decreased , which increased the electrical load on the generator . a gearbox was also added to increase the speed of the motor , since the motor was designed to spin at 11,000 rpm . the wind turbine was tested in a wind tunnel made of cardboard and powered with a 3 speed household fan . measurements were made using a digital volt meter ( dvm ) . determining electrical power from the measurements was done by using ohm # s law , which states : to find power ( watts ) you divide volts squared by ohms . the variables in this test were : 2 blade designs ( 2 and 4 ) , 3 wind speeds , 3 gear ratios , and 6 resistor loads , for a total number of measurements of 108. results the two bladed turbine produced more electricity than the four bladed one with a gear ratio of 1:1 and 4:1 because it was lighter . but it could not start up with a gear ratio of 16:1 at wind speeds of 12 and 18 mph because it did not have enough torque to rotate . the four bladed turbine produced more electricity than the two bladed one with a gear ratio of 16:1 because it had more torque than the two bladed turbine . conclusions/discussion according to my results , my hypothesis was both correct and incorrect . different turbines work better than others in different conditions . this is probably why wind turbine manufacturers are always coming up with new wind turbine designs for different conditions . i also concluded that the power curves for wind power and electrical power have the same shape for the wind speeds that i tested .

summary statement the purpose of this project was to find out whether a two-bladed horizontal axis wind turbine ( hawt ) or a four-bladed hawt wind turbine design generates the most electricity . help received mother helped edit and type report . father helped finance the project and supervised the research .

introduction

wind energy is the world ’ s fastest growing renewable energy source . the average annual growth rate of wind turbine installation is around 30 % during last 10 years [ 1 , 2 ] . at the end of 2006 , the global wind electricitygenerating capacity increased to 74 223 mw from 59 091 mw in 2005 ( fig . 1 ) . by the end of 2020 , it is expected that this figure will have increased to well over 1 260 000 mw , which will be sufficient for 12 % of the world ’ s electricity consumption [ 3 , 4 ] . fig . 2 depicts the total wind power installed capacity for some countries from 1985 to 2006. the countries with the highest total installed capacity are germany ( 20 622 mw ) , spain ( 11 615 mw ) , the usa ( 11 603 mw ) , india ( 6270 mw ) and denmark ( 3136 mw ) . according to global wind energy council report [ 2 ] , europe continues to lead the market with 48 545 mw of installed capacity at the end of 2006 , representing 65 % of the global total , and the european wind energy association has set a target of satisfying 23 % european electricity needs with wind energy by 2030. it is clear that the

global market for the electrical power produced by wind turbine generators has been increasing steadily , which directly pushes the wind technology into a more competitive area . the development of modern wind power conversion technology has been going on since 1970s , and the rapid development has been seen from 1990s . various wind turbine concepts have been developed and different wind generators have been built . three types of typical generator systems for large wind turbines exist [ 3 , 5 – 7 ] . the first type is a fixed-speed wind turbine system using a multi-stage gearbox and a standard squirrel-cage induction generator ( scig ) , directly connected to the grid . the second type is a variable speed wind turbine system with a multi-stage gearbox and a doubly fed induction generator ( dfig ) , where the power electronic converter feeding the rotor winding has a power rating of 30 % of the generator capacity ; the stator winding of the dfig is directly connected to the grid . the third type is also a variable speed wind turbine , but it is a gearless wind

developments of wind generator systems are presented , and suitable comparison criteria of different wind generator systems are also discussed .

2 wind turbine concepts and generator types
referring to the rotation speed , wind turbine concepts can be classified into fixed speed , limited variable speed and variable speed . for variable speed wind turbines , based on the rating of power converter related to the generator capacity , they can be further classified into wind generator systems with a partialscale and a full-scale power electronic converter . in addition , considering the drive train components , the wind turbine concepts can be classified into geareddrive and direct-drive wind turbines . in geared-drive wind turbines , one conventional configuration is a multiple-stage gear with a high-speed generator ; the other one is the multibrid concept which has a singlestage gear and a low-speed generator [ 8 ] . in this section , according to contemporary wind turbine concepts , the basic configurations and characteristics of different wind generator systems are described .

figure 1 world cumulative wind power installed capacity ( 1980 – 2006 )

turbine system with a direct-drive generator , normally a low-speed high-torque synchronous generator and a full-scale power electronic converter are used . additionally , a variety of innovative concepts of wind turbines appear , for example , an interesting alternative may be a mixed solution with a gearbox and a smaller low speed permanent magnet synchronous generator ( pmsg ) [ 7–9 ] , because direct-drive wind generators are becoming larger and even more expensive for increasing power levels and decreasing rotor speeds . the main aim of this paper is to provide an overall perspective on various types of existing wind generator systems and possible generator configurations , and some comparisons of different wind generator systems in literatures and in the market . the paper is organised as follows . first , it gives an overview of various wind turbine concepts with respect to both their control ability and drive train types , including possible types of direct-drive permanent magnet ( pm ) machines . then the quantitative comparisons of different wind generator systems based on some available technical data from literatures are presented , including their market penetration and share . finally , the trends and

2.1 fixed speed concept
the fixed speed wind generator systems have been used with a multiple-stage gearbox and a scig directly connected to the grid through a transformer as illustrated in fig . 3. because the scig operates only in a narrow range around the synchronous speed , the wind turbine equipped with this type of generator is often called the fixed-speed wind generator system . this is the conventional concept applied by many danish wind turbine manufacturers during the 1980s and 1990s , that is , an upwind , stall-regulated , three-bladed wind turbine concept using an scig [ 3 , 10 ] , so that it is also referred to as ‘ danish concept ’ . since the scig always draws reactive power from the grid , during the 1980s this concept was extended with a capacitor bank for reactive power compensation . smoother grid connection was also achieved by incorporating a soft-starter . furthermore , a pole-changeable scig has been used , which leads two rotation speeds . some manufacturers , such as micon ( currently merged into vestas ) , bonus ( currently siemens ) , made and nordex , have products based on this concept .

the well-known advantages of scig are it is robust , easy and relatively cheap for mass production . in addition , it enables stall-regulated machines to operate at a constant speed when it is connected to a large grid , which provides a stable control frequency . although the stall control method is usually used in combination with the fixed speed scig for power control , the active stall control or pitch control have also been applied . the disadvantages of scig for the fixed speed wind turbine concept are as follows [ 3 , 10 – 15 ] . † the speed is not controllable and variable only over a very narrow range , in which only speeds higher than the synchronous speed are possible for generator operation . because a higher slip means a higher dissipation of electrical energy in the rotor bars , for example , the slip is normally not higher than 1 % for 1 mw wind turbine [ 11 ] . additionally , the fixed speed concept means that wind speed fluctuations are directly translated into electromechanical torque variations , this causes high mechanical and fatigue stresses on the system ( turbine blades , gearbox and generator ) and may result in swing oscillations between turbine and generator shaft . also the periodical torque dips because of the tower shadow and shear effect are not damped by speed variations and result in higher flicker . furthermore , the turbine speed can not be adjusted with the wind speed to optimise the aerodynamic efficiency . although a pole-changeable scig has been used in some commercial wind turbines , it does not provide continuous speed variations . † a three-stage gearbox in the drive train is necessary for this wind turbine concept . gearboxes represent a large mass in the nacelle , and also a large fraction of the investment costs . † it is necessary to obtain the excitation current from the stator terminal of scig . this makes it impossible to support grid voltage control . in most cases , capacitors are connected in parallel to the generator to compensate for the reactive power consumption .

the stator of wrig is directly connected to the grid , whereas the rotor winding is connected in series with a controlled resistor . variable-speed operation can be achieved by controlling the energy extracted from the wrig rotor ; however , this power must be dissipated in the external resistor . with the increase in variable speed range , a higher slip means a high power extracted by the rotor , and the lower generator efficiency , so that the rating of the resistor must also be higher . therefore the dynamic speed control range depends on the size of the variable rotor resistance , and the energy extracted from the external resistor is also dumped as heat loss in the controllable rotor resistance . a typical limited variable speed range is less than 10 % above the synchronous speed [ 3 , 10 , 12 ] . additionally , the slip rings may be avoided , for example , the wind turbine manufacturer vestas built the power converter and resistor on the rotor , the control signals are transmitted to the rotating electronics by an optical coupling . furthermore , reactive power compensation and a soft-starter are also required for this concept .

2.3 variable speed concept with a partial-scale power converter
this configuration is known as the dfig concept , which corresponds to a variable speed wind turbine with a wrig and a partial-scale power converter on the rotor circuit , as illustrated in fig . 5. the stator is directly connected to the grid , whereas the rotor is connected through a power electronic converter . the power converter controls the rotor frequency and thus the rotor speed . this concept supports a wide speed range operation , depending on the size of the frequency converter . typically , the variable speed range is +30 % around the synchronous speed [ 3 , 10 – 13 ] . the rating of the power electronic converter is only 25 –30 % of the generator capacity , which makes this concept attractive and popular from an economic point of view . there are many manufacturers , such as vestas , gamesa , repower ,

2.2 limited variable speed concept
the limited variable speed concept with a multiple-stage gearbox is also known as the optislip concept , which has been applied by the danish manufacturer vestas since the mid 1990s [ 10 , 11 ] . this wind turbine concept uses a wound rotor induction generator ( wrig ) with variable rotor resistance by means of a power electronic converter and the pitch control method , as shown in fig . 4. presently , manufacturers of vestas and suzlon have products based on this concept .

nordex , using this concept in the market . the largest capacity for the commercial wind turbine product with dfig has been up to 5 mw from repower . compared with the optislip concept , the rotor energy , instead of being dissipated , can be fed into the grid by the power electronic converter . moreover , the power converter system can perform reactive power compensation and smooth grid connection , for example , the grid-side converter can control its reactive power , independently of the generator operation ; this allows the performance of voltage support towards the grid . however , the dfig system has the following disadvantages [ 3 , 10 , 12 , 15 ] . † a multi-stage gearbox is still necessary in the drive train because the speed range for dfig is far from a common turbine speed of 10 – 25 rpm . a gearbox is inevitable to have some drawbacks , such as heat dissipation from friction , regular maintenance and audible noise . † the slip ring is used to transfer the rotor power by means of a partial-scale converter , which requires a regular maintenance , and maybe result in machine failures and electrical losses . † under grid fault conditions , on the one hand , large stator currents result in large rotor currents , so that the power electronic converter needs to be protected from destroy ; on the other hand , large stator peak currents may cause high torque loads on the drive train of wind turbines . † according to grid connection requirements for wind turbines , in case of grid disturbances , a ride-through capability of dfig is also required , so that the corresponding control strategies may be complicated . flux density limitations , a higher torque also requires a larger machine ’ s volume , so that the torque density could not be further significantly increased . to increase the efficiency , to reduce the weight of the active parts and to keep the end winding losses small , direct-drive generators are usually designed with a large diameter and small pole pitch [ 16 , 17 ] . in addition , the advantages of direct-drive wind turbines are the simplified drive train , the high overall efficiency , the high reliability and availability by omitting the gearbox . compared with the variable speed concept with a partial-scale power converter , the full-scale power converter can perform smooth grid connection over the entire speed range . however , it has a higher cost and a higher power loss in the power electronics , since all the generated power has to pass through the power converter . basically , types of direct-drive generators used in the market can be classified into the electrically excited synchronous generator ( eesg ) and the pmsg . the main features of eesg are described in section 2.4.1. the features of different topologies of pmsg are presented in section 2.4.2 . 2.4.1 electrically excited synchronous generator : the eesg is usually built with a rotor carrying the field system provided with a dc excitation . the stator carries a three-phase winding quite similar to that of the induction machine . the rotor may have salient poles or may be cylindrical . salient poles are more usual in low-speed machines and may be the most useful version for application to direct-drive wind turbines . a grid connection scheme of eesg for direct-drive wind turbines is shown in fig . 6. the amplitude and frequency of the voltage can be fully controlled by the power electronic at the generator side , so that the generator speed is fully controllable over a wide range , even to very low speeds . in addition , the eesg has the opportunities of controlling the flux for a minimised loss in different power ranges , because the excitation current can be controlled by means of the power converter in the rotor side . moreover , it does not require the use of pms , which would represent a large fraction of the generator costs , and might suffer from performance loss in harsh atmospheric conditions . therefore it is the mostly used direct-drive generator type in the

2.4 variable speed direct-drive concept with a full-scale power converter
this configuration may correspond to a variable speed wind turbine with a direct-drive generator connected to the grid through a full-scale power converter . the most important difference between geared drive wind turbines and direct-drive types is the generator rotor speed . the direct-drive generator rotates at a low speed , because the generator rotor is directly connected on the hub of the turbine rotor . to deliver a certain power , the lower speed makes it necessary to produce a higher torque . a higher torque means a larger size of the generator . therefore for direct-drive generators , the low speed and high torque operation require multi-poles , which demand a larger diameter for implementation of large number of poles with a reasonable pitch . moreover , for a larger direct-drive generator , considering on the current loading and gap

current market [ 14 ] . the typical manufacturer is enercon , the largest capacity of the direct-drive eesg has been up to 4.5 mw ( e-112 ) . including the disadvantages of direct-drive wind turbines compared with geared-drive wind turbines , some disadvantages of direct-drive eesg systems can be summarised as follows [ 16 , 17 ] . † in order to arrange space for excitation windings and pole shoes , the pole pitch has to be large enough for the large diameter-specific design , so a larger number of parts and windings probably make it a heavy weight and expensive solution . † it is necessary to excite the rotor winding with dc , using slip rings and brushes , or brushless exciter , employing a rotating rectifier , and the field losses are inevitable . 2.4.2 pm synchronous generator : the scheme of a grid-connected pmsg for direct-drive wind turbines is shown in fig . 7. the advantages of pm machines over electrically excited machines can be summarised as follows according to literatures [ 16 – 23 ] : † higher efficiency and energy yield , † no additional power supply for the magnet field excitation , † improvement in the thermal characteristics of the pm machine due to the absence of the field losses , † higher reliability due to the absence of mechanical components such as slip rings , † lighter and therefore higher power to weight ratio . however , pm machines have some disadvantages , which can be summarised as follows : † high cost of pm material , † difficulties to handle in manufacture , † demagnetisation of pm at high temperature . in recent years , the use of pms is more attractive than before , because the performance of pms is improving and the cost of pm is decreasing . the trends make pm machines with a full-scale power converter more attractive for direct-drive wind turbines . currently , zephyros ( currently harakosan ) and mitsubishi are using this concept in 2 mw wind turbines in the market . pm machines are not standard off-the-shelf machines and they allow a great deal of flexibility in their geometry , so that various topologies may be used . pm machines can be classified into the following types : radial flux , the axial flux and the transversal flux , based on the direction of flux penetration . some basic structures and features from literatures [ 16–28 ] are briefly described and summarised as follows . radial-flux pm machines : the pms of radial-flux machines are radically oriented . when using radial-flux pm ( rfpm ) machines for direct-drive wind turbines , the wind generator system can operate with a good performance over a wide range of speeds . in manufacture , the simple way of constructing the machine with high number of poles is gluing pms on the rotor surface . in rfpm machines , the length of the machine and the air-gap diameter can be chosen independently . if necessary , the radial-flux machine can be made with a small diameter by using a long machine . rfpm machines have advantages as a better torque density than the eesg , so that some types of rfpm machines have been discussed in a number of literatures . two types of rfpm machines , the slotted surfacemounted pm machine and the slotted fluxconcentrating pm machine , have been mostly discussed in references [ 16 , 23 ] . one rotor design with surfacemounted magnets and one rotor design with flux concentration are shown in fig . 8. compared with the flux concentration , magnets on the rotor surface have to have a remanent flux density higher than the required air-gap flux density , this leads to a very simple rotor design with a low weight . references [ 16 , 17 , 20 , 27 ] discussed rfpm machines with surface-mounted magnet , which seems to be a good choice for the design of large-scale direct-drive wind turbines [ 16 , 17 ] . rfpm machines with flux concentration have been discussed and compared with surface-mounted rfpm machines in [ 26 , 29 ] . in addition , chen et al . [ 20 ] have presented an outer rotor design for this type of generator in stand-alone applications . several advantages of the outer-rotor rfpm machine were identified in this reference ; for example , compared with the inner-rotor construction , the multi-pole structure can be easily accommodated because of the enlarged periphery of the outer-rotor

drum , and therefore the total length of the magnetic path can be reduced . as the rotor is directly exposed to the wind , the cooling condition can be improved for the magnets so that the resistance to temperature demagnetisation is enhanced . moreover , chen et al . [ 19 ] have also made a comparison of different pm wind generator topologies . in addition , hanitsch and korouji [ 21 ] have designed a rare-earth rfpm wind-energy generator with a new topology , which is constructed from two rotors and one stator with short end windings . it can improve the performance of the machine by reducing the weight , increasing the efficiency and reducing the cost of active materials . axial-flux pm machines : the axial-flux pm ( afpm ) machine is a machine producing magnetic flux in the axial direction , instead of the radial direction . two types of afpm machines , the slotless and slotted surface-mounted pm , have been mostly discussed in references . compared with rfpm machines , the advantages of afpm machines can be summarised as follows : † simple winding , † low cogging torque and noise ( in slotless machine ) , † short axial length , † higher torque/volume ratio . however , the disadvantages of afpm machines in comparison with rfpm machines are as follows [ 23 , 27 ] : † lower torque/mass ratio † larger outer diameter , large amount of pm and structural instability ( in slotless machine ) † difficulty to maintain air gap in large diameter ( in slotted machine ) † difficulty in production of stator core ( in slotted machine ) .
128 & the institution of engineering and technology 2008

the possibility and potential of afpm machines for large-scale direct-drive wind turbines have been discussed , and some different structures of afpm machines with surface-mounted pm have also been presented in some references [ 19 , 22 , 26 ] . the slotless single stator double rotor is a typical structure of slotless afpm machines , which is often referred to as a torus machine , as shown in fig . 9 [ 22 ] . the two rotor discs are made of mild steel and have surface-mounted pm to produce an axially directed magnetic field in the machine air gaps . the machine stator comprises a slotless toroidally wound strip-iron core that carries a three-phase winding in a toroidal fashion by means of concentrated coils . the slotless , toroidal-stator afpm generator has been also discussed with several advantages , such as the lightness , the compactness , the short axial length , the suitable integration with the engine and others by spooner and chalmers [ 30 ] and wu et al . [ 31 , 32 ] , the machine ’ s short axial length tends to give it a high power to weight ratio . parviainen [ 26 ] has presented an analytical method to perform the preliminary design of a surface-mounted , low-speed , slotted afpm machine with one-rotor two-stator configuration , as shown in fig . 10. the performance and construction between the low-speed radial flux and axial flux pm machine were also compared in the power range from 10 to 500 kw at 150 – 600 rpm [ 26 ] . moreover , five different topologies of afpm machines , a double-stator slotted type , a double-rotor slotted type , a single-sided afpm with stator balance ,

a single-sided afpm with rotor balance and a slotless single-stator double-rotor ( torus machine ) , have been investigated and compared with rfpm machines by chen et al . [ 19 ] . according to [ 19 ] , the two-sided afpm machine is superior to the one-sided afpm machine ; however , one-sided constructions use less copper and have a lower conduction loss . the torus construction is simple ; however , it requires more magnet weight because of the presence of the additional air gap for accommodating stator windings . as the power rating increases , both the air gap and air gap reluctance become larger , so that this construction is more suitable for low power rating wind generators . in addition , the potential application of soft magnetic composite ( smc ) material applied to the low speed , direct-drive axial flux pm wind generator was also discussed by chen et al . comparative design studies were conducted on different configuration pm generators with both lamination core and smc core [ 33 ] . transversal-flux pm machines : the transverse-flux principle means that the path of the magnetic flux is perpendicular to the direction of the rotor rotation . there are also some different rotor structures for this technology , such as the rotor with single-sided surface magnets with single-sided flux concentration and with double-sided flux concentration . fig . 11 shows the configuration of a surface-mounted transverse-flux pmsg [ 12 ] . a transverse flux pm ( tfpm ) machine is a synchronous machine in nature , and it will function in a manner similar to any other pmsg in principle . compared with longitudinal machines , tfpm machines have some advantages , such as higher force density , considerably low copper losses and simple winding . however , the force density of tfpm machines with large air gap may be a little high or even low depending on the outside diameter [ 16 , 23 ] . the construction of tfpm machines is much more complicated than longitudinal flux machines . compared with rfpm or afpm machines , a major difference is that tfpm machines allow an increase in the space for the simple windings without decreasing the available space for the main flux , and so that the

machines have very low copper losses . tfpm machines can also be made with a very small pole pitch ; however , the electromagnetic structure is much more complicated . tfpm machines have also the low power factor , which leads to an increase in the necessary rating of the power electronic converter . tfpm machines have been discussed in a number of references [ 16 , 23 , 27 , 34 ] . references [ 16 , 27 ] show that the weight of a 55 kw tfpm machine is about half of the total weight of an asynchronous machine with a gearbox . tfpm machines seem to be suitable for direct-drive applications because of the high specific torque , although special methods of manufacturing and assembly are required [ 23 ] . harris et al . [ 34 ] compared the advantages and disadvantages of three different tfpm machine topologies , which include a single-sided surface-mounted pm machine , a single-sided surface-mounted pm machine with stator bridges and a double-sided flux concentrating pm machine [ 34 ] .

2.5 variable speed single-stage geared concept with a full-scale power converter
in this scheme , a variable speed pitch control wind turbine is connected to a single-stage planetary gearbox that increases the speed by a factor of roughly 10 and a low-speed permanent-magnet generator . the grid connection scheme of this concept is shown in fig . 12. this concept , which was introduced as the multibrid , has gained the attention because it has the advantages of a higher speed than the direct-drive concept and a lower mechanical component than the multiple-stage gearbox concept . wind turbine

manufacturers , such as multibrid and winwind , have products based on this concept in the market . furthermore , the clipper system , a single-stage gearbox with multiple output shafts that drive a number of medium speed , medium-torque pmsgs , has also been introduced . each of the generator outputs is connected to a dedicated power electronic converter . currently , the clipper system concept is used in the market with the rated power of 2.5 mw ( four 660 kw pmsgs ) [ 35 ]

2.6 variable speed multiple-stage geared concept with a full-scale power converter
2.6.1 pmsg system : a pmsg system with a multiplegearbox is used in order to reduce the generator ’ s volume and improve the generator efficiency in variable speed wind turbine concepts with a full-scale power converter . fig . 13 shows the grid connection scheme of this concept . compared with the dfig system , this wind generator system has the following advantages . † the generator has a better efficiency . † the generator can be brushless . † the grid-fault ride-through capability is less complex . and the following disadvantages : † larger , more expensive converter ( 100 % of rated power instead of 30 % ) , † the losses in the converter are higher because all powers are processed by the power electronic converter . in the market , this configuration has been used in ge multi-megawatt series . 2.6.2 scig system : in order to fulfill the variable speed operation with an scig , an alternative generator system that might replace the capacitor bank and soft-starter of ‘ danish concept ’ is a variable speed multiple-stage geared scig with a full-scale converter , as shown in fig . 14 .

compared with ‘ danish concept ’ as mentioned above , this concept has advantages of the flexible control with a full-scale power , such as variable speed operation , better performances of reactive power compensation and smooth grid connection . however , its disadvantage is the high cost and losses of the fullscale converter , the efficiency of the total system ( gearbox induction generator and converter ) may be low . presently , siemens is using this concept with the rated power of 3.6 mw ( bonus 107 ) in the market , and the generator speed range is designed to be 595– 1547 rpm . the decreasing cost of power electronics ( roughly a factor of 10 over the past 10 years ) and the absence of brushes may make variable speed multiple-stage geared concepts ( both pmsg and scig as mentioned above ) more attractive .

many other types of wind generators are also mentioned in literatures , such as linear induction generators [ 36 ] , switched reluctance generators [ 37 ] , claw-pole generators [ 36 ] ; brushless dfigs ( bdfigs ) [ 36 , 38 ] . among them , the bdfig may be one of the most innovative types . a grid connection scheme of the wind turbine concept with bdfig is shown in fig . 15. for this configuration , the output of the induction generator is directly connected to the grid , and thus the generator output frequency must be equal to the grid frequency . the bdfig does not need the slip ring ; however , it requires double stator windings , with different number of poles in both stator layers . the second stator layer generally has lower copper mass , because only a part of the generator nominal current flows in the second winding . this second stator winding is connected through a power electronic

converter , which is rated at only a fraction of the wind turbine rating . the bdfig system has the capability of realising the variable speed operation and independently controls the stator active and reactive power . compared with the dfig system , this concept does not require slip rings ; however , the machine operation principle and its assembly are relatively complex . concept , or 10– 15 % more than the fixed single-speed concept . some comparisons between the direct-drive pmsg and the geared-drive traditional scig of commercial 500 kw wind turbines have been performed by annon . [ 39 ] . the detailed results are given in table 2. as it can be observed in table 2 , the annual energy production of the direct-drive pmsg is higher than that of the geared-drive conventional scig . although the wind turbine rotor diameter of the direct-drive pmsg is greater than that of the geared-drive scig , the total weight of the rotor and nacelle is lower ; it seems realistic to conclude that the total weight of the two alternative systems will be of the same order . a 1.5 mw direct-drive wind turbine system with eesg has been compared with the dfig system with a multi-stage gearbox by siegfriedsen and bohmeke [ 8 ] ¨ and bohmeke et al . [ 40 ] . they concluded that the ¨ direct-drive system would be more expensive and heavier than the dfig wind turbines . in addition , the comparison between the direct-drive pmsg and eesg shows the cost for active material of pmsg is lower . this is mainly due to the reduced pole pitch of pmsg , and the increased number of poles can be set for a given diameter [ 16 , 17 , 23 ] . recently , polinder et al . [ 9 ] have also presented a detailed comparison of five 3 mw different generator systems for variable speed wind turbine concepts , which are a dfig system with three-stage gearbox ( dfig 3g ) , a directtable 2 main comparison of two commercial 500 kw wind turbines with the direct-drive pmsg and the fixed-speed scig system [ 39 ] generators concepts speed of wind turbines rotor , rpm speed of generator rotor , rpm annual energy production at mean wind speed , kwh 5 m/s 10 m/s wind turbine rotor diameter , m wind turbine weight , ton rotor , including hub nacelle 1.2 3 2 6 rotor þ nacelle tower 90.7 88.4 91.6 90.0 total 20.5 5.6 26.1 34.0 60.1 9.2 19.9 29.0 27.8 56.9 615 2350 40.3 528 2189 38.2 pmsg 18– 38 scig 30

3 comparison of different wind generator systems
in this section , a survey of quantitative comparisons of different wind generator systems is performed , which includes the performance comparison and the market penetration share .

3.1 performance comparison of different wind generator systems
some comparisons of different wind generator system have been conducted by some researchers [ 8–13 , 17 , 19 , 24 , 26 , 39 –41 ] . grauers [ 17 ] has presented a quantitative comparison between the variable speed direct-drive concept of the rfpm generator system with a forced-commutated rectifier and the commercial product of the fixed-speed concept with scig . some main parameter comparisons for two rated power levels of 500 kw and 3 mw are respectively , shown in table 1. according to [ 17 ] , the outer diameter of the directdrive pmsg is almost two times of the conventional geared-drive scig ; however , the total length is two to three times shorter than that of scig system including the length of high-speed shaft . additionly , the direct-drive pmsg system has its average efficiency of 2.3 % and 1.6 % higher than the fixed speed scig system at the 500 kw and 3 mw rated power , respectively . because of the variable speed operation , the direct-drive pmsg system can produce 5 –10 % more energy than the fixed two-speed

drive eesg system ( eesg dd ) , a pm excited directdrive synchronous generator system ( pmsg dd ) , a pm excited synchronous generator system with single-stage gearbox ( pmsg 1g ) and a dfig system with single-stage gearbox ( dfig 1g ) . approximated designs of the five different generator systems have been presented for a given wind turbine . main dimensions and performances of the comparison are presented in table 3. based on the survey , the following conclusions can be summarised . † from the aspects of size and weight , the outer diameter of the direct-drive wind generator is usually larger than the geared-drive generator , but the total length is shorter . considering the parts of wind turbine blade , the total weight of wind turbine systems may have no big difference between a threestage geared-drive configuration and a direct-drive pmsg solution . † dfig 3g is the lightest and low-cost solution with standard components according to [ 9 ] . † for direct-drive wind turbine topologies , pmsg dd has the highest energy yield , eesg dd appears to be the heaviest and the most expensive solution . † a solution with a one-stage gearbox together with a multi-pole generator may be an interesting solution . for example , dfig 1g seems to be the most interesting choice because of the highest annual energy yield divided by cost and the lowest generator system cost [ 9 ] . pmsg 1g has a better performance than pmsg dd with respect to the energy yield per cost .

3.2 market penetration of different wind turbine concepts
various types of wind turbines have been on the market with different power levels . in order to present the trends of different wind generator systems on the market , table 4 shows some wind turbines with a rated power over 2 mw from different manufactures , such as vestas , gamesa , ge wind , repower , nordex and so on , where the wind turbine concept , generator type , rated power and turbine rotor speed are obtained from manufacturers ’ websites [ 42– 54 ] . as it can be seen , most manufactures are using geared-drive wind turbine concepts . the wind turbines produced by vestas , gamesa , ge wind , repower , nordex and ecotecnia are using dfig with a multiple-stage gearbox . according to this survey , it is clear that the wind market is still dominated by dfig with a multiple-stage gearbox , and the mostly used generator type is still the induction generator

dominant concept at the end of 2004. market penetration of the sg concept ( eesg or pmsg ) has altered little over 10 years , with no such dramatic changes as observed for scig , wrig and dfig . there is , however , a slight increasing trend over the last 3 years ( 2002 – 2004 ) . during the 10 years , the direct-drive sg ( eesg and pmsg ) has ranked third or fourth ( fig . 16 ) .

4 trends discussion
the fault ride-through capability is required to avoid significant loss of wind power production in the event of grid faults . this means wind turbines should stay connected and contribute to the grid in case of a disturbance such as a voltage dip . they should immediately supply active and reactive power for frequency and voltage recovery after the fault has been cleared . as an example , the requirements concerning immunity to voltage dips as prescribed by e.on netz , a grid operator in northern germany , is shown in fig . 17. only when the grid voltage drops below the curve ( in duration or voltage level ) , the turbine is allowed to be disconnected . when the voltage is in the shaded area , the turbine should also supply reactive power to the grid in order to support grid restoration [ 11 ] .

with rapid development of wind turbine technologies , future trends in the wind turbine industry will probably be focused on the gradual improvement of already known technologies , which can be summarised as follows [ 3 , 15 , 56 , 57 ] . † the power level of a single wind turbine will continue to increase , because this reduces the cost of placing wind turbines , especially for offshore wind farms . † offshore wind energy is more attractive , because of higher wind speed and more space than on shore wind energy . † an increasing trend is to remove dispersed single wind turbine in favour of concentrated wind turbines in large wind farms . † an increasing trend in the penetration of wind power into the power system .

4.2 trends of wind generator systems
according to the survey of different wind generator systems and considering the grid connection requirements on wind turbines , the developing trends of wind generator systems may be summarised as follows . † variable speed concept variable speed operation is very attractive for a number of reasons , including reduced mechanical stress and increased power capture . as mentioned , the market share of the fixed speed concept has decreased slightly , whereas variable speed wind turbine increases . for various variable speed wind turbine concepts , a multiple-stage geared-drive dfig with a partial-scale power converter is still dominant in the current market . compared with other variable speed concepts with a full-scale power converter , the main advantage of this concept is only 30 % of the generated power passing through the power converter , so that it may have substantial cost advantages even with lowcost power electronics in the future . however , from the viewpoint of the fault ride-through capability , the

4.1 grid connection requirements
the penetration of wind power into the power system continues to increase , which implies the situation of the large wind farms is changing from being simple energy sources to having power plant status with grid support characteristics . one major challenge in the present and coming years is the connection and optimised integration of large wind farms into electrical grids [ 3 ] . with increased wind power capacity , transmission system operators ( tsos ) have become concerned about the impact of high levels of wind power generation on power systems . to handle large-scale integration of wind power , tsos have issued grid codes and grid requirements for wind turbines connection and operation . the main issues of grid codes can be summarised as follows [ 3 , 10 , 11 ] : † active power control , † reactive power control , † voltage and frequency control , † power quality , for example , flickers and harmonics , † fault ride-through capability . as mentioned above , the power-control capability and the fault ride-through capability are mainly concerned by some tsos . wind farms are required to behave as conventional power plants in power systems , such as regulating active and reactive power and performing frequency and voltage control . and

dfig system has to endure large peak currents during grid faults , an advanced protection system may be required . on the contrary , variable speed wind turbines with a full-scale power converter may be more effective and less complicated to deal with gridrelated problems . therefore variable speed wind turbine concepts with a full-scale power converter will become more attractive . † direct-drive concept compared with geared-drive wind generator systems , the main advantages of direct-drive wind generator systems are higher overall efficiency , reliability and availability because of omitting the gearbox . although the size of direct-drive generators is usually larger , it may not be a serious disadvantage for the offshore wind energy . † pm excited generator type pm machines are more attractive and superior with higher efficiency and energy yield , higher reliability and power to weight ratio compared with electricityexcited machines . according to the above survey of rfpm , afpm and tfpm machines , rfpm machines with surface-mounted pm may be more suitable for direct-drive pm generator types , because of allowing the simple generator structure , good utilisation of the active materials and also allowing the relatively small diameter in comparison with afpm and trpm machines . in the case of afpm machines , the disadvantages as described in section 2.4.2 , which make the machine cost increase and manufacturing difficult , must be solved or improved significantly . although tfpm machines have some advantages , such as high-force density and simple winding with low copper losses , the disadvantages , such as low-force density in large air gap , complicated construction in manufacturing and low power factor may be obvious . however , tfpm still have potential to be used as a direct-drive pm generator with new topology design , since the machines are more flexible for new topologies . considering the performance of pms is improving and the cost of pm is decreasing in recent years , in addition to that the cost of power electronics is decreasing , variable speed direct-drive pm machines with a full-scale power converter become more attractive for offshore wind powers . on the other hand , variable speed concepts with a full-scale power converter and a single- or multiple-stage gearbox drive train may be interesting solutions not only in respect to the annual energy yield per cost but also in respect to the total weight . for example , the market interest of pmsg system with a multiple-stage gearbox or a single-stage gearbox is increasing .
iet renew . power gener . , 2008 , vol . 2 , no . 2 , pp . 123 – 138 doi : 10.1049/iet-rpg:20070044

although the market share in the fixed-speed wind turbine concept has decreased , the market interest in scig based on wind turbines may increase [ 3 ] , if it is demonstrated that high voltage direct current transmission ( hvdc ) technologies-based wind farms consisting of such scig are robust to grid faults . because hvdc can enhance the ability against power system faults , consequently , the generators , which are sensitive to power system faults such as scig , can be used without the problem of ride through power system faults . furthermore , a variable speed scig system with a full-scale power converter has been used for over 3 mw wind turbines , such as bonus 107 model 3.6 mw of siemens wind power . it is clear that power electronics will continue to play an important role in the integration of future large wind farms and design of wind generator systems .

4.3 discussions of comparison criteria
various criteria may be used for comparing different wind generator systems , including the torque density , the cost per torque , the efficiency , the active material weight , the outer diameter , the total length , the total volume , the total generator cost , the annual energy yield , the energy yield per cost , the cost of energy and so on [ 8 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 16 , 17 , 21 , 25 ] . however , with the increase in wind energy penetration into grids and the development of grid connection requirements , overall qualitative comparison criteria considering wind power quality and wind energy yield may be worthwhile for consideration . † current trends of research and development of wind turbine concepts are mostly related to offshore wind energy . the most important difference between the requirements for onshore and offshore wind energy technologies is that it is much more important for offshore turbines to be robust and maintenancefree [ 58 , 59 ] , because it is extremely expensive and difficult and even impossible to do offshore maintenance and reparations under some weather conditions , so that the reliability and availability of large wind generator systems may be more important aspects to be taken into consideration . † with the increasing penetration of wind energy into the grid , some performances related with grid connection requirements may need to be considered in the quantitative comparison . for example , the solution of the flicker problem may yield an extra cost depending on the types of wind generator systems . the fault ride-through capability is also strongly related to the type of the wind generator systems . † some performance indexes referred to wind turbines may have important effects on the annual energy yield of

wind generator systems . for example , the cut-in and cut-off wind speeds need to be taken into consideration for comparison of different wind generator systems , because they can influence the annual energy output and the available operational time of wind turbines , with variation of generator types [ 60 ] . the further development of variable speed wind turbine concepts would be focused on optimised turbines and thus moving towards more cost-effective machines . an overall and practical comparison of different wind generator systems , including techniques , economy , control function , availability and reliability , may require to be further investigated .

of minnesota appendix 2 : how electricity is generated from coal appendix 3 : how electricity is generated from wind reading list : information that is pertinent to mankato executive s ummary two interrelated electrical energy issues concern citizens of mankato : renewable energy options and emissions from existing power plants . as residents and tax payers in mankato , minnesota who take a long-term energy view , we understand the benefits of reducing our consumption of non-renewable energy and of reducing emissions from coal-burning power plants . in our background document we provide the mankato city council members with information that will assist them in making informed choices on the subject of wind power . we understand that city council members must represent the best interests of their constituents , but that they also must take a leadership role on difficult issues , such as energy , that face the citizens of mankato . in our scenarios section we offer five options for the consideration of the city council members . finally , in our appendices , we offer useful wind power resources to the city council members . we are suggesting that the city council of mankato look seriously at increasing the supply of renewable energy in mankato as a way to address our energy problems . we suggest that an energy conservation campaign could be coupled with this wind power program . our team this document was researched and written by the students of two technical communication ( english 271 sections 05 and 07 ) classes at minnesota state university , mankato . the instructor is lee s. tesdell . the original idea came from a fall-semester meeting between the instructor and a student from students for sustainability , mark schiller . these are the students who participated : project management : paul barnett , david jaeger , alex peters , ryan strub , matt welter , and dan winkels writing , editing , and production : emily buss , kristen carpentier ,

josh jenson , sachin rajbhandari , samantha rosevold , bidhya subedi , megan tresidder , and lee windschitl the challenge : e nergy considerations in mankato our current mankato power supply there are three kinds of power suppliers : cooperatives , investor-owned , and municipals . our electrical supply in the mankato area comes from two power suppliers : xcel energy ( formerly northern states power ) which is investor owned , and benco electric which is a cooperative . xcel energy xcel ( http : //www.xcelenergy.com/xlweb/cda/ ) is an investor owned company which generates and transmits power to its customers . xcel operates in eight western and midwestern states with 3.2 million electricity customers and 1.8 million natural gas customers . xcel claims to be the nation ’ s leading purchaser of wind power ( 1,048 megawatts ) . their goal is add another 1,700 megawatts more of wind capacity by the year 2012. source : http : //www.xcelenergy.com benco electric benco is a distribution cooperative . benco buys its power from great river energy , a generation and transmission company ( g & t ) . benco is one of 28 partner distribution cooperatives in minnesota and wisconsin that buy their power from great river energy ( http : //www.greatriverenergy.com/index.html ) . great river , of elk river , mn , generates its 2500 megawatts of power from coal-fired plants in north dakota and lesser amounts from hydropower , a natural gas-fired peaking plant at elk river , mn , wind energy , and purchased power . great river is planning to increase its gas-fired sources , coal-fired sources , and wind power . mankato ’ s population and power needs the current usage by the average minnesota resident is 700 kwh per month ( mpca ) . based on the population of 44,225 ( 2000 census ) this gives us the city ’ s usage per month at 34 gwh in the year 2007. when the cost of $ .08 per kwh ( as charged by xcel energy ) is factored in it adds up pretty quick to $ 80 per mwh or $ 56 per resident per month . the cost of 34 gwh of energy per month is 2.724 million dollars . based on projected growth the city of mankato/north mankato will reach approx 66 , 000 people in the year 2025. using today ’ s price quotes the monthly cost of energy will be 3.7 million dollars . what can we do to prepare for the future ? we can both buy renewable energy and reduce our own use of electrical power . the city council of mankato can provide leadership on both of these points . it is in the long-term interest of the citizens of mankato to both increase our consumption of renewable energy and decrease our use overall of electricity . reducing emissions from coal plants in minnesota about 75 % of our electricity is generated in coal-fired plants . peaking plants use natural gas . nuclear energy is generated at three plants in minnesota . estimates for wind power range from 1-8 % . source : http : //www.pca.state.mn.us/oea/energy/greenpower.cfm ) . while coal is currently the cheapest generating source , it is not renewable and it is not clean . coal-fired plants are able to mitigate the emissions with scrubbers . emissions from coal-fired plants include mercury ( hg ) , sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) , nitrogen oxides ( nox ) , and carbon dioxide ( co2 ) . carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas and therefore contributes to global warming . for emissions by fuel in minnesota , see http : //www.eia.doe.gov/environment.html for information on greenhouse gases , see http : //news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/sci_nat/04/climate_change/html/greenhouse.stm reducing our consumption of non-renewable energy renewable energy sources include wind , solar , and hydroelectric . non-renewables are carbon fuels including petroleum derivatives , coal , and natural gas . we have 100 years of “ easy ” coal left in the world . we have 10 years of natural gas left in the u.s. which is our main source of gas . green power options in mankato there are green power programs at both xcel and benco . for more information about green power , see the u.s. department of energy ’ s “ buying green power ” : http : //www.eere.energy.gov/greenpower/buying/buying_power.shtml ? state=mn benco electric ’ s wellspring program through benco ’ s generating and transmission source , great river energy , consumers can participate in the wellspring program . see : http : //www.greatriverenergy.com/environment/renewables.html xcel ’ s windsource currently xcel energy inc. has a windsource® option for providing energy for families . this process allows customers to buy energy that has been produced on wind farms in minnesota . this energy is provided on a first come , first served basis , since there isn ’ t a sufficient amount of energy created on the wind farms for everyone to use . a total of 19 wind turbines located in pipestone and dodge county in minnesota currently supply the wind energy . since there is a waiting list to be put on in order to receive some of this power , there is obviously a good reason to add more wind turbines to this number . in addition it is projected that if there is no waiting list , more customers would use this method . the rates will start to decrease the more you use the energy , promoting the long-term use of such an environmentally friendly energy source . windsource is available on a first come first serve basis . the cost of windsource energy will be based strictly on how much electricity used during a monthly period . windsource is priced at a charge of $ 0.738 per 100 kwh block as of january 1 , 2007. this is a graph showing how wind source adjustment is calculated . wind energy rate , per 100 kwh block : $ 3.827 less eca** , per 100 kwh block : $ 2.973 less aqir* , per 100 kwh block : $ 0.116 monthly wind energy service adjustment $ 0.738 *the aqir is designed to recover costs associated with air quality improvements ( emissions reductions ) at three denver/boulder power plants . xcel energy completed these projects to reduce emissions voluntarily . the rider became effective january 1 , 2003 , and will be in effect for 15 years . because the aqir is for costs to improve our fossil fuels plants , windsource customers receive an aqir credit for their wind purchase . if they receive all of their electricity from wind , they receive a credit for the entire aqir . the aqir is calculated by multiplying the aqir factor by the amount of kilowatt-hours you used . the aqir fluctuates on an annual basis . **the electric commodity adjustment ( eca ) became effective on january 1 , 2004. the eca recovers ongoing costs associated with purchased energy and generation fuel . all rate schedules are subject to the eca . because the eca is for costs associated with fossil fuel plants , windsource® customers receive an eca credit for their wind purchase . if they receive all of their electricity from wind , they receive a credit for the entire eca . source : http : //www.xcelenergy.com/xlweb/cda/0,3080,1-1-2_735_11612-3320-5_538_969-0,00.html reducing our consumption of electrical power a corner stone of any energy program in mankato should be a savings program whereby citizens and commercial customers would be encouraged to use less electricity . campaigns to increase the use of long-life light bulbs and to lower thermostat settings in the winter and raise them in the summer would all be helpful . see these figures for canadian cost comparison : http : //cna.ca/english/studies/comparative_costs_of_generation_technologies_sept-06-en.pdf how much does wind energy cost ? http : //www.awea.org/faq/wwt_costs.html # how % 20much % 20does % 20wind % 20energy % 20cost energy return on investment ( eroi ) for wind energy : http : //www.eoearth.org/article/energy_return_on_investment_ ( eroi ) _for_wind_energy part i : wind power background turbines one megawatt of energy has a by product of 1,600 tons of carbon dioxide , 9 tons of sulfur dioxide and 4 tons of nitrous oxide when produced by conventional methods . just to get rid of that much carbon dioxide takes approx . 900,000 trees to absorb it . wind farms require only five percent or less of total land for turbines and access roads , allowing previous land uses such as ranching or farming to continue while the wind farm is in operation . animals are not disturbed by the projects , and most animals will graze right up to the turbines . what size ? today ’ s machines are available in sizes from 700kw to 5000 kw ( awea ) . the cost of a machine varies by size . why larger machines ? larger machines are able to deliver electricity at a lower cost than smaller machines . in areas where it is difficult to find sites for more than a single turbine , a large turbine with a tall tower uses the existing wind resource more efficiently . while 5mw generators have become a reality in today ’ s world , they are mostly off shore where there are no tower or wind restrictions . the farming community based around the mankato area would be ideal for wind farm construction due to miles of flat ground with little growth other than agriculture , ” stated michael greenland of smi & hydraulics during a phone conversation with a student . he further commented , “ once a site has been determined a wind study is conducted . optimum turbine size is determined by the wind study . a power purchase agreement , along with a ‘ who pays what ’ contract can be negotiated after the wind study determines what turbines to use . ” large or small turbine ? reasons for choosing large turbines there are economies of scale in wind turbines , i.e . larger machines are usually able to deliver electricity at a lower cost than smaller machines . the reason is that the cost of foundations , road building , electrical grid connection , plus a number of components in the turbine ( the electronic control system etc . ) , are somewhat independent of the size of the machine . larger machines are particularly well suited for offshore wind power . the cost of foundations does not rise in proportion to the size of the machine , and maintenance costs are largely independent of the size of the machine . in areas where it is difficult to find sites for more than a single turbine , a large turbine with a tall tower uses the existing wind resource more efficiently . reasons for choosing smaller turbines the local electrical grid may be too weak to handle the electricity output from a large machine . this may be the case in remote parts of the electrical grid with low population density and little electricity consumption in the area . there is less fluctuation in the electricity output from a wind park consisting of a number of smaller machines , since wind fluctuations occur randomly , and therefore tend to cancel out . again , smaller machines may be an advantage in a weak electrical grid . the cost of using large cranes , and building a road strong enough to carry the turbine components may make smaller machines more economic in some areas . several smaller machines spread the risk in case of temporary machine failure , e.g . due to lightning strikes . aesthetic landscape considerations may sometimes dictate the use of smaller machines . large machines , however , will usually have a much lower rotational speed , which means that one large machine really does not attract as much attention as many small , fast moving rotors . output range ( kilowatts ) for each size of turbine the amount of energy given by wind is : p= ( 1/2 * air density ) * ( area of turbine ) * ( wind velocity ^ 3 ) wind turbines are only able to use about 59 % of the wind energy that flows through the cross sectional area . much more energy is created at higher wind speeds . so the majority of power is created in short bursts . half the energy is created in about 15 % of the operation time . wind power availability is very dependent on the site of the turbine . the capacity factor of a wind turbine is about 35 % , which means that a turbine will only be able to produce about 35 % of its theoretical power output . source : wikipedia.com what types of turbines are there ? horizontal turbines horizontal axis wind turbines ( hawt ) have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator at the top of a tower , and must be pointed into the wind . the gearboxes and generator are located at the top of the tower . this is a disadvantage because in order to maintain them a person has to climb to the top to do it . an advantage though is that the blades can change their direction and tilt , therefore , they are always collecting the maximum amount of wind . the amount of energy produced by wind is p= ( 1/2 * air density ) * ( area of turbine ) * ( wind velocity ^ b ) where p = power and b = number of blades ( wikipedia.com ) . vertical turbines vertical axis wind turbines ( or vawts ) have the main rotor shaft running vertically . the generator and gearbox are located on the ground ; this is advantageous because when maintenance needs to be done no one needs to climb up a tall tower . mesas , hilltops , ridgelines and passes have wind that is lower to the ground and this type of wind turbine can gather this wind the most efficiently . however , these turbines need to be installed on level land . a weibull distribution graph is usually used to describe the wind variation in a given area . this graph shows the percentage of time of a given wind speed . this graph is used to find the power availability since wind power is proportional to the cube of wind speed . a perfectly designed turbine would be able to pull only 59 % of the wind 's potential energy ( betz ’ s law ) . an actual turbine is not 100 % efficient so it would only be able to pull about 70 % of the 59 % possible through betz 's law . as the wind passes through the turbine the wind slows down . an ideal turbine would only slow wind to 2/3 of its original speed . wind turbines are also designed to start operating at certain wind speeds and stop operating at higher speeds . source : www.windpower.org energy units the ability to generate electricity is measured in watts . watts are very small units , so the terms kilowatt ( kw , 1,000 watts ) , megawatt ( mw , 1 million watts ) , and gigawatt ( pronounced `` jig-a-watt , '' gw , 1 billion watts ) are most commonly used to describe the capacity of generating units like wind turbines or other power plants . electricity production and consumption are most commonly measured in kilowatt-hours ( kwh ) . a kilowatt-hour means one kilowatt ( 1,000 watts ) of electricity produced or consumed for one hour . one 50-watt light bulb left on for 20 hours consumes one kilowatt-hour of electricity ( 50 watts x 20 hours = 1,000 watt-hours = 1 kilowatt-hour ) . the output of a wind turbine depends on the turbine 's size and the wind 's speed through the rotor . wind turbines being manufactured now have power ratings ranging from 250 watts to 5 megawatts ( mw ) . example : a 10-kw wind turbine can generate about 10,000 kwh annually at a site with wind speeds averaging 12 miles per hour , or about enough to power a typical household . a 5-mw turbine can produce more than 15 million kwh in a year -- enough to power more than 1 , 400 households . the average u.s. household consumes about 10,000 kwh of electricity each year . sources : american wind energy association , minnesota pollution control a gency , cielo wind power , and the danish wind i ndustry association faa regulations faa regulations require aircraft warning lights installed on all towers taller than 200 feet . turbines on wind energy farms generally stand between 300 to 400 feet high . there could be more than 200 generators on stretches of land reaching for miles . engineers visited eleven sites to come up with recommendations to enhance aviation safety while satisfying the concerns of neighbors . the blue canyon wind farm near lawton , oklahoma , consists of 43 turbines topped with only 17 lights . visual guidance experts installed lights on windmills at each end of a row , then spaced lights on towers a half-mile apart . they have determined that configuration should be sufficient to indicate the farm to pilots , without creating light pollution for surrounding communities . with heights of modern utility-scale wind turbines exceeding 200 ft ( 61 m ) , wind energy developers in recent years have had to submit lighting proposals for wind plants to the federal aviation administration ( faa ) . the current faa guidelines for wind plant obstruction lighting have not been developed to a level where developers can know with some certainty what lighting scheme the faa will approve for proposed construction . the california wind energy collaborative ( cwec ) initiated a study of faa obstruction lighting for wind plants to determine the issues surrounding the subject . a literature survey and interviews on the subject were conducted . during the period of investigation , the cwec was able to observe flight tests with the faa of a wind farm configured for new lighting standards . key elements of the proposed standards are synchronization of the flashing lights and maximum 0.5 mi . ( 0.8 km ) spacing between lighted turbines . it is expected that the new standards will improve flight safety and streamline the faa recommendation and permitting processes for wind plant developments . source : http : //www.energy.ca.gov/pier/final_project_reports/cec-500-2005-180.html siting ( location ) when choosing a site for a possible wind farm you need to plan the actual site and location , whether you will buy or rent land . all these parts , when formed together make up the site location . using this information will enable you to make the best possible choice for a wind farm location . wind energy is growing in the energy market . with any business like this , rural landowners that are interested in leasing land should do some research in the process . leases , taxes and easements are major concerns for steps dealing with wind turbine land . wind developers must take into consideration some ideas before leasing land for installing a wind turbine . they need to line up funds for the project and have some type of commitment from the energy buyers . also to complete any needed ecological analyses , zoning and permitting processes . if the place they are setting up is a good wind source , many of the wind developers will make a written contract with the land owners to show what steps will be taken and also to show these agreements in writing . if it all goes in the beginning of this project then a lease agreement will be made . the landowner might not have many financial responsibilities , but the wind developers will try to offer some type of payment plan . wind farms in minnesota main minnesota wind power projects are in buffalo ridge . in july 2005 there are 51 wind projects in minnesota operating 683 turbines and which is enough to power about 230 , 000 homes . a 5 county area in southwest minnesota is home to more then 70 percent of the states wind power production . existing projects are located in north shaokatan , shaokatan hills , lake benton ii , viking , chanarambie , moraine , woodstock , buffalo ridge , ruthton , lake benton i , and lakota ridge . land lease rates farmers in southern minnesota who choose to lease land to wind developers can annually receive 2500- 5000 dollars per turbine . “ rural landowners like widdel who lease their land to wind developers typically receive about 2 percent – 4 percent of the gross annual turbine revenue — or $ 2,000 to $ 4,000 for each turbine — which can help compensate for a downturn in commodity prices . annual farm income can be increased by $ 70 an acre . ” source : http : //www.neo.ne.gov/neq_online/oct2003/oct2003.02.htm leasing land with any business like this , rural landowners interested in leasing land should do some research in the process . leases , taxes and easements are major concerns for steps when dealing with wind turbine land . wind developers must take into consideration some ideas before leasing land for installing a wind turbine . next , they need to line up funds for the project and have some type of commitment from the energy buyers . finally , they must complete any needed ecological analyses , zoning and permitting processes . also if the place they are setting up is a good wind source . wind developers will make a written contract with the landowners to show what steps will be taken and also to show these agreements in writing . if it all goes in the beginning of this project then a lease agreement will be made . the landowner might not have many financial responsibilities , but the wind developers will try to offer some type of payment plan . many people do not buy the land but lease it or even have an easement which is an interest in land that is owned by another that gives the owner interest to a limited use or enjoyment of the land . wind projects require a permit from one or more government agencies . it can be permitted within 12 months . permitting included federal , state and local agencies . this includes existing laws and regulations , location of wind turbines and associated facilities or equipment , need for transmission lines , access roads , size of wind farm and ownership of land . the greatest benefit of having wind turbines on their property will be the contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and for others it will be the guaranteed income for the life of the turbines ( 20 to 25 years ) . currently you could expect up to $ 3000 per megawatt installed ( or part there off ) per annum with no expenditure at all . the process of establishing wind turbines can be a drawn out affair and may take 2 to 3 years from first contact to construction and commissioning . things to consider before building on a site : consultation with neighbors and nearby residents consultation with local community consultation with the council the undertaking of an environmental effects study a study into flora and fauna ( birds ) issues native title issues planning and permitting wind turbines pose little threat to birds ; there is little real evidence here or overseas that bird strikes on wind turbines present any real problem providing the turbines are placed with care and thought . the americans who in the 80 ’ s built several wind farms in california have largely caused the concern regarding bird strikes . these wind farms were built without consideration of aesthetic or environmental issues and caused many problems including bird kills . the wind industry worldwide has learned from this experience and no reputable wind farm developer would consider the wall-to-wall wind turbine option . ice falling from turbines may be a concern in some areas . transmission transmission lines electrical power transmission refers to bulky transfer of electric power from a power plant to a substation . power transmission usually takes place at high voltages ( usually 110 kv or above ) due to very large amount of power involved . electric power can be transmitted in two ways : overhead transmission . underground transmission . transmission losses it is necessary to transmit the electricity at high voltage to reduce the fraction of energy lost . for a given amount of power transmitted , a higher voltage reduces the current and thus the resistive losses in the conductor . long distance transmission is typically done with overhead lines at voltages of 110 to 1200 kv . in an alternating current transmission line , the inductance and capacitance of the line conductors can be significant . the currents that flow in these components of transmission line impedance constitute reactive power , which transmits no energy to the load . reactive current flow causes extra losses in the transmission circuit . the fraction of real power ( transmitted to the load ) to the apparent power is the power factor . so as reactive current increase , which will increases the reactive power , by result power factor reduces . for low power factors , losses will increase . utilities add capacitor banks and other components throughout the system—such as phase-shifting transformers , static var compensators , and flexible ac transmission systems ( facts ) —to control reactive power flow for reduction of losses and stabilization of system voltage . potential problems because they must generally be sited in exposed places , wind turbines are often highly visible . some people might view these turbines as an eyesore , however proper sitting decisions can help to avoid any aesthetic impacts to the landscape . one strategy that could be used to partially offset visual impacts is to site fewer turbines in one specific location . with the technology of today ’ s larger and more efficient models of wind turbines this is quite possible . like all mechanical systems wind turbines produce some noise when they operate . most of the turbine noise is masked by the wind itself , and naturally the wind turbines only work when the wind is blowing . one of the biggest concerns is that wind turbines could be possibly cause potential interference with radar and telecommunications facilities . lastly , the only potentially toxic or hazardous materials that are tied into wind turbines , are the relatively small amounts of lubricating oils and hydraulic and insulation fluids . contamination of surface , ground water , and soils is highly unlikely because of this . source : http : //windeis.anl.gov/guide/concern/index.cfm ( viewed on 2-26-07 ) as you can see when dealing with environmental issues , wind turbines benefits out weigh the concerns . in dealing with this information wind turbines should seriously be considered being installed , to help reverse our deteriorating environment . budget cost tubular towers account for about 20-25 % of the total cost lattice towers account for about 15 % of the total cost source : smi & hydraulics , http : //www.ilec.coop/aspx/news/default.aspx ? newsid=789 the cost of wind towers and power lines varies greatly depending on location . therefore only rough estimates could be made without getting an estimate and contract from a company . lattice and tubular towers are available . however tubular towers are the most popular choice . the tower itself generally costs about 20 % of the total project . according to michael greenman at smi & hydraulics in porter , mn from their most recent project the total cost of the towers were as follows : 64.5 meter – 1.25mw - $ 260,000 ; 74.5 meter – 1.25mw - $ 320,000 ; 78 meter – 1.8mw - $ 425,000 . according to michael the power line costs vary too greatly and the power line company would have to be contacted for a contract . michael can be contacted at 1-507-296-4551 ext . 236 or michael.greenman @

money for renewable energy projects . xcel energy is another source . xcel , because of their agreement with the state of mn that they can store prairie island nuclear waste in minnesota , must put money into a renewable energy fund . st. olaf college ’ s wind turbine was paid for by money ( 1.4 million ) from xcel energy . benefits of wind power “ a 1 megawatt wind turbine will annually displace emissions of 1,600 tons of carbon dioxide that would have otherwise come from other means of generating electricity . this emission reduction would reduce smog , acid rain , and greenhouse gases . it takes approximately 900,000 trees to absorb the carbon dioxide that these other means of generating electricity come from . wind turbines require only minimal amounts of water for periodic blade cleaning . wind energy production uses less than 1/600 as much water per kwh of electricity produced as nuclear power uses , and approximately 1/500 as much as coal uses . unlike fossil fuels and nuclear power plants , wind projects have absolutely no adverse environmental impact associated with fuel development and transportation of waste disposal . wind farms require only 5 percent or less of total land for turbines and access roads , allowing previous land uses such as ranching or farming to be almost completely unparsed . animals are not disturbed by the projects , and most will graze right up to the turbines . tubular towers , uv reflective paint and underground wires discourage birds from perching in harms way and dramatically decrease bird deaths . also precautions are taken so that the turbines are not in the way of migratory paths . ” source : http : //www.cielowind.com/environmentalfacts.htm ( 2-26-07 ) part ii : wind power options scenarios for the mankato city council to consider scenario 1 : partnerships there are two possibilities in the city/power company joint partnership . possibility one is a demonstration project that would entail building a small number of wind turbines . in this partnership , msu , mankato , the city of mankato , scc , benco , and north mankato , might become partners and look for funding . in fact benco may know of a source for partial funding of this project . this project would be a demonstration , rather than a commitment to renewable energy for the citizens of the city . the second possible partnership would be on a scale to provide renewable electrical power to the city . in this situation , the city might help provide some of the financing through selling bonds . the city could partner with generation and transmission ( g & t ) power companies such as xcel , or distribution cooperatives such as benco to put this possibility in to effect . the united states ranks third in the world in wind power capacity , where government programs have helped support the power development . in any productive business relationship , there needs to be some form of reliable partnership between the two companies . for this scenario , it is proposed that the city of mankato set up a partnership with an energy company , such as xcel energy or benco . the two companies decide to form a business relationship with xcel owning 60 % of the wind farm and mankato owning 40 % . the positive argument to this agreement is that the wind farm would be managed efficiently and correctly . although this is a great benefit , there is also a negative argument and that is the realization that xcel does own more , therefore ultimately have the most say in the matter . the bowling green , ohio project is one good example . bowling green , ohio : there was a wind farm built in the city of bowling green , ohio last year in august ( http : //www.greenenergyohio.org/page.cfm ? pageid=104 ) . the farm consists of two wind turbines . the ownership of these turbines is a joint one between the city itself , american municipal power-ohio , and green mountain electric company . both companies are located in ohio . http : //www.greenenergyohio.org/page.cfm ? pageid105 green mountain electric company wanted to build a wind farm in ohio to decrease its strain on the environment and look for more efficient ways to generate electricity . the people of ohio apparently wanted the same thing . the city ’ s utility director calls the turbines “ a milestone ” for bowling green . it appears from the information taken from the web-site that both the company and the community and very pleased with , as well as proud of , the arrangement . the information found does not include the specifics of how exactly a jointly owned wind farm is operated . it also does not include any information concerning the split costs and earnings of the wind farm . scenario 2 : privately-owned locally or private owned means that one or more members of a local community has a significant direct financial stack in the project other than through land lease payments , tax revenue or other payments in lieu of taxes , according to windustry.org . source : windustry , url : www.newrules.org/de/cwfs.pdf , date viewed : 3/26/07 . it was found that there are not many privately owned turbines . usually , land is privately owned and the turbine and energy created is owned by a corporation . the corporation pays the land owner through a lease agreement . cape breton : cape breton power , nova scotia power ( nspi ) and quantum leap company were the first to develop the glace bay lingan wind power project , which was located in cape breton . a picture of cape breton is located to the right . glace bay is a very successful wind turbine ; it was created within the budget and within the expected time period . within the next decade experts are expecting to put about five hundred million more dollars into the project , between workers salary and the general maintenance of the structure . this project should produce enough energy to service about five thousand homes in the area . it has been a great success story and the main workers on the project are already making plans for future privately owned wind turbine farms to go up around the area . source : cape breton power , url :

ground transmission lines to transport the power source : www.newrules.org/de/cwfs.pdf 3/26/07 ) . cloud county , kansas : it was found that many people would lease their land to an energy corporation . a corporation owns the wind turbine but the land that it sits on is privately owned . cloud county near concordia , kansas is going to allow horizon wind energy to build turbines on private property . horizon ensures that the turbines will not rein the scenery of the land nor will it damage anything . ( www.horizonwind.com/projects/whatweredoing/cloudcounty.aspx 3/26/07 ) scenario 3 : power company owned xcel energy for the mankato area to have a functioning wind farm , consideration must be given to exactly how a project like this would be funded and what kind of ownership would be needed . electrical energy for minnesota and the upper midwest is largely distributed through xcel energy . the possibilities of funding or ownership for a wind farm in the mankato area through xcel energy is a feasible and realistic since xcel is one of the nations leading producers of wind energy . xcel has been involved with the wind-energy industry since 1980. according to the american wind energy association ’ s ( awea ) annual industry ranking report , released march 15 , 2006 , “ xcel energy is the nation 's leading purchaser of wind power , with 1,048 megawatts of wind-generated electricity . xcel energy also announced its intentions to increase its energy from wind by about 2300 mw by the end of 2007 and to add an additional 1,700 mw by 2012 ” . also , “ xcel energies windsource® program , that is available in colorado , new mexico and minnesota , ranks number one in total number of customer participants ( nearly 50,000 ) by the u.s. department of energy 's national renewable energy laboratory ( nrel ) ” in its annual ranking of leading utility green power programs . the windsource® program allows customers to specify exactly how much wind energy they wish to purchase , the rate for this energy is higher , but tax credits are given to compensate for the higher cost . ( www.xcelenergy.com ) there are possibilities that xcel energy would collaborate with the city of mankato in a wind energy project . they have shown to be serious contributors and supporters of alternative energy and as stated before , are one of the nation ’ s top suppliers of wind energy . scenario 4 : state/federally owned the list of state and or federally owned wind farms is not very extensive but we did find several examples . the following states that are operating with state and federally owned wind farms are the four subheadings below . massachusetts : the company massachusetts technology collaborative has state-owned wind turbines that are now held in storage . the wind turbines would be used in a community served by the people who invested in the utilities that require customers to spend about $ 6 yearly to the state 's alternative energy fund .

( tennessee valley authority . http : //www.tva.gov/greenpowerswitch/index.htm . viewed on 22 , march 2007 . ) in this example , tva is making the smaller companies pay for the construction of the wind farms as well as the miscellaneous materials needed to maintain it . the company will then buy one hundred percent of the power from them to pay for the building costs and eventually make a profit . with a state program the similar process happens . states and federal also give out grants to help with funding and costs . having a wind turbine that is state or federally owned is a possibility , but first the city of mankato must weigh out all other options and scenarios . it must be known if the party obtaining the wind energy can afford to pay for it all and then get payment as energy is produced , or if any method is more feasible or just a better way to go about producing wind energy . scenario 5 : municipally owned locally , new ulm , st. peter , and rochester own their municipal power companies . one would not have to travel extremely far from mankato to find an example of municipally owned wind turbines . algona iowa has three wind turbines owned by a consortium of municipal utilities . according to rod vitzthum , the line superintendent of algona municipal utility , the turbines have been doing extremely well . cfu has been offering customers a chance to sign up for wind power , paying an extra $ 2.50 per month . since the project has started in june 1999 there has been a response of 600 people . the production in 1999 of the wind turbines was enough to supply the power needs of 673 homes . these three turbines , however , did a lot more than power the needs of 673 homes . these turbines were responsible of the offset of over 13 million pounds of global warming emissions , as well as trace metals like mercury and arsenic commonly released from coal-fired power plants . in looking at the bigger picture the state of iowa itself have over 327 large-scale wind turbines with a general capacity 242 mw . these turbines harvest enough energy to power 80,000 homes . iowa is definitely on the right track to figuring out possible solutions when it comes to global warming . it should be noted that iowa is only the 10th largest of the contiguous u.s. states , according to a federal study of wind potential in the u.s. ( http : //www.awea.org/news/news991211alg.html 3/26/07 ) . in june 1997 planning for a municipally owned wind farm began . seven different utility companies partnered together to found the iowa distributed generation project with cedar falls utility spearheading the operation . they were granted 2.8 million dollars from the department of energy and the electric power research institutes help aid in the costs of developing a wind farm . the finished wind farm began operation in october 1998 near algona iowa . the wind farm consists of three zond z-750 wind turbines that together are capable of producing 2.25 megawatts . algona , iowa the algona municipal utilities ’ wind farm is one of the seven wind farms that are part of the wind turbine verification program ( tvp ) . the tvp is a program developed by the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) . the purpose of the program is to promote the use of commercial wind turbines . the program will assess the reliability , performance , and cost of several selected wind farm locations . funding and support for the project is supported by the u.s. d.o.e . and the epri .

jeff casalina page page 4 building on the uw-green bay master plan : promoting sustainability energy generation and conservation options environmental science & policy 763 capstone class dec. 14 , 2005 jackie blohowiak jeff casalina ryuichi iwasaki dustin maas there is a growing movement among college campuses to improve the sustainability and environmental consciousness of the campus experience . rising energy prices and a backlash to the current administration policies on issues such as global climate change have sparked an interest in sustainability . for the current seminar in environmental science and policy ( also known as the “ capstone seminar ” ) the students decided to look at sustainability options for the uw- green bay campus . the focus of our group is energy . our group , consisting of jackie blohowiak , ryuichi iwasaki , dustin maas and jeff casalina , did some investigation that included two meetings with the facilities manager , les raduenz , and a tour of the “ power plant ” that generates and supplies heating and cooling for the major buildings on campus . ( a misnomer , the power plant , does not generate any power . ) mr. raduenz provided us with the july 2005 ( the highest month for energy usage ) power bill from the local utility and printouts of the entire electricity and natural gas charges and amounts consumed for the past year . he also supplied a list of campus vehicles and data on gasoline and diesel consumption . limited opportunities for greater energy efficiencies according to mr. raduenz , the university has already done most of what it can to conserve energy . thermostats are monitored at the power plant and are set to the most efficient comfort level possible . budget restraints limit the number of campus vehicles , and landscape vehicle usage is curtailed by reducing the amount of grassy area that is mowed . while it would seem that there is always room for improvement , additional efficiencies appear limited by several significant factors : many of the campus buildings were constructed in the 1970s , and retrofitting for energy savings would be prohibitively expensive , if not physically impossible . while there is the possibility of installing sub-metering ( described below ) to identify areas of inefficiency , changing the ventilation systems so that some rooms within a building could be heated or cooled while others in the building would not would require reworking the entire ductwork and thermostat control wiring of every building . because campus buildings are considered commercial structures , they fall under the ashrae requirement of supplying a minimum of 15 cubic feet per minute per person of fresh outside air ( ashrae , 2005 ) . in order to comply with this standard , ventilation systems are set to provide six complete air changes per hour . all of this air is heated or cooled and then exhausted outdoors . this requirement negates many of the efficiencies common in residential construction , most notably sealing the home from the intrusion of outside air . laboratory chemical hoods require additional exhausting of interior air to the outside . social factors associated with different work habits and comfort requirements are also significant and not readily changeable . there are instances where one person may want to work late or on a weekend . this requires that the entire building be heated or cooled for that one person . the suggestion that night or weekend classes all be held in the same building ( so that only one building needs heating and cooling ) instead of throughout the campus has been met with opposition since different departments prefer to use their own buildings and may require specialized rooms such as laboratories and art studios . mary ann cofrin ( mac ) hall is an example of some of the efficiencies that might be achieved if the university were given a “ clean slate ” in designing a new building . constructed only three years ago , the building incorporates passive solar , photovoltaics and green construction design features . nevertheless , its efficiencies are nominal as it only generates enough electricity to power a few computers or cell phones , and the ventilation system functions in the same manner as the other buildings on campus . if the university is serious about sustainability , new construction needs to go further in achieving energy efficiency . sub- metering as mr. raduenz mentioned , large retrofits for energy savings are expensive . projects that are taken on by the university need to be able to pay for themselves within an acceptable period of time . currently the electricity and natural gas for academic buildings are delivered to the physical plant where it is metered and converted to a useful form and distributed . the energy use of each building is unknown and therefore makes it difficult to quantify retrofitting projects . sub-metering is a tool that can be used in the planning process to alleviate the quantification problem . sub-meters measure the incoming load to each building and additional sub-meters are installed to segregate certain areas or systems in the building . operational systems , ventilation for example , can be sub-metered to determine the load required to run the building separate from ancillary energy uses such as lighting and outlets . lighting and electronics that run on outlets can be replaced without extensive retrofitting . efficiencies of lights and electronics are commonly known and can be compared to energy star appliances requiring simple calculations eliminating the need to further sub-meter them . once the buildings are sub-metered , facilities management would be able to locate areas with seemingly high energy consumption . this would apply to operational systems as well as ancillary energy uses . facilities management may be unaware of all the equipment used on campus and could locate older less efficient appliances that need replacement . the operational systems that are identified as highly consumptive can be compared to similar systems allowing approximations of savings to be calculated . a prioritized list of projects would then be available after comparisons are done . detailed renovation and retrofitting costs should be completed before starting a project to determine if an adequate payback is possible . if the project advanced to completion , sub-metering would be able to confirm the savings . the benefits of sub-metering extend beyond its use in the retrofitting process . trends in increased energy consumption can be identified and the problem could be averted with preventative maintenance . failures in the system could also be identified dispatching the proper resources for a rapid response . in doing so it would minimize energy loss and disruptions in the system that could halt the operations of the university . sub-metering does require investment into equipment and maintenance . sub-metering electricity with two sub-meters per building would cost between $ 5000 and $ 7500 . the cost of steam or condensate sub-meters varies greatly with the size of the pipe . monthly maintenance includes calibrating the meters to ensure accuracy ( energy star , 2002 ) . wind power it is apparent that physical and social factors limit significant gains in energy efficiency . therefore , our group recommends that the university should go to the next level of energy sustainability , and install a wind turbine . a wind turbine is recommended because among all of the renewable methods of generating electricity , wind power is currently the most efficient , effectively competing with coal and natural gas ( cec , 1996 ) . for the fiscal year of july 2004 to june 2005 , all campus functions with the exception of housing consumed 18,364,911 kilowatt-hours ( kw-h ) of electricity at a cost of $ 986,046.87 . generating some or all of this electricity using wind power would reduce all types of air pollution associated with generating an equivalent amount of power using coal . using wind power over coal to generate electricity saves about 960 tonnes of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) per gigawatt-hour of electricity generated ( white and kulcinski , 1998 ) . there would also be significant reductions in : nitrogen oxides ( nox ) , a component of photochemical smog , sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) , a component of acid rain , and mercury ( hg ) , a source of human , fish , bird and other wildlife toxicity , mercury builds up in animal tissues and can affect the heart , brain and nervous system ( schmitt , 2005 ) . one-third of the mercury in the u.s. comes from coal-burning electric utility plants the campus would also be reducing its non-renewable fossil fuel consumption . all of these benefits would go a long way toward making the campus more sustainable . vestas wind systems educational opportunities a wind turbine would also provide new educational opportunities . two professors , dr. john katers and dr. john stoll , along with many others , would enjoy creating additional study opportunities based on a campus wind turbine that might include new courses and graduate student projects . topics of interest might include : wind turbine aerodynamics , blade materials and stresses , harmonics in blades and towers , how electrical generators generate electricity , differences between direct drive , gear box and induction turbines , wind turbine output data logging , data logging software , environmental impact studies , site assessments ( geography , topography ) , air masses and turbulence . other area schools and colleges might also appreciate these opportunities as well . demand charges considered a commercial entity , the university is billed for peak and off-peak electricity consumed as well as for a “ demand charge . ” the demand charge represents the amount owed for the maximum amount of power required during any fifteen minute period and is billed on a per peak kilowatt basis . the demand charge for a typical summer month , when air conditioning requirements are high , are about 30 percent of typical billing charges . our group looked for ways to reduce the demand charge . one way that may hold promise for the future is to use off-peak power to generate hydrogen that would be stored and then fed into a fuel cell during peak demand periods . the fuel cell converts the hydrogen back to electricity at the time it is most needed and most expensive . however , telephone conversations with gary shubach at ballard power systems ( a manufacturer of fuel cells ) and wind energy expert , mick sagrillo , indicated that although there are some experimental projects , fuel cell systems are not yet reliable enough for this application . scope , assumptions and limiting conditions the best opportunity for wind power appears to be in reducing the kilowatt-hour consumption portion for the bill . there should also be strong consideration for reducing co2 , even though the financial benefits of reducing greenhouse gases may not directly accrue to the university . to this end , this report focuses primarily on a benefit-cost analysis of the installation of a general electric 1.5 megawatt ( mw ) utility-scale wind turbine . a turbine this large is selected because , being one of the larger utility-scale machines , it would make a significant impact on the utility-grid electricity consumption of the university . a smaller turbine , a 100 kw vestas v-17 , is also evaluated . however , our group feels that a smaller turbine should only be considered as a “ back-up ” project , because while it would still provide a basis for educational opportunities , it would not significantly reduce the grid electricity consumption of the university . in addition to the selection of this particular wind turbine , the scope of this project includes several assumptions and limiting conditions : wind . the campus is located in a u.s. department of energy , class 2 wind area . ( the classes range from 1—the lowest to 5—the highest in wind energy potential . ) wind turbines in a class 2 wind area can expect to operate at 25 percent efficiency per mick sagrillo . this is slightly less than the 30 percent efficiency estimated for another class 2 area utility-scale project in colorado ( lehr , et . al . , 2001 ) in areas with greater wind potential , such as the dakotas and minnesota , efficiencies of 35 percent or more can be expected ( carleton , 2004 ) . for this report , we will err on the conservative side and select 25 percent . a wind energy site assessment was recently completed by amy taivalkoski ( 2005 ) , an independent consultant . her approach to wind variability was different in that she estimated the average wind speed for the various potential sites on campus and used a commercial spread sheet program to calculate reductions in the manufacturers ’ rated outputs ( in kw ) for their various turbine models . whether estimating turbine efficiency based on experience with similar turbines in similar locations or estimating average wind speed , both approaches require professional opinion and judgment , and due to the high variability of wind , both approaches use reduced or more conservative numbers . as stated in the taivalkoski report , “ a 1.3 mph increase in the wind speed changes the payback time by 5 years ! ” ( p. 20 ) . aside from this discussion , it is beyond the scope of this study to analyze which approach is more accurate . cost for wind turbine . according to mick sagrillo , the installed cost for the ge 1.5 mw turbine is about $ 1,500,000 , and the installed cost for the vestas v-17 is about $ 115,000 . however , he also stated that these prices are subject to their availability , and in recent years , demand from europe and elsewhere has caused prices to start to increase . in addition , the exact location on campus will affect the amount of wiring and other infrastructure needed at the installation , and more precise prices will require proposals from wind installation companies . therefore , the $ 1,500,000 and $ 115,000 are considered approximate prices . discount and inflation rates . there are two types of discount rates : a nominal discount rate that is not adjusted to remove the effects of inflation , and a real discount rate , one that has been adjusted to remove the effects of inflation . a nominal discount rate of 7.5 percent is selected for this analysis , because it is recommended by the european wind energy association ( morthorst , 2004 ) and is similar to the 7.82 percent rate used in the afore-mentioned colorado project . with inflation at 5.1 percent ( consumer price index for september 2005 ) , the real discount rate is 2.4 percent ( 7.5 minus 5.1 ) . to avoid double accounting for inflation , the real discount rate is applied to annual maintenance costs and annual benefits . it could be argued that we should be using the consumer price index energy rate for the energy savings achieved by the wind turbines . however , lately , the energy rate has been higher than the overall index , but the volatility of the energy rate could add significant error to long-term calculations . maintenance costs . mick sagrillo , amy taivolkoski and windustry.org , a wind industry website that provides financial tools to evaluate potential wind projects , all suggest that maintenance cost are about one percent per year . electricity savings . the electricity savings are a blended rate of on-peak and off-peak charges as shown on the july 2005 utility bill . as mentioned , this is discounted using the 2.4 percent rate . it should also be noted that a wind turbine will be reducing the campus electricity consumption . there will not be excess electricity to sell back to the utility , unless larger or multiple turbines are installed . this is why the blended rate of actual charges is applied , rather than a “ buyback ” rate , as suggested in the wind energy site assessment report . economic life . this is the life expectancy or period at which the turbines are expected to generate electricity . this is typically 20 to 25 years for a wind turbine . the turbines at california ’ s altamont pass are still functioning after 25 years , and other projects use 25 years in their calculations ( eere , 2004 ) . however , manufacturers ’ warrantees are typically less than that , which leads us to believe that 20 years is more appropriate . utility and tax incentives . being a state-owned facility , the university does not qualify for the same incentives that benefit homeowners and private businesses . such incentives might include a production tax credit , cash-back award or low-interest loan . ( cash-back awards and low interest loans are wisconsin focus on energy programs . ) therefore , this benefit–cost analysis is done without consideration of such benefits . environmental benefit . coal fired electricity plants emit approximately 974 tonnes of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) per million kw of electricity generated as compared to 14 tonnes per gigawatt ( million kw ) for wind energy , emitted indirectly because of the energy needed to build and maintain turbines and towers ( white and kulcinski , 1998 ) . 960 tonnes ( 974 minus 14 ) is therefore used as a multiplier to estimate the amount of co2 saved by installing the indicated turbine on campus . under the kyoto protocol , “ annex i ” or industrialized countries are required to reduce their co2 emissions to about five percent below their 1990 levels by 2012. as stated in an energy information agency report , “ [ a ] chieving the national commitments under the treaty is projected to require marginal costs for emissions reductions from domestic sources that range from $ 36 per metric ton of carbon dioxide in canada to $ 64 per metric ton in western europe . ” ( eia , 2005 ) while no market yet exists for co2 credits , these numbers give value to the co2 reductions created by the potential campus wind turbines , and are treated as a range in the calculations . at some point , a co2 emissions trading system may be implemented , and the university could sell co2 credits . this would greatly reduce the cost of the turbine and its payback period . use of financial calculator . for simplicity , all calculations including discounting and compounding are performed on a hewlett-packard 12c financial calculator , and relevant keystrokes are shown . these are : pmt – payments or expenses that occur on an annual basis . pv – present value , a value ( usually discounted ) in today ’ s dollars . fv – future value , a value ( usually compounded ) in dollars at a point in the future . n – the number of periods in years . i – the discount or inflation rate . the general electric 1.5 mw turbine costs construction costs : $ 1,500,000 pv = $ 1,500,000 maintenance costs ( 1 % /yr ) : $ 15,000 pmt , 20 n , 2.4 % i ,

in-spite-of a lack of utility and tax incentives . considering that most university capital improvements are simply expenses borne by taxpayers , students and benefactors , a wind turbine would provide environmental and educational benefits and would pay for itself . the co2 reduction is significant for the 1.5 mw turbine . the 3,285,000 kw-h/yr represent about 18 percent of the total annual electricity consumption of the university . even though the university consumes substantial quantities of natural gas and generates greenhouse gases through vehicle usage and other sources , an 18 percent reduction in co2 emissions , from electricity generation , goes a long way toward making the university compliant with the kyoto protocol . as stated before , the university may be able to sell co2 credits in a future emissions trading system . uw- green bay would not be alone among college campuses that possess wind turbines . a growing number of campuses across the country have installed wind turbines for power generation and educational purposes . at least three colleges have utility-scale turbines either constructed or planned . carleton college in minnesota recently installed a 1.6 mw turbine ( carleton , 2004 ) , and 660 kw turbines are planned for turtle mountain community college in north dakota and fort peck community college in montana , both native american community colleges ( eere , 2004 ) . in wisconsin , three colleges have or are installing smaller ( 100 kw or less ) turbines : lakeshore technical college , nicolet technical college and matc- mequon . other issues birds : the issue of bird fatalities arises with every wind power project , and it is not limited to the u.s. ( owen , 2005 ) . fortunately , the consensus among people who have studied actual wind turbine projects is that the concern about birds is exaggerated . the draft environmental impact statement by the u.s. army corp of engineers for the cape wind energy project , nantucket sound , massachusetts ( army corp , 2005 ) includes a comprehensive literature review of wind projects around the u.s. on the issue of birds . this report concludes that “ [ t ] he number of bird fatalities at the u.s. sites reviewed is low , with the exception of the altamont pass site in california where collisions of diurnal raptors have been reported . ” the report goes on to say that : “ the altamont pass site has a large number and high density of turbines… the altamont pass site has close spacing of turbines… the altamont pass site has perch sites for raptors on turbines ( lattice tower or accessible work platform ) … the altamont pass site has highly dissected topography , with turbines placed on steep hillsides… ” in addition , the altamont pass site has vertical spindle turbines that rotate close to the ground . this technology is no longer used . on the issue of bird migration , the report states that “ migrants are typically found at higher elevations , ” and that migrants tend not to fly in weather with poor visibility reducing the possibility of collisions with the turbines . bird mortality by wind turbines is miniscule compared to other hazards . on this issue , our group concluded that , because we are considering only one turbine , of a solid tower design , that there would be a minimum impact on birds ( see fig . 1 ) . fig . 1. bird mortality rates data from pasqualetti , m. ; johnson , g. bats : the wind ’ s ability to generate electricity without many of the environmental impacts associated with other energy sources ( air pollution , water pollution , mercury emissions , and greenhouse gas emissions associated with global climate change ) can significantly benefit all species . nowadays , wind farms are becoming more commonplace all over the world . although providing a clean source of electrical power , these structures have the potential to kill both birds and bats . to understand the relationship of wind turbines and bird and bat mortality , the national wind coordinating committee ( nwcc ) wildlife workgroup , which is a part of the united states department of agriculture , was formed in 1994 ( national , 2004 ) . the initial purpose was to provide a forum for dialogue among researchers , conservationists , wind industry representatives , and federal , state and local officials . the workgroup has produced a report that summarizes the current knowledge about bird and bat-wind interaction ( sagrillo , 2003 ) . the interaction of bats with wind turbines is , like many other behaviors that bats exhibit , not well understood . one of these reports , `` synthesis and comparison of baseline avian and bat use , raptor nesting , and mortality information from proposed and existing wind developments , '' by west , inc. , released december , 2002 , concludes that `` bat collision mortality during the breeding season is virtually non-existent , despite the fact that relatively large numbers of bat species have been documented in close proximity to wind plants . these data suggest that wind plants do not currently impact resident breeding populations where they have been studied in the u.s. '' ( sagrillo , 2003 ) . moreover , the buffalo ridge report also comes to the following conclusions : the wind plant probably does not impact bat breeding populations in the project area , and preliminary data indicate that the population of bats susceptible to turbine collisions is large enough that the observed mortality is not sufficient to cause population declines ( johnson , 2003 ) . the study concludes by putting a number on the bat mortality that ranges from 2.45 to 3.21 bat fatalities per turbine , depending on location of the wind farm . the kewaunee county report came up with similar results . over the two-year span of that study , researchers documented 1.16 bat fatalities per turbine per year ( howe , 2002 ) . adjusting for possible sampling error could bring this number as high as 4.26 bat fatalities per turbine per year ( sagrillo , 2003 ) . like the other studies , the kewaunee county report found that the bulk of those killed by the wind turbines , over 90 % , were migrating bats , not resident breeding populations , and no endangered or threatened species have been involved . we do know that many bats , like birds , die due to collisions with lighthouses , communications towers , tall buildings , power lines , and fences . nevertheless , as with birds , the number of fatalities due to wind turbines is extremely low compared to collisions with other man-made structures ( johnson , 2003 ) . wind power and bird/bat population can and do coexist . vestas wind systems aesthetics : the issue of aesthetics is very personal . some people consider wind turbines to be an eyesore , whereas others find them pleasing . this variation of opinion makes an appraisal of a view difficult at best , and in wisconsin , there have been no appraisals conducted to determine the impact of wind turbines on property values . our group feels that people should appreciate the greater environmental benefits of wind power over the less tangible benefits of a view . while there are legitimate concerns about birds , aesthetics and other issues , “ [ t ] hese issues are often used as ‘ straw men ’ to mask other , less noble objections such as the desire not to mar a view shed , preventing the competition from a new renewable source of electricity and just the simple desire not to have these huge pieces of equipment ‘ in my backyard . ’ ” ( duke university , 2005 ) we highly recommend that the university proceed with the installation of a 1.5 mw wind turbine . the politic al and financial implications of wind energy interviews : in order to gather more information about the logistics and politics of installing a wind turbine on campus , a number of interviews were conducted . les raduenz is the facilities manager at the university of wisconsin green bay and he offered a number of insights regarding the installation of a wind turbine on campus . in addition , he provided a tour of the university ’ s power plant and explained in more detail why the power plant requires the greatest amount of energy as compared to any other building on campus . namely , he explained how there is little incentive for the university to conserve energy throughout the year because of the way that the university pays for natural gas . they do not pay for natural gas on a monthly basis . instead they participate in fuel bidding whereby they forecast the amount of natural gas they will use throughout the year and purchase that amount for the entire year . however , if the university uses more or less than the amount set aside for them , it incurs penalty charges . this is because the natural gas supplier has set aside the gas for the university ’ s use and would be unable to sell it to another potential customer . therefore , there is a strong incentive for the university to consume the amount of natural gas that they originally purchased . additionally , mr. raduenz explained how it is difficult to monitor the energy use in individual rooms and buildings since there are a limited number of meters throughout campus . from an energy conservation standpoint , this makes it difficult to identify which buildings are more efficient than others since multiple buildings run off the same thermostat . one solution would be to schedule night classes in the same building rather than having them scattered throughout campus . since there are a limited number of students and faculty on campus during that time , the amount of heat going to the rest of campus could be lowered . however , some faculty members have expressed that this would be a difficult task since they need the equipment in their respective buildings to teach classes . a second interview was conducted with chip bircher and john christiano from wisconsin public service corporation . chip bircher is the renewable energy product manager and john christiano is the electric operations consultant for wisconsin public service . the purpose of the interview was to gain additional insight regarding the logistics of installing a wind turbine on campus . one issue of discussion was the issuance of rate charges . according to mr. bircher and mr. christiano , for any individual month the university is charged the peak demand rate that was achieved during that month for the entire month . therefore , the highest amount of energy the university consumes on any given day will determine the charge per kw-h for each day of the month . this concept is important for two reasons . first , the ability of a wind turbine to offset energy costs is dependant upon peak energy costs . we can not calculate the cost savings on a day by day basis . rather , we need to compare the wind energy cost savings to the charges that would be incurred during peak energy demand . furthermore , it brings up the issue of whether the university would be able to meet peak energy demands with a wind turbine , and if not , how the university would prepare to meet those energy needs . since the wind turbine would not offset all of the energy needs , the university would have to tap into current methods of consuming energy via fossil fuel combustion . however , during times of low energy demand , it may be possible for electricity generated from the wind turbine to be banked and used at a later point in time , perhaps during peak energy demand , to help decrease the charge that would be applied for the entire month . another obstacle that mr. bircher and mr. christiano identified is “ behind the meter ” installation . “ behind the meter ” means that the wind turbine would be incorporated into the system after the meter that wisconsin public service uses to charge the university . if it is installed further upstream , “ before the meter ” , then the wind turbine would be considered wisconsin public service property . one problem that arises with installing a large wind turbine , such as a 1.5 mw wind turbine , “ behind the meter ” is that it requires expensive equipment to wire into the university ’ s electrical system since it is not intended to accept such large amounts of electricity ( see fig . 2 ) . shape \* mergeformat fig . 2. behind the meter schematic bircher , c. and christiano , j. lastly , mr. bircher and mr. christiano suggested that the university install a 65 kw wind turbine since they felt it would be easier to incorporate into the system . however , they felt the payback periods for both the 65 kw and 1.5 mw wind turbines would be comparable . a third interview conducted with dr. dean rodeheaver and tom maki discussed the university ’ s perspective on installing a wind turbine . dr. rodeheaver is the assistant chancellor for planning and budget and professor of human development ( psychology ) and tom maki is the vice chancellor of business and finance . dr. rodeheaver and mr. maki brought up a number of issues . first , the university would only receive 3 percent of the monetary profits realized from the wind turbine . this is because the state handles most of the budgeting and divides profits among other state universities . they feel that this creates a disincentive for the university to install a wind turbine if the money would not stay localized . a major concern is public perception of a wind turbine . both dr. rodeheaver and mr. maki are concerned that installing a wind turbine would deteriorate the relationship with the community . there has been past community concern regarding the height of the weidner center and the installation of the lights at the soccer field . therefore , judging from past concerns of the community , they felt that a wind turbine would create animosity with the surrounding residents . lastly , they were concerned with having to perform an environmental impact statement which could lead to increased time , money , and energy . even though dr. rodeheaver and mr. maki were concerned with these issues of installing a wind turbine , they did feel that it was important to promote sustainability on campus . they suggested doing an article in the fourth estate on the environmental heritage of the university . they would like to see a discussion about the past , present and future of environmental stewardship on this campus . they felt that a wind turbine could be a major contribution to the environmental theme of the university . they also suggested researching other types of renewable energy sources that were not as controversial as a wind turbine and the possibility of increasing education about sustainability at freshman orientation . opportunities although these are valid concerns , a number of opportunities may be realized through the installation of a wind turbine on campus . the wind turbine could provide educational opportunities and may help draw students wishing to attend a university that promotes sustainability and environmental stewardship . it may also create an incentive for more students to enroll if they see an opportunity to research renewable energy . this research could apply to the wind turbine along with the sustainable techniques currently being applied to mary ann cofrin hall . additionally , if other universities are establishing sustainability initiatives and saving money , the university of wisconsin green bay could potentially experience profits realized by those universities as well . therefore , we may in effect benefit from gains made by other state universities . one solution that dr. rodeheaver and mr. maki suggested was to install a wind turbine to supply the energy needs for campus housing . this would be an opportunity to keep the profits localized since student housing energy bills are paid for by the students . this would help students directly see the outcome in their energy use and respective bills . it would also help students experience the benefits of using renewable energy . this would directly promote sustainable living practices throughout other venues of life as well . lastly , the wind turbine could symbolize sustainable living , if it were located near campus housing . the energy bill : in september 2004 , the governor ’ s energy task force was created by executive order in response to growing energy demands and concern for wisconsin ’ s energy infrastructure ( barth and groves , 2004 ) . the task force was to provide recommendations to the state regarding the need to decrease energy demands . the key recommendations provided by the task force were to increase the statewide use of renewable energy by all customers to 10 percent by 2015 , to increase the state of wisconsin ’ s purchases of renewable energy to 20 percent by 2010 , to improve the state ’ s focus on energy efficiency programs by increasing the role of the public service commission in setting targets and funding levels for energy efficiency , to update and improve the state ’ s energy building codes , and to create rural energy initiatives like increased use of locally developed anaerobic digesters and wind generators . currently , these recommendations have been incorporated into an energy bill for the state of wisconsin that was proposed in november 2005. if passed , this energy bill could generate more of an incentive for the university to install a wind generator or other source of renewable energy . some of the components of the proposed energy bill include maintaining the public benefits fund and using it for the purpose of promoting renewable energy . currently , the public benefits fund has been raided to help balance the budget , and this bill would protect it from this practice . in the past , 40 percent of this fund has been diverted to balance the budget . therefore , the passage of the bill would result in an “ increase ” to the public benefits fund by 40 percent which would lead to an increase in funding for renewable energy projects such as a wind turbine on campus . the energy bill also proposes that 10 percent of all energy produced by utilities be from renewable energy sources by 2015. this creates an incentive for utilities to purchase and build new sources of wind power to meet this requirement from the state . this may create an incentive for a utility to purchase the wind turbine themselves and maintain it for our campus . another component of the energy bill that may affect university energy use is that it would require 20 percent of all state buildings to be leed certified by 2011. and university buildings would fall under the definition of a state building within the energy bill . the reason for this provision in the energy bill is that many feel that the state should lead by example in renewable energy use ( stuart , 2005 ) . if passed , the energy bill would provide for greater incentives and funding for the university to purchase a wind generator . a few sources of funding for the wind turbine may be available for the university . one source of funding may be available through focus on energy . focus on energy is a public-private partnership offering energy information and services to residential , business , and industrial customers throughout wisconsin ( focus on energy ) . if the energy bill is passed , there would be a 40 percent increase from past financial sources for focus on energy to distribute to customers for renewable energy projects . with a surge in funding , there may be an increased possibility for them to aid the university in purchasing a wind turbine . utilities may be another source of funding for a wind turbine . since utilities are looking to meet their renewable energy portfolios and may in the future be required to increase the amount of energy they produce from renewable energy sources , an incentive may exist for them to support a wind turbine project at the university . finally , there may be private businesses throughout the local community looking to improve their public relations . the university could partner with a local business in the venture . the private business could also take advantage of the production tax credit , which would allow for the business to receive tax breaks for purchasing a wind turbine . currently , the production tax credit will be extended until 2007 ( stuart , 2005 ) . geothermal heat pumps and sustainable thermal energy production the increased expansion of approximately 2,500 students proposed in the master plan will require the construction of new academic and residential buildings . heating and cooling will require significant expenditures in the construction , operation , and maintenance of the new facilities . the heating and cooling for existing academic buildings is done centrally at the physical plant using a natural gas boiler while dormitories and on-campus apartments use natural gas furnaces to provide heat . students are allowed to use window unit air conditioners for cooling that run using electricity . thermal energy production and distribution on campus is currently reliant on fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal . new construction represents opportunities to break the dependence on fossil fuels and take a step toward a more sustainable campus . the use of geothermal heat pumps for heating and cooling of buildings is a sustainable option . geothermal systems utilize the stored energy of the earth to heat and cool buildings . electricity is still required to power the pumps but if coupled with a wind turbine , the system would produce no emissions . using the earth as an energy source requires a geothermal exchange field . the sizing of the field is directly proportional to the energy input required by the system to adequately heat and cool the facility . to reduce the surface area requirement the exchange field can be installed vertically . according to mike alf of van 's refrigeration services inc. ( 2005 ) , every ton of system capacity requires 150 feet of bore hole and is typically drilled up to 300 feet allowing approximately 2 tons per bore hole . a minimum spacing of approximately fifteen feet between boreholes is required to eliminate the effects of neighboring bore holes . a ton of capacity can provide heating and cooling for approximately 400 square feet of academic space ( rogers , 2005 ) and 600 square feet for residential space ( rafferty , 2003 ) . these are estimates for traditional buildings and the square feet serviced by ton could be increased using greener construction practices . the capital cost of a geothermal system is higher than a conventional system . this is especially true for academic buildings on this campus because only an expansion to the cooling system would be needed ( raduenz , 2005 ) . an approximate cost of a vertical geothermal heat pump system provided by john rogers ( 2005 ) of vyron corporation is $ 4,800 per ton of capacity . for a residential building the cost per square foot is approximately $ 8.00 and for an academic building it is approximately $ 12.00 per square foot . a major portion of the cost of the system is the exchange field . the use of a vertical exchange field adds approximately $ 800 per ton to the cost . this comes out to an additional $ 1.33 per square foot for residential buildings and $ 2.00 per square foot for the academic buildings . another major cost of the system along with boring is the tubing used for the circulation of the fluid in the exchange field . the tubing used is pvc and is a petroleum product . the cost of the tubing increases as oil prices increase . the volatility of oil prices results in the fluctuation of system installation costs ( clary , 2005 ) . the capital costs of geothermal systems may seem prohibitive . however , the capital costs are usually offset by reduced operation and maintenance costs within a half a year to five years of operation with most systems seeing a payback within three years ( fhp , 2001 ) . for the operation of a residential system , 30 percent savings can be expected over a conventional natural gas hvac system that is 90 percent efficient ( clary , 2005 ) . bloomquist ( 1999 ) estimates operation costs of a vertical geothermal system based on case studies for 34 sites to be around $ 8.20 per square meter per year in an academic building . this is a savings of 28 percent over a traditional natural gas system . the major energy requirements of the system are the pumps . typically a 10 horsepower pump is required for every 100 tons of cooling capacity . energy star® pumps are available and variable speed pumps can have eer ratings of up to 16. geothermal heat pump systems in commercial buildings are usually forced air systems requiring motors . general electric manufactures electrical computated motors ( ecm ) that identify different air requirements throughout the system and maintain the air movement as needed . this is more efficient than a typical motor that forces air at a sustained flow regardless of the actual flow needed because the ecm runs less often using less electricity ( clary , 2005 ) reduced service and maintenance costs also contribute to the quick payback of geothermal systems . when the total service and maintenance costs of existing systems were distributed throughout the life of the systems , the systems saved on average 23 cents per square foot per year ( cane et al , 1998 ) . the service and maintenance costs of the systems were an average of 25 systems surveyed by the author . the costs were compared to average service and maintenance costs provided in the american society of heating , refrigerating , and air conditioning engineers manual . reduced costs are attributed to the simplicity of the system . less equipment is needed in a geothermal system than a conventional system . economies of scale on campus may reduce this benefit in academic buildings because only one physical plant is required for multiple buildings . the heating and cooling of future buildings is an area that the university can improve the sustainability of the campus while decreasing the cost of operation . geothermal heat pumps rely on the stored energy of the earth instead of fossil fuels and when coupled with wind energy produces no emissions . while the initial cost of the system is high , a payback can be expected within five years due to reduced operation and maintenance costs . geothermal heat pumps should be considered for new building construction . conservation education as the campus moves towards sustainability , energy conservation needs to be an integral part of the process along with renewable energy . currently energy conservation education is limited to a few paragraphs and bullets points on the university of wisconsin-green bay ’ s ( 2005 ) web page and the effectiveness is proportionate to the importance given to it . energy conservation education can be a minimal cost investment to reduce energy consumption on the university of wisconsin-green bay campus . the behaviors learned and practiced while on campus will hopefully have reaches off campus as well , in terms of the student ’ s home and influence on others . energy conservation education is needed because new students come to this campus annually without ever having to think about the expense and environmental ramifications of the electricity and natural gas that powers and heats their homes . while on campus , the economic cost of energy is hidden in a fixed fee every student pays at the beginning of the semester regardless of the energy wasted . only during a crisis , is the urgency of energy conservation is realized , whether it is the first energy bill the student receives while living on his/her own or an economic shortfall in the state and schools budget . the ub green program at the state university of new york at buffalo is considered one of the top campus environmental programs in the united states . in a report by irt environment inc. ( 1996 ) , ub green identified the keys to a successful energy conservation education program as awareness and participation . awareness provides the reason energy conservation is necessary , especially as it relates to sustainability , and also sets out strategies used to achieve energy conservation . participation is the follow through . the complexity of an energy conservation education program can vary but should start out being simple and progress in complexity and extent as it gains support from the students as well as the university . education can start with campus residents at floor meetings at the beginning of the academic year . strategies for achievement should be affixed ( so they can ’ t be removed or thrown out ) in the residents ’ rooms and in heavily trafficked areas . faculty and staff should also be involved in conservation education through departmental meetings and have strategies affixed in offices . along with the strategies for achieving energy conservation , energy bills for each building should also be posted . students would finally be able to see the economic cost of energy use . to emphasize the effects of energy consumption and the importance of working towards sustainability , residents should calculate the environmental and social costs based on the energy the building consumed . energy costs should remain posted as a way to compare energy use between months , seasons , and years and used as an indicator of progress . the university of wisconsin-green bay ’ s ( 2005 ) web page on energy conservation stresses the effects of energy consumption on economics and resource depletion , including coal and oil . the web site does not express its concern for the environmental and societal impacts of energy consumption and sends the wrong message to the students reading it . the website should immediately be changed to include the environmental and social consequences ( see fig . 3 ) . global warming fossil fuel burning produces greenhouse gases , carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides ( 25 % increase in atmospheric co2 in the past 150 years ) . leads to atmospheric warming and global climate change - heat waves , droughts , stronger and more frequent hurricanes , rising sea levels and coastal inundation , damaged ecosystems , species extinction , changes in agricultural productivity , migration of tropic diseases northward , etc . air pollution carbon monoxide , nitrogen oxides , sulfur oxides , hydrocarbons , ozone ( smog ) these pollutants can cause bronchitis and pneumonia , irritate the lungs , and cause childhood asthma . nitrogen oxides cause the brown haze seen over many cities . ozone can cause permanent lung damage and reduce crop yields . sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides contribute to acid rain , which causes the death of lakes the world over , including the adirondacks , even remote parts of alaska . water pollution oil spills coal mining - acids run off into waterways and leach into ground water . thermal water pollution - cooling water from thermal power plants kills aquatic life when returned to rivers . land destruction hydropower dams - flood and destroy forestland , native lands , and destroys salmon runs and wildlife migratory routes . strip mining ( coal ) oil drilling and exploration nuclear dependence problem of nuclear waste disposal -- nuclear wastes must be sequestered from the natural environment for 250,000 years . safety issues associated with operation of older nuclear plants which have embrittled piping , pumps , etc . - increasing the possibility of ruptures and leaks and releases radioactive emissions into the air and water possibility of catastrophic meltdown . vulnerability to terrorist attack and massive radioactivity release . costs and impacts associated with nuclear power plant decommissioning . foreign dependence alliances with undemocratic governments in oil exporting countries and resultant human rights violations . risks and costs of fighting oil wars . oil revenues may fund terrorist groups . fig . 3. environmental and social consequences of energy consumption ( ub green , 2005 ) conclusions and recommendations world petroleum production is expected to peak within five years , and natural gas is also in diminishing supply . meanwhile , carbon dioxide , a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion , is contributing to global climate change . the time for action—to develop new renewable energy projects and be ever vigilant for conservation opportunities—is now . we can not afford to wait until a crisis occurs , be it political turmoil in venezuela or the middle east , an unusually harsh winter or some other disruption in fuel supplies , to start to look for energy alternatives . everyone needs to put aside petty criticisms , “ not in my backyard ” issues and other personal motives and embrace the bigger problems facing our planet . the future of the suburban uw- green bay campus depends on bold , concerted action . the 2005 capstone energy group has identified several significant ways to reduce energy consumption and make the campus more sustainable . we recommend that the university : install a utility scale wind turbine to reduce grid-electricity consumption and reduce co2 emissions . install geothermal heating and cooling systems on all new construction . make use of sub-metering on new and remodeled buildings to identify conservation opportunities . be aware and take advantage of incentives , grants and other financial opportunities to reduce the initial costs and payback periods of renewable energy projects . initiate conservation education outreach programs . thank you to all of the people who contributed time and information toward the completion of this project , and we thank the university , in particular , professors michael kraft and kevin fermanich , for the opportunity to work on such an interesting and rewarding project . jackie blohowiak jeff casalina ryuichi iwasaki dustin maas vestas wind systems bibliography alf , mike . “ re : geothermal information . ” email to the author november 16 , 2005. american society of heating , refrigerating and air-conditioning engineers , inc.

executive summary
people have been harnessing the power of the wind for more than 5,000 years . initially used widely for farm irrigation and millworks , today ’ s modern wind turbines produce electricity in more than 70 countries . as of the end of 2008 , there were approximately 120,800 megawatts of wind energy capacity installed around the world ( global wind energy council , 2009 ) . wind energy enjoys considerable public support , but it also has its detractors , who have publicized their concerns that the sounds emitted from wind turbines cause adverse health consequences . in response to those concerns , the american and canadian wind energy associations ( awea and canwea ) established a scientific advisory panel in early 2009 to conduct a review of current literature available on the issue of perceived health effects of wind turbines . this multidisciplinary panel is comprised of medical doctors , audiologists , and acoustical professionals from the united states , canada , denmark , and the united kingdom . the objective of the panel was to provide an authoritative reference document for legislators , regulators , and anyone who wants to make sense of the conflicting information about wind turbine sound . the panel undertook extensive review , analysis , and discussion of the large body of peerreviewed literature on sound and health effects in general , and on sound produced by wind turbines . each panel member contributed a unique expertise in audiology , acoustics , otolaryngology , occupational/ environmental medicine , or public health . with a diversity of perspectives represented , the panel assessed the plausible biological effects of exposure to wind turbine sound . following review , analysis , and discussion of current knowledge , the panel reached consensus on the following conclusions : • • • there is no evidence that the audible or sub-audible sounds emitted by wind turbines have any direct adverse physiological effects . the ground-borne vibrations from wind turbines are too weak to be detected by , or to affect , humans . the sounds emitted by wind turbines are not unique . there is no reason to believe , based on the levels and frequencies of the sounds and the panel ’ s experience with sound exposures in occupational settings , that the sounds from wind turbines could plausibly have direct adverse health consequences .

introduction
the mission of the american wind energy association ( awea ) is to promote the growth of wind power through advocacy , communication , and education . similarly , the mission of the canadian wind energy association ( canwea ) is to promote the responsible and sustainable growth of wind power in canada . both organizations wish to take a proactive role in ensuring that wind energy projects are good neighbors to the communities that have embraced wind energy . together awea and canwea proposed to a number of independent groups that they examine the scientific validity of recent reports on the adverse health effects of wind turbine proximity . such reports have raised public concern about wind turbine exposure . in the absence of declared commitment to such an effort from independent groups , the wind industry decided to be proactive and address the issue itself . in 2009 , awea and canwea commissioned this report . they asked the authors to examine published scientific literature on possible adverse health effects resulting from exposure to wind turbines . the objective of this report is to address health concerns associated with sounds from industrial-scale wind turbines . inevitably , a report funded by an industry association will be subject to charges of bias and conflicts of interest . awea and canwea have minimized bias and conflicts of interest to the greatest possible extent through selection of a distinguished panel of independent experts in acoustics , audiology , medicine , and public health . this report is the result of their efforts .

1.2 report terminology
certain terms are used frequently throughout this report . table 1-1 defines these terms . an understanding of the distinction between “ sound ” and “ noise ” may be particularly useful to the reader .
table 1-1

definitions of acoustical terms
term sound definitions describes wave-like variations in air pressure that occur at frequencies that can stimulate receptors in the inner ear and , if sufficiently powerful , be appreciated at a conscious level . implies the presence of sound but also implies a response to sound : noise is often defined as unwanted sound . the composite of noise from all sources near and far . the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given location . a unit describing the amplitude of sound , equal to 20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the measured pressure to the reference pressure , which is 20 micropascals ( µpa ) . the sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a sound level meter using the a-weighted filter network . the a-weighted filter de-emphasizes the very low and very high frequency components of the sound in a manner similar to the frequency response of the human ear and correlates well with subjective reactions to noise . a unit of measurement of frequency ; the number of cycles per second of a periodic waveform . according to the international electrotechnical commission ’ s ( iec ’ s ) iec 1994 , infrasound is : acoustic oscillations whose frequency is below the lowfrequency limit of audible sound ( about 16 hz ) . however this definition is incomplete as infrasound at high enough levels is audible at frequencies below 16 hz . ( iec ( 1994 ) : 60050-801:1994 international electrotechnical vocabulary chapter 801 : acoustics and electroacoustics ) . low-frequency sound source : hpa , 2009. sound in the frequency range that overlaps the higher infrasound frequencies and the lower audible frequencies , and is typically considered as 10 hz to 200 hz , but is not closely defined .

methodology
three steps form the basis for this report : formation of an expert panel , review of literature directly related to wind turbines , and review of potential environmental exposures .

2.1 formation of expert panel
the american and canadian wind energy associations , awea and canwea , assembled a distinguished panel of independent experts to address concerns that the sounds emitted from wind turbines cause adverse health consequences . the objective of the panel was to provide an authoritative reference document for the use of legislators , regulators , and people simply wanting to make sense of the conflicting information about wind turbine sound . the panel represented expertise in audiology , acoustics , otolaryngology , occupational/ environmental medicine , and public health . a series of conference calls were held among panel members to discuss literature and key health concerns that have been raised about wind turbines . the calls were followed by the development of a draft that was reviewed by other panel members . throughout the follow-up period , literature was critically addressed .

2.2 review of literature directly related to wind turbines
the panel conducted a search of pub med under the heading “ wind turbines and health effects ” to research and address peer-reviewed literature . in addition , the panel conducted a search on “ vibroacoustic disease . ” the reference section identifies the peer and non-peer reviewed sources that were consulted by the panel .

2.3 review of potential environmental exposures
the panel conducted a review of potential environmental exposures associated with wind turbine operations , with a focus on low frequency sound , infrasound , and vibration .

section 3

overview and discussion
this section summarizes the results of the review and analysis conducted by the expert panel and responds to a number of key questions : • • • • • • • how do wind turbine operations affect human auditory response ? how do we determine the loudness and frequency of sound and its effects on the human ear ? how do wind turbines produce sound ? how is sound measured and tested ? what is vibration ? what type of exposure to wind turbines is more likely to be perceived by humans ( low frequency sound , infrasound or vibration ) ? can sounds in the low frequency range , most notably the infrasonic range , adversely affect human health ? even when such levels are below the average person ’ s ability to hear them ? how does the human vestibular system respond to sound ? what are the potential adverse effects and health implications of sound exposure ? what does scientific literature say about wind turbines , low frequency sound , and infrasound ?

3.1 wind turbine operation and human auditory response to sound
3.1.1 overview
the normal operation of a wind turbine produces sound and vibration , arousing concern about potential health implications . this section addresses the fundamental principles associated with sound and vibration , sound measurement , and potential adverse health implications . sound from a wind turbine arises from its mechanical operation and the turning of the blades .

3.1.2 the human ear and sound
the human ear is capable of perceiving a wide range of sounds , from the high-pitched sounds of a bird song to the low-pitched sound of a bass guitar . sounds are perceived based on their loudness ( i.e . , volume or sound pressure level ) or pitch ( i.e . , tonal or frequency content ) . the standard unit of measure for sound pressure levels is the decibel ( db ) . the standard unit used to describe the tonal or frequency content is the hertz ( hz ) , measured in cycles per second ) —appendix a provides more information on the fundamentals of sound . customarily , the young , non-pathological ear can perceive sounds ranging from 20 hz to 20,000 hz . appendix b provides more information on the human ear . frequencies below 20 hz are commonly called “ infrasound , ” although the boundary between infrasound and low frequency sound is not rigid . infrasound , at certain frequencies and at high levels , can be audible to some people . low frequency sound is customarily referred to as that between 10 hz and 200 hz , but any definition is arbitrary to some degree . low frequency sound is the subject of concern to some with respect to potential health implications .

table 3-1 shows sound pressure levels associated with common activities . typically , environmental and occupational sound pressure levels are measured in decibels on an a-weighted scale ( dba ) . the a-weighted scale de-emphasizes the very low and very high frequency components of the sound in a manner similar to the frequency response of the human ear . for comparison , the sound from a wind turbine at distances between 1,000 and 2,000 feet is generally within 40 to 50 dba . section 3.2 discusses the effects of exposure to wind turbine sound . section 3.3 describes the potential adverse effects of sound exposure as well as the health implications .

3.1.3 sound produced by wind turbines
wind turbine sound originates from either a mechanical or aerodynamic generation mechanism . mechanical sound originates from the gearbox and control mechanisms . standard noise control techniques typically are used to reduce mechanical sound . mechanical noise is not typically the dominant source of noise from modern wind turbines ( except for an occasional gear tone ) . the aerodynamic noise is present at all frequencies , from the infrasound range over low frequency sound to the normal audible range and is the dominant source . the aerodynamic noise is generated by several mechanisms as is described below . the aerodynamic noise tends to be modulated in the mid frequency range , approximately 500 to 1,000 hz . aerodynamic sound is produced by the rotation of the turbine blades through the air . a turbine blade shape is that of an airfoil . an airfoil is simply a structure with a shape that produces a lift force when air passes over it . originally developed for aircraft , airfoil shapes have been adapted to provide the turning force for wind turbines by employing a shape which causes the air to travel more rapidly over the top of the airfoil than below it . the designs optimize efficiency by minimizing turbulence , which produces drag and noise . an aerodynamically efficient blade is a quiet one . the aerodynamic sound from wind turbines is caused by the interaction of the turbine blade with the turbulence produced both adjacent to it ( turbulent boundary layer ) and in its near wake ( see figure 3-1 ) ( brooks et al . , 1989 ) . turbulence depends on how fast the blade is moving through the air . a 100-meter-diameter blade , rotating once every three seconds , has a tip velocity of just over 100 meters per second . however , the speed reduces at positions closer to the centre of rotation ( the wind turbine hub ) . the main determinants of the turbulence are the speed of the blade and the shape and dimensions of its cross-section .

figure 3-1

sound produced by wind turbine flow

the following conclusions have been derived from the flow conditions shown in figure 3-1 ( brooks et al . , 1989 ) : • at high velocities for a given blade , turbulent boundary layers develop over much of the airfoil . sound is produced when the turbulent boundary layer passes over the trailing edge . at lower velocities , mainly laminar boundary layers develop , leading to vortex shedding at the trailing edge .

•

other factors in the production of aerodynamic sound include the following : • • • • when the angle of attack is not zero—in other words , the blade is tilted into the wind— flow separation can occur on the suction side near to the trailing edge , producing sound . at high angles of attack , large-scale separation may occur in a stall condition , leading to radiation of low frequency sound . a blunt trailing edge leads to vortex shedding and additional sound . the tip vortex contains highly turbulent flow .

each of the above factors may contribute to wind turbine sound production . measurements of the location of the sound source in wind turbines indicate that the dominant sound is produced along the blade—nearer to the tip end than to the hub . reduction of turbulence sound can be facilitated through airfoil shape and by good maintenance . for example , surface irregularities resulting from damage or to accretion of additional material , may increase the sound .

3-4

wind turbine sound and health effects an expert panel review

aerodynamic sound has been shown to be generated at higher levels during the downward motion of the blade ( i.e . , the three o ’ clock position ) . this results in a rise in level of approximately once per second for a typical three-bladed turbine . this periodic rise in level is also referred to as amplitude modulation , and as described above for a typical wind turbine , the modulation frequency is 1 hz ( once per second ) . in other words , the sound level rises and falls about once per second . the origin of this amplitude modulation is not fully understood . it was previously assumed that the modulation was caused when the blade went past the tower ( given the tower disturbed the airflow ) , but it is now thought to be related to the difference in wind speed between the top and bottom of the rotation of a blade and directivity of the aerodynamic noise ( oerlemans and schepers , 2009 ) . in other words , the result of aerodynamic modulation is a perceivable fluctuation in the sound level of approximately once per second . the frequency content of this fluctuating sound is typically between 500 hz and 1,000 hz , but can occur at higher and lower frequencies . that is , the sound pressure levels between approximately 500 and 1,000 hz will rise and fall approximately once per second . it should be noted , however , that the magnitude of the amplitude modulation that is observed when standing beneath a tower does not always occur at greater separation distances . a study in the united kingdom ( uk ) also showed that only four out of about 130 wind farms had a problem with aerodynamic modulation and three of these have been solved ( moorhouse et al . , 2007 ) . in addition to the sound levels generated by the turbines , environmental factors affect the levels received at more distant locations . for example , warm air near the ground causes the turbine sound to curve upwards , away from the ground , which results in reduced sound levels , while warm air in a temperature inversion may cause the sound to curve down to the earth resulting in increased sound levels . wind may also cause the sound level to be greater downwind of the turbine—that is , if the wind is blowing from the source towards a receiver—or lower , if the wind is blowing from the receiver to the source . most modeling techniques , when properly implemented , account for moderate inversions and downwind conditions . attenuation ( reduction ) of sound can also be influenced by barriers , ground surface conditions , shrubbery and trees , among other things . predictions of the sound level at varying distances from the turbine are based on turbine sound power levels . these turbine sound power levels are determined through standardized measurement methods .

3.1.4 sound measurement and audiometric testing
a sound level meter is a standard tool used in the measurement of sound pressure levels . as described in section 3.1.2 , the standard unit of sound pressure level ( i.e . , volume ) is db and the standard unit used to describe the pitch or frequency is hz ( cycles per second ) . a sound level meter may use the a-weighting filter to adjust certain frequency ranges ( those that humans detect poorly ) , resulting in a reading in dba ( decibels , a-weighted ) . appendix c provides more information on the measurement of sound . the pitch or frequencies ( sometimes referred to as sound level spectrum ) can be quantified using a sound level meter that includes a frequency analyzer . octave band , one-third octave band , and narrow band ( such as fast fourier transform , or fft ) are three common types of frequency analyzers .

consider , for example , a routine audiometric test ( hearing test ) in which a person sits in a booth and wears headphones , through which sounds are transmitted to evaluate hearing . outside the booth , a technician turns a dial which yields certain frequencies ( for example , 125 hz , a low-pitched sound , or 4,000 hz , a high-pitched sound ) and then the technician raises the volume of each frequency until the person recognizes the sound of each tone . this is a standard approach used to measure thresholds for many reasons , including noiseinduced hearing loss ( nihl ) . as the technician raises the volume of the designated frequency , the sound level ( in db ) is noted . people who need more than 25 db at more than one frequency to hear the sound ( ie loudness of the tone ) are considered to have an abnormal test . the effects of prolonged , high-level sound exposure on hearing have been determined through audiometric tests of workers in certain occupations . the studies have been published in major medical journals and subjected to the peer review process ( see , for example , mccunney and meyer , 2007 ) . studies of workers have also served as the scientific basis for regulations on noise in industry that are overseen by the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) . workers in noise-intensive industries have been evaluated for nihl and certain industries are known to be associated with high noise levels , such as aviation , construction , and areas of manufacturing such as canning . multiyear worker studies suggest that prolonged exposure to high noise levels can adversely affect hearing . the levels considered sufficiently high to cause hearing loss are considerably higher than one could experience in the vicinity of wind turbines . for example , prolonged , unprotected high exposure to noise at levels greater than 90 dba is a risk for hearing loss in occupational settings such that osha established this level for hearing protection . sound levels from wind turbines do not approach these levels ( 50 dba at a distance of 1,500 feet would be a conservative estimate for today ’ s turbines ) . although the issue of nihl has rarely been raised in opposition to wind farms , it is important to note that the risk of nihl is directly dependent on the intensity ( sound level ) and duration of noise exposure and therefore it is reasonable to conclude that there is no risk of nihl from wind turbine sound . such a conclusion is based on studies of workers exposed to noise and among whom risk of nihl is not apparent at levels less than 75 dba .

3.2 sound exposure from wind turbine operation
this section addresses the questions of ( 1 ) whether sounds in the low frequency range , most notably the infrasonic range , adversely affect human health , and whether they do so even when such levels are below the average person ’ s ability to hear them ; ( 2 ) what we are referring to when we talk about vibration ; and ( 3 ) how the human vestibular system responds to sound and disturbance .

3.2.1 infrasound and low-frequency sound
infrasound and low frequency sound are addressed in some detail to offer perspective on publicized hypotheses that sound from a wind turbine may damage health even if the noise levels are below those associated with noise-induced hearing loss in industry . for example , it has been proposed that sounds that contain low frequency noise , most notably within the infrasonic level , can adversely affect health even when the levels are below the average person ’ s ability to detect or hear them ( alves-pereira and branco , 2007b ) .

wind turbine sound and health effects an expert panel review

comprehensive reviews of infrasound and its sources and measurement have been published ( berglund and lindvall , 1995 ; leventhall et al . , 2003 ) . table 3-2 shows the sound pressure level , in decibels , of the corresponding frequency of infrasound and low frequency sound necessary for the sound to be heard by the average person ( leventhall et al . , 2003 ) .

note : average hearing thresholds ( for young healthy people ) in the infrasound ( 4 to 20 hz ) and low frequency region ( 10 to 200 hz ) . source : leventhall et al . , 2003

as table 3-2 indicates , at low frequencies , a much higher level sound is necessary for a sound to be heard in comparison to higher frequencies . for example , at 10 hz , the sound must be at 97 db to be audible . if this level occurred at the mid to high frequencies , which the ear detects effectively , it would be roughly equivalent to standing without hearing protection directly next to a power saw . decibel for decibel , the low frequencies are much more difficult to detect than the high frequencies , as shown in the hearing threshold levels of table 3-2. table 3-2 also shows that even sounds as low as 4 hz can be heard if the levels are high enough ( 107 db ) . however , levels from wind turbines at 4 hz are more likely to be around 70 db or lower , and therefore inaudible . studies conducted to assess wind turbine noise have shown that wind turbine sound at typical distances does not exceed the hearing threshold and will not be audible below about 50 hz ( hayes 2006b ; kamperman and james , 2008 ) . the hearing threshold level at 50 hz is 44 db , as shown in table 3-2. recent work on evaluating a large number of noise sources between 10 hz and 160 hz suggests that wind turbine noise heard indoors at typical separation distances is modest on the scale of low frequency sound sources ( pedersen , 2008 ) . the low levels of infrasound and low frequency sound from wind turbine operations have been confirmed by others ( jakobsen , 2004 ; van den berg , 2004 ) . the low frequency sound associated with wind turbines has attracted attention recently since the a-weighting scale that is used for occupational and environmental regulatory compliance does not work well with sounds that have prominently low frequency components . most environmental low frequency sound problems are caused by discrete tones ( pitch or tones that are significantly higher in level ( volume ) than the neighboring frequencies ) ; from , for example , an engine or compressor , not by continuous broadband sound . the high frequency sounds are assessed by the a-weighted measurement and , given their shorter wavelengths , are controlled more readily . low frequency sounds may be irritating to some people and , in fact , some low frequency sound complaints prove impossible to resolve ( leventhall et al . , 2003 ) . this observation leads to a perception that there is something special , sinister , and harmful about low frequency sound . to the contrary , most external sound when heard indoors is biased towards low frequencies due to the efficient building attenuation of higher frequencies . one may recognize this when noise

from a neighbor ’ s stereo is heard within their home—the bass notes are more pronounced than the higher frequency sounds . any unwanted sound , whether high frequency or low frequency , can be irritating and stressful to some people . differences in how a low frequency sound and high frequency sound are perceived are well documented . figure 3-2 shows that lower-frequency sounds typically need to be at a high sound pressure level ( db ) to be heard . figure 3-2 also demonstrates that as the frequency lowers , the audible range is compressed leading to a more rapid rise in loudness as the level changes in the lower frequencies . at 1,000 hz , the whole range covers about 100 db change in sound pressure level , while at 20 hz the same range of loudness covers about 50 db ( note the contours displayed in figure 3-2 are in terms of phons , a measure of equal loudness ; for additional explanation on phons , the reader is referred to http : //www.sfu.ca/sonicstudio/handbook/phon.html [ truax , 1999 ] ) . as the annoyance of a given sound increases as loudness increases , there is also a more rapid growth of annoyance at low frequencies . however , there is no evidence for direct physiological effects from either infrasound or low frequency sound at the levels generated from wind turbines , indoors or outside . effects may result from the sounds being audible , but these are similar to the effects from other audible sounds . low frequency sound and infrasound are further addressed in section 3.3 , potential adverse effects of exposure to sound .

3.2.2 vibration
vibration , assumed to result from inaudible low frequency sounds , has been postulated to have a potential adverse effect on health . this section defines vibration , describes how it is measured , and cites studies that have addressed the risk of vibration on health . vibration refers to the way in which energy travels through solid material , whether steel , concrete in a bridge , the earth , the wall of a house or the human body . vibration is distinguished from sound , which is energy flowing through gases ( like air ) or liquids ( like water ) . as higher frequency vibrations attenuate rapidly , it is low frequencies which are of potential concern to human health . when vibration is detected through the feet or through the seat , the focus of interest is the vibration of the surface with which one is in contact—for example , when travelling in a vehicle . vibration is often measured by the acceleration of the surface in meters per second , squared ( m/s2 ) , although other related units are used . vibration can also be expressed in decibels , where the reference excitation level used in buildings is often 10–5m/s2 and the vibration level is 20log ( a/10-5 ) db , where a is the acceleration level in m/s2 . the threshold of perception of vibration by humans is approximately 0.01 m/s2 . if a frequency of excitation ( vibration ) corresponds with a resonant frequency of a system , then

3-9

wind turbine sound and health effects an expert panel review

excitation at the resonant frequency is greater than at other frequencies . however , excitation by sound is not the same as excitation by mechanical excitation applied at , say , the feet . figure 3-3 shows an object excited by point mechanical vibration and by sound . the object contains a resiliently suspended system . for example , if the object was the body , the suspended system might be the viscera ( internal organs of the body ) . the left hand of the figure can be interpreted as the body vibrated by input to the feet . the vibration of the viscera will be maximum at the resonant frequency1 of the suspended system , which , for viscera , is about 4 hz . when excitation is by long wavelength low frequency sound waves , as shown at the right of the figure , not only is the force acting on the body much smaller than for vibration input , but , as the wavelength is much greater than the dimensions of the body , it is acting around the body in a compressive manner so that there is no resultant force on the suspended system and it does not vibrate or resonate .
figure 3-3

comparison of excitation of an object by vibration and by sound

unfortunately , this lack of effect has not been addressed by those who have suggested the mechanical vibration response of the body instead of the acoustic response as a potential health consequence . this oversight has led to inaccurate conclusions . for example , dr. nina pierpont bases one of her key hypotheses for the cause of “ wind turbine syndrome ” on such an egregious error ( pierpont , 2009 , pre-publication draft ) . although not a recognized medical diagnosis , “ wind turbine syndrome ” has been raised as a concern for proposed projects—refer to section 4.3 for more information . vibration of the body by sound at one of its resonant frequencies occurs only at very high sound levels and is not a factor in the perception of wind turbine noise . as will be discussed

1 a common example of resonance is pushing a child on a swing in which energy is given to the swing to maximize its oscillation .

the vestibular system of the body plays a major role in maintaining a person ’ s sense of balance and the stabilization of visual images . the vestibular system responds to pressure changes ( sound pressure , i.e . , decibels ) at various frequencies . at high levels of exposure to low frequency sound , nausea and changes in respiration and blood pressure may occur . studies have shown , however , that for these effects to occur , considerably high noise levels ( greater than 140 db , similar in sound level of a jet aircraft heard 80 feet away ) are necessary ( berglund et al . , 1996 ) . head vibration resulting from low frequency sound has been suggested as a possible cause of a variety of symptoms that some hypothesize as being associated with wind turbines . in order to properly assess this hypothesis , this section addresses the human vestibular system . the “ vestibular system ” comprises the sense organs in the vestibular labyrinth , in which there are five tiny sensory organs : three semicircular canals that detect head rotation and two chalk-crystal-studded organs called otoliths ( literally “ ear-stones ” ) that detect tilt and linear motion of the head . all five organs contain hair cells , like those in the cochlea , that convert motion into nerve impulses traveling to the brain in the vestibular nerve . these organs evolved millions of years before the middle ear . fish , for example , have no middle ear or cochlea but have a vestibular labyrinth nearly identical to ours ( baloh and honrubia , 1979 ) . the vestibular organs are specialized for stimulation by head position and movement , not by airborne sound . each vestibular organ is firmly attached to the skull , to enable them to respond to the slightest head movement . in contrast , the hair cells in the cochlea are not directly attached to the skull ; they do not normally respond to head movement , but to movements of the inner ear fluids . the otolith organs help fish hear low frequency sounds ; even in primates , these organs will respond to head vibration ( i.e . , bone-conducted sound ) at frequencies up to 500 hz ( fernandez and goldberg , 1976 ) . these vibratory responses of the vestibular system can be elicited by airborne sounds , however , only when they are at a much higher level than normal hearing thresholds2 ( and much higher than levels associated with wind turbine exposure ) . thus , they do not help us hear but appear to be vestiges of our evolutionary past . the vestibular nerve sends information about head position and movement to centers in the brain that also receive input from the eyes and from stretch receptors in the neck , trunk , and
2 young et al . ( 1977 ) found that neurons coming from the vestibular labyrinth of monkeys responded to head vibration at frequencies of 200-400 hz , and at levels as low as 70 to 80 db below gravitational force . however , these neurons could not respond to airborne sound at the same frequencies until levels exceeded 76 db sound pressure level ( spl ) , which is at least 40 db higher than the normal threshold of human hearing in this frequency range . human eye movements respond to 100 hz head vibration at levels 15 db below audible levels ( todd et al . , 2008a ) . this does not mean that the vestibular labyrinth is more sensitive than the cochlea to airborne sound , because the impedance-matching function of the middle ear allows the cochlea to respond to sounds that are 50-60 db less intense than those necessary to cause detectable head vibration . indeed , the same authors ( todd et al . , 2008b ) found that for airborne sound , responses from the cochlea could always be elicited by sounds that were below the threshold for vestibular responses . similarly , welgampola et al . ( 2003 ) found that thresholds for vestibular evoked myogenic potential response ( vemp ) were higher than hearing thresholds and stated : “ the difference between hearing thresholds and vemp thresholds is much greater for air conducted sounds than for bone vibration . ” in other words , the vestigial vestibular response to sound is relatively sensitive to bone conduction , which involves vibration of the whole head , and much less sensitive to air conduction .

legs ( these stretch receptors tell which muscles are contracted and which joints are flexed , and provide the “ proprioceptive ” sense of the body ’ s position and orientation in space ) . the brain integrates vestibular , visual , and proprioceptive inputs into a comprehensive analysis of the position and movement of the head and body , essential for the sense of balance , avoidance of falls , and keeping the eyes focused on relevant targets , even during movement . perception of the body ’ s position in space may also rely in part on input from receptors in abdominal organs ( which can shift back and forth as the body tilts ) and from pressure receptors in large blood vessels ( blood pools in the legs when standing , then shifts back to the trunk when lying down ) . these “ somatic graviceptors ” ( mittelstaedt , 1996 ) could be activated by whole-body movement and possibly by structure-borne vibration , or by the blast of a powerful near explosion , but , as described in section 4.3.2 , it is unlikely that intraabdominal and intra-thoracic organs and blood vessels could detect airborne sound like that created by wind turbines . trauma , toxins , age-related degeneration , and various ear diseases can cause disorders of the vestibular labyrinth . a labyrinth not functioning properly can cause a person to feel unsteady or even to fall . since the semicircular canals of the ear normally detect head rotation ( such as shaking the head to indicate “ no ” ) , one of the consequences of a dysfunctional canal is that a person may feel a “ spinning ” sensation . this reaction is described as vertigo , from the latin word to turn . in normal conversation , words like vertigo and dizziness can be used in ambiguous ways and thus make careful interpretation of potential health claims problematic . “ dizzy , ” for example , may mean true vertigo or unsteadiness , both of which may be symptoms of inner ear disease . a person who describes being ” dizzy ” may actually be experiencing light-headedness , a fainting sensation , blurred vision , disorientation , or almost any other difficult-to-describe sensation in the head . the word “ dizziness ” can represent different sensations to each person , with a variety of causes . this can make the proper interpretation of research studies in which dizziness is evaluated a challenge to interpret . proper diagnostic testing to evaluate dizziness can reduce errors in misclassifying disease . the vestibular labyrinth , for example , can be tested for postural stability . information from the semicircular canals is fed to the eye muscles to allow us to keep our eyes focused on a target ; when the head moves ; this “ vestibulo-ocular reflex ” is easily tested and can be impaired in vestibular disorders ( baloh and honrubia , 1979 ) .

3.3 potential adverse effects of exposure to sound
adverse effects of sound are directly dependent on the sound level ; higher frequency sounds present a greater risk of an adverse effect than lower levels ( see table 3-2 ) . speech interference , hearing loss , and task interference occur at high sound levels . softer sounds may be annoying or cause sleep disturbance in some people . at normal separation distances , wind turbines do not produce sound at levels that cause speech interference , but some people may find these sounds to be annoying .

3.3.1 speech interference
it is common knowledge that conversation can be difficult in a noisy restaurant ; the louder the background noise , the louder we talk and the harder it is to communicate . average

3-12

wind turbine sound and health effects an expert panel review

levels of casual conversation at 1 meter ( arm ’ s length ) are typically 50 to 60 dba . people raise their voices—slightly and unconsciously at first—when ambient levels exceed 50 to 55 dba , in order to keep speech levels slightly above background noise levels . communication at arm ’ s length requires conscious extra effort when levels exceed about 75 dba . above ambient levels of 80 to 85 dba , people need to shout or get closer to converse ( pearsons et al . , 1977 ; webster , 1978 ) . levels below 45 dba can be considered irrelevant with respect to speech interference .

3.3.2 noise-induced hearing loss
very brief and intense sounds ( above 130 dba , such as in explosions ) can cause instant cochlear damage and permanent hearing loss , but most occupational nihl results from prolonged exposure to high noise levels between 90 and 105 dba ( mccunney and meyer 2007 ) . regulatory ( osha , 1983 ) and advisory ( niosh , 1998 ) authorities in the u.s. concur that risk of nihl begins at about 85 dba , for an 8-hour day , over a 40-year career . levels below 75 dba do not pose a risk of nihl . thus , the sound levels associated with wind turbine operations would not cause nihl because they are not high enough .

3.3.3 task interference
suter ( 1991 ) reviewed the effects of noise on performance and behavior . simple tasks may be unaffected even at levels well above 100 dba , while more complex tasks can be disrupted by intermittent noise as low as 75 dba . speech sounds are usually more disruptive than nonspeech sounds . levels below 70 dba do not result in task interference .

3.3.4 annoyance
annoyance as a possible “ effect ” of wind turbine operations is discussed in detail in later sections of this report ( sections 3.4 and 4.1 ) . in summary , annoyance is a subjective response that varies among people to many types of sounds . it is important to note that although annoyance may be a frustrating experience for people , it is not considered an adverse health effect or disease of any kind . certain everyday sounds , such as a dripping faucet—barely audible—can be annoying . annoyance can not be predicted easily with a sound level meter . noise from airports , road traffic , and other sources ( including wind turbines ) may annoy some people , and , as described in section 4.1 , the louder the noise , the more people may become annoyed .

3.3.5 sleep disturbance
the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) document titled information on levels of environmental noise requisite to protect public health and welfare with an adequate margin of safety ( 1974 ) recommends that indoor day-night-level ( dnl ) not exceed 45 dba . dnl is a 24-hour average that gives 10 db extra weight to sounds occurring between 10p.m . and 7 a.m. , on the assumption that during these sleep hours , levels above 35 dba indoors may be disruptive .

3.3.6 other adverse health effects of sound
at extremely high sound levels , such as those associated with explosions , the resulting sound pressure can injure any air-containing organ : not only the middle ear ( eardrum

perforations are common ) but also the lungs and intestines ( sasser et al . , 2006 ) . at the other extreme , any sound that is chronically annoying , including very soft sounds , may , for some people , create chronic stress , which can in turn lead to other health problems . on the other hand , many people become accustomed to regular exposure to noise or other potential stressors , and are no longer annoyed . the hypothesis that chronic noise exposure might lead to chronic health problems such as hypertension and heart disease has been the subject of hundreds of contradictory studies of highly variable quality , which will not be reviewed in this document . other authors have reviewed this literature , and some of their conclusions are quoted below : “ it appears not likely that noise in industry can be a direct cause of general health problems… , except that the noise can create conditions of psychological stress…which can in turn cause physiological stress reactions… ” ( kryter , 1980 ) “ epidemiological evidence on noise exposure , blood pressure , and ischemic heart disease is still limited . ” ( babisch , 2004 ) , and “ contradictory ’ ( babisch , 1998 ) , but “ there is some evidence…of an increased risk in subjects who live in noisy areas with outdoor noise levels of greater than 65 - 70 dba . ” ( babisch , 2000 ) “ the present state of the art does not permit any definite conclusion to be drawn about the risk of hypertension . ” ( van dijk , ettema , and zielhuis , 1987 ) “ at this point , the relationship between noise induced hearing loss and hypertension must be considered as possible but lacking sufficient evidence to draw causal associations . '' ( mccunney and meyer , 2007 )

3.3.7 potential health effects of vibration exposure
people may experience vibration when some part of the body is in direct contact with a vibrating object . one example would be holding a chainsaw or pneumatic hammer in the hands . another would be sitting in a bus , truck , or on heavy equipment such as a bulldozer . chronic use of vibrating tools can cause “ hand-arm vibration syndrome , ” a vascular insufficiency condition characterized by numbness and tingling of the fingers , cold intolerance , “ white-finger ” attacks , and eventually even loss of fingers due to inadequate blood supply . osha does not set limits for vibration exposure , but the american national standards institute ( ansi ) ( 2006 ) recommends that 8-hour workday exposures to hand-arm vibration ( 5 to 1400 hz , summed over three orthogonal axes of movement ) not exceed acceleration values of 2.5 m/s2 . excessive whole-body vibration is clearly linked to low back pain ( wilder , wasserman , and wasserman , 2002 ) and may contribute to gastrointestinal and urinary disorders , although these associations are not well established . ansi ( 1979 ) recommends 8-hour limits for whole-body vibration of 0.3 m/s2 , for the body ’ s most sensitive frequency range of 4 to 8 hz . this is about 30 times more intense than the weakest vibration that people can detect ( 0.01 m/s2 ) . airborne sound can cause detectable body vibration , but this occurs only at very high levels—usually above sound pressure levels of 100 db ( unweighted ) ( smith , 2002 ; takahashi et al . , 2005 ; yamada et al . , 1983 ) . there is no scientific evidence to suggest that modern wind turbines cause perceptible vibration in homes or that there is an associated health risk .

3.4 peer-reviewed literature focusing on wind turbines , low-frequency sound , and infrasound
this section addresses the scientific review of the literature that has evaluated wind turbines , the annoyance effect , low frequency sound , and infrasound .

3.4.1 evaluation of annoyance and dose-response relationship of wind turbine sound
to date , three studies in europe have specifically evaluated potential health effects of people living in proximity to wind turbines ( pedersen and persson waye , 2004 ; pedersen and persson waye , 2007 ; pedersen et al . , 2009 ) . these studies have been primarily in sweden and the netherlands . customarily , an eligible group of people are selected for possible participation in the study based on their location with respect to a wind turbine . control groups have not been included in any of these reports . in an article published in august 2009 , investigators reported the results of their evaluation of 725 people in the netherlands , who lived in the vicinity of wind turbines ( pedersen et al . , 2009 ) . the potential study population consisted of approximately 70,000 people living within 2.5 kilometers of a wind turbine at selected sites in the netherlands . the objective of the study was to ( 1 ) assess the relationship between wind turbine sound levels at dwellings and the probability of noise annoyance , taking into account possible moderating factors , and ( 2 ) explore the possibility of generalizing a dose response relationship for wind turbine noise by comparing the results of the study with previous studies in sweden . noise impact was quantified based on the relationship between the sound level ( dose ) and response with the latter measured as the proportion of people annoyed or highly annoyed by sound . prior to this study , dose response curves had been modeled for wind turbines . previous studies have noted different degrees of relationships between wind turbine sound levels and annoyance ( wolsink et al . , 1993 ; pedersen and persson waye , 2004 ; pedersen and persson waye , 2007 ) . subjective responses were obtained through a survey . the calculation of the sound levels ( dose ) in sweden and the netherlands were similar . a dose response relationship was observed between calculated a-weighted sound pressure levels and annoyance . sounds from wind turbines were found to be more annoying than several other environmental sources at comparable sound levels . a strong correlation was also noted between noise annoyance and negative opinion of the impact of wind turbines on the landscape , a finding in earlier studies as well . the dominant quality of the sound was a swishing , the quality previously found to be the most annoying type . the authors concluded that this study could be used for calculating a dose response curve for wind turbine sound and annoyance . the study results suggest that wind turbine sound is easily perceived and , compared with sound from other sources , is annoying to a small percentage of people ( 5 percent at 35 to 40 dba ) . in this study , the proportion of people who reported being annoyed by wind turbine noise was similar to merged data from two previous swedish studies ( pederson and persson

waye , 2004 ; pedersen and persson waye , 2007 ) . about 5 percent of respondents were annoyed at noise levels between 35 to 40 dba and 18 percent at 40 to 45 dba . pedersen et al . also reported significant dose responses between wind turbine sound and self-reported annoyance ( pedersen and persson waye , 2004 ) . high exposed individuals responded more ( 78 percent ) than low exposed individuals ( 60 percent ) , which suggests that bias could have played a role in the final results . an analysis of two cross-sectional socio-acoustic studies—one that addressed flat landscapes in mainly rural settings ( pedersen and persson waye , 2004 ) and another in different terrains ( complex or flat ) and different levels of urbanization ( rural or suburban ) ( pedersen and persson waye , 2007 ) —was performed ( pedersen , 2008 ) . approximately 10 percent of over 1000 people surveyed via a questionnaire reported being very annoyed at sound levels of 40 db and greater . attitude toward the visual impact of the wind turbines had the same effect on annoyance . response to wind turbine noise was significantly related to exposure expressed as a-weighted sound pressure levels db . among those who could hear wind turbine sound , annoyance with wind turbine noise was highly correlated to the sound characteristics : swishing , whistling , resounding and pulsating/throbbing ( pedersen , 2008 ) . a similar study in sweden evaluated 754 people living near one of seven sites where wind turbine power was greater than 500 kilowatt ( kw ) ( pedersen and persson waye , 2007 ) . annoyance was correlated with sound level and also with negative attitude toward the visual impact of the wind turbines . note that none of these studies included a control group . earlier field studies performed among people living in the vicinity of wind turbines showed a correlation between sound pressure level and noise annoyance ; however , annoyance was also influenced by visual factors and attitudes toward the impact of the wind turbines on the landscape . noise annoyance was noted at lower sound pressure levels than annoyance from traffic noise . although some people may be affected by annoyance , there is no scientific evidence that noise at levels created by wind turbines could cause health problems ( pedersen and högskolan , 2003 ) .

3.4.2 annoyance
a feeling described as “ annoyance ” can be associated with acoustic factors such as wind turbine noise . there is considerable variability , however , in how people become “ annoyed ” by environmental factors such as road construction and aviation noise , among others ( leventhall , 2004 ) . annoyance is clearly a subjective effect that will vary among people and circumstances . in extreme cases , sleep disturbance may occur . wind speed at the hub height of a wind turbine at night may be up to twice as high as during the day and may lead to annoyance from the amplitude modulated sound of the wind turbine ( van den berg , 2003 ) . however , in a study of 16 sites in 3 european countries , only a weak correlation was noted between sound pressure level and noise annoyance from wind turbines ( pedersen and högskolan , 2003 ) . in a detailed comparison of the role of noise sensitivity in response to environmental noise around international airports in sydney , london , and amsterdam , it was shown that noise sensitivity increases one ’ s perception of annoyance independently of the level of noise exposure ( van kamp et al . , 2004 ) .

3-16

wind turbine sound and health effects an expert panel review

in a swedish study , 84 out of 1,095 people living in the vicinity of a wind turbine in 12 geographical areas reported being fairly or very annoyed by wind turbines ( pedersen , 2008 ) . it is important to note that no differences were reported among people who were “ annoyed ” in contrast to those who were not annoyed with respect to hearing impairment , diabetes , or cardiovascular disease . an earlier study in sweden showed that the proportion of people “ annoyed ” by wind turbine sound is higher than for other sources of environmental noise at the same decibel level ( pedersen and persson waye , 2004 ) .

3.4.3 low-frequency sound and infrasound
no scientific studies have specifically evaluated health effects from exposure to low frequency sound from wind turbines . natural sources of low frequency sound include wind , rivers , and waterfalls in both audible and non-audible frequencies . other sources include road traffic , aircraft , and industrial machinery . the most common source of infrasound is vehicular ( national toxicology program , 2001 ) . infrasound at a frequency of 20 hz ( the upper limit of infrasound ) is not detectable at levels lower than than 79 db ( leventhall et al . , 2003 ) . infrasound at 145 db at 20 hz and at 165 db at 2 hz can stimulate the auditory system and cause severe pain ( leventhall , 2006 ) .these noise levels are substantially higher than any noise generated by wind turbines . the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) has approved the use of infrasound for therapeutic massage at 70 db in the 8 to 14 hz range ( national toxicology program , 2001 ) . in light of the fda approval for this type of therapeutic use of infrasound , it is reasonable to conclude that exposure to infrasound in the 70 db range is safe . according to a report of the national research council ( nrc ) , low frequency sound is a concern for older wind turbines but not the modern type ( national research council , 2007 ) .

section 4

results
this section discusses the results of the anaylsis presented in section 3. potential effects from infrasound , low frequency sound , and the fluctuating aerodynamic “ swish ” from turbine blades are examined . proposed hypotheses between wind turbine sound and physiological effects in the form of vibroacoustic disease , “ wind turbine syndrome , ” and visceral vibratory vestibular disturbance are discussed .

4.1 infrasound , low-frequency sound , and annoyance
sound levels from wind turbines pose no risk of hearing loss or any other nonauditory effect . in fact , a recent review concluded that “ occupational noise-induced hearing damage does not occur below levels of 85 dba . ” ( ising and kruppa , 2004 ) the levels of sound associated with wind turbine operations are considerably lower than industry levels associated with noise induced hearing loss . however , some people attribute certain health problems to wind turbine exposure . to make sense of these assertions , one must consider not only the sound but the complex factors that may lead to the perception of “ annoyance . ” most health complaints regarding wind turbines have centered on sound as the cause . there are two types of sounds from wind turbines : mechanical sound , which originates from the gearbox and control mechanisms , and the more dominant aerodynamical sound , which is present at all frequencies from the infrasound range over low frequency sound to the normal audible range . infrasound from natural sources ( for example , ocean waves and wind ) surrounds us and is below the audible threshold . the infrasound emitted from wind turbines is at a level of 50 to 70 db , sometimes higher , but well below the audible threshold . there is a consensus among acoustic experts that the infrasound from wind turbines is of no consequence to health . one particular problem with many of these assertions about infrasound is that is that the term is often misused when the concerning sound is actually low frequency sound , not infrasound . under many conditions , low frequency sound below about 40 hz can not be distinguished from environmental background sound from the wind itself . perceptible ( meaning above both the background sound and the hearing threshold ) , low frequency sound can be produced by wind turbines under conditions of unusually turbulent wind conditions , but the actual sound level depends on the distance of the listener from the turbine , as the sound attenuates ( falls off ) with distance . the higher the frequency , the greater the sound attenuates with distance—appendix d provides more information on the propagation of sound . the low frequency sound emitted by spinning wind turbines could possibly be annoying to some when winds are unusually turbulent , but there is no evidence that this level of sound could be harmful to health . if so , city dwelling would be impossible due to the similar levels of ambient sound levels normally present in urban environments . nevertheless , a small number of people find city sound levels stressful .

4-1

wind turbine sound and health effects an expert panel review

it is not usually the low frequency nonfluctuating sound component , however , that provokes complaints about wind turbine sound . the fluctuating aerodynamic sound ( swish ) in the 500 to 1,000 hz range occurs from the wind turbine blades disturbing the air , modulated as the blades rotate which changes the sound dispersion characteristics in an audible manner . this fluctuating aerodynamic sound is the cause of most sound complaints regarding wind turbines , as it is harder to become accustomed to fluctuating sound than to sound that does not fluctuate . however , this fluctuation does not always occur and a uk study showed that it had been a problem in only four out of 130 uk wind farms , and had been resolved in three of those ( moorhouse et al . , 2007 ) .

4.1.1 infrasound and low-frequency sound
infrasound occurs at frequencies less than 20 hz . at low and inaudible levels , infrasound has been suggested as a cause of “ wind turbine syndrome ” and vibroacoustic disease ( vad ) —refer to section 4.2.1 for more information on vad . for infrasound to be heard , high sound levels are necessary ( see section 3 , table 3-2 ) . there is little risk of short term acute exposure to high levels of infrasound . in experiments related to the apollo space program , subjects were exposed to between 120 and 140 db without known harmful effects . high level infrasound is less harmful than the same high levels of sound in the normal audible frequency range . high levels of low frequency sound can excite body vibrations ( leventhall , 2003 ) . early attention to low frequency sound was directed to the u.s. space program , studies from which suggested that 24-hour exposures to 120 to 130 db are tolerable below 20 hz , the upper limit of infrasound . modern wind turbines produce sound that is assessed as infrasound at typical levels of 50 to 70 db , below the hearing threshold at those frequencies ( jakobsen , 2004 ) . jakobsen concluded that infrasound from wind turbines does not present a health concern . fluctuations of wind turbine sound , most notably the swish-swish sounds , are in the frequency range of 500 to 1,000 hz , which is neither low frequency sound nor infrasound . the predominant sound from wind turbines , however , is often mischaracterized as infrasound and low frequency sound . levels of infrasound near modern-scale wind farms are in general not perceptible to people . in the human body , the beat of the heart is at 1 to 2 hz . higher-frequency heart sounds measured externally to the body are in the low frequency range ( 27 to 35 db at 20 to 40 hz ) , although the strongest frequency is that of the heartbeat ( sakai , feigen , and luisada , 1971 ) . lung sounds , measured externally to the body are in the range of 5 to 35 db at 150 to 600 hz ( fiz et al . , 2008 ) . schust ( 2004 ) has given a comprehensive review of the effects of high level low frequency sound , up to 100 hz .

4.1.2 annoyance
annoyance is a broad topic on which volumes have been written . annoyance can be caused by constant amplitude and amplitude modulated sounds containing rumble ( bradley , 1994 ) . as the level of sound rises , an increasing number of those who hear it may become distressed , until eventually nearly everybody is affected , although to different degrees . this is a clear and easily understood process . however , what is not so clearly understood is that when the level of the sound reduces , so that very few people are troubled by it , there remain a small number who may be adversely affected . this occurs at all frequencies , although there seems to be more subjective variability at the lower frequencies . the effect of low

4-2

wind turbine sound and health effects an expert panel review

frequency sound on annoyance has recently been reviewed ( leventhall , 2004 ) . the standard deviation of the hearing threshold is approximately 6 db at low frequencies ( kurakata and mizunami , 2008 ) , so that about 2.5 percent of the population will have 12 db more sensitive hearing than the average person . however , hearing sensitivity alone does not appear to be the deciding factor with respect to annoyance . for example , the same type of sound may elicit different reactions among people : one person might say “ yes , i can hear the sound , but it does not bother me , ” while another may say , “ the sound is impossible , it is ruining my life . ” there is no evidence of harmful effects from the low levels of sound from wind turbines , as experienced by people in their homes . studies have shown that peoples ’ attitudes toward wind turbines may affect the level of annoyance that they report ( pedersen et al . , 2009 ) . some authors emphasize the psychological effects of sounds ( kalveram , 2000 ; kalveram et al . , 1999 ) . in an evaluation of 25 people exposed to five different wind turbine sounds at 40 db , ratings of “ annoyance ” were different among different types of wind turbine noise ( persson waye and öhrström , 2002 ) . none of the psycho-acoustic parameters could explain the difference in annoyance responses . another study of more than 2,000 people suggested that personality traits play a role in the perception of annoyance to environmental issues such as sound ( persson et al . , 2007 ) . annoyance originates from acoustical signals that are not compatible with , or that disturb , psychological functions , in particular , disturbance of current activities . kalveram et al . ( 1999 ) suggest that the main function of noise annoyance is as a warning that fitness may be affected but that it causes little or no physiological effect . protracted annoyance , however , may undermine coping and progress to stress related effects . it appears that this is the main mechanism for effects on the health of a small number of people from prolonged exposure to low levels of noise . the main health effect of noise stress is disturbed sleep , which may lead to other consequences . work with low frequencies has shown that an audible low frequency sound does not normally become objectionable until it is 10 to 15 db above hearing threshold ( inukai et al . , 2000 ; yamada , 1980 ) . an exception is when a listener has developed hostility to the noise source , so that annoyance commences at a lower level . there is no evidence that sound at the levels from wind turbines as heard in residences will cause direct physiological effects . a small number of sensitive people , however , may be stressed by the sound and suffer sleep disturbances .

4.1.3 other aspects of annoyance
some people have concluded that they have health problems caused directly by wind turbines . in order to make sense of these complaints , we must consider not only the sound , but the complex factors culminating in annoyance . there is a large body of medical literature on stress and psychoacoustics . three factors that may be pertinent to a short discussion of wind turbine annoyance effects are the nocebo effect , sensory integration dysfunction and somatoform disorders .

4-3

wind turbine sound and health effects an expert panel review

4.1.4 nocebo effect
the nocebo effect is an adverse outcome , a worsening of mental or physical health , based on fear or belief in adverse effects . this is the opposite of the well known placebo effect , where belief in positive effects of an intervention may produce positive results ( spiegel , 1997 ) . several factors appear to be associated with the nocebo phenomenon : expectations of adverse effects ; conditioning from prior experiences ; certain psychological characteristics such as anxiety , depression and the tendency to somatize ( express psychological factors as physical symptoms ; see below ) , and situational and contextual factors . a large range of reactions include hypervagotonia , manifested by idioventricular heart rhythm ( a slow heart rate of 20 to 50 beats per minute resulting from an intrinsic pacemaker within the ventricles which takes over when normal sinoatrial node regulation is lost ) , drowsiness , nausea , fatigue , insomnia , headache , weakness , dizziness , gastrointestinal ( gi ) complaints and difficulty concentrating ( sadock and sadock , 2005 , p.2425 ) . this array of symptoms is similar to the so-called “ wind turbine syndrome ” coined by pierpont ( 2009 , pre-publication draft ) . yet these are all common symptoms in the general population and no evidence has been presented that such symptoms are more common in persons living near wind turbines . nevertheless , the large volume of media coverage devoted to alleged adverse health effects of wind turbines understandably creates an anticipatory fear in some that they will experience adverse effects from wind turbines . every person is suggestible to some degree . the resulting stress , fear , and hypervigilance may exacerbate or even create problems which would not otherwise exist . in this way , anti-wind farm activists may be creating with their publicity some of the problems that they describe .

4.1.5 somatoform disorders
there are seven somatoform disorders in the fourth edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm-iv-tr ) ( american psychiatric association , 2000 ) . somatoform disorders are physical symptoms which reflect psychological states rather than arising from physical causes . one common somatoform disorder , conversion disorder , is the unconscious expression of stress and anxiety as one or more physical symptoms ( escobar and canino , 1989 ) . common conversion symptoms are sensations of tingling or discomfort , fatigue , poorly localized abdominal pain , headaches , back or neck pain , weakness , loss of balance , hearing and visual abnormalities . the symptoms are not feigned and must be present for at least six months according to dsm-iv-tr and two years according to the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems , 10th revision ( icd-10 ) ( who , 1993 ) . icd-10 specifies the symptoms as belonging to four groups : ( 1 ) gastrointestinal ( abdominal pain , nausea , bloating/gas/ , bad taste in mouth/excessive tongue coating , vomiting/regurgitation , frequent/loose bowel movements ) ; ( 2 ) cardiovascular ( breathlessness without exertion , chest pains ) ; ( 3 ) genitourinary ( frequency or dysuria , unpleasant genital sensations , vaginal discharge ) , and ( 4 ) skin and pain ( blotchiness or discoloration of the skin , pain in the limbs , extremities or joints , paresthesias ) . icd-10 specifies that at least six symptoms must be present in two or more groups . one feature of somatoform disorders is somatosensory amplification , a process in which a person learns to feel body sensations more acutely and may misinterpret the significance of those sensations by equating them with illness ( barsky , 1979 ) . sensory integration dysfunction

describes abnormal sensitivity to any or all sensory stimuli ( sound , touch , light , smell , and taste ) . there is controversy among researchers and clinicians as to whether sensory integration problems exist as an independent entity or as components of a pervasive developmental disorder ( sadock and sadock , 2005 , p. 3135 ) , but their presence can lead to overestimation of the likelihood of being ill ( sadock and sadock , 2005 , p. 1803 ) . sensory integration dysfunction as such is not listed in the dsm-iv-tr or in the icd-10 . day-to-day stressors and adverse life events provide multiple stimuli to which people respond , and that response is often somatic due to catecholamines and activation of the autonomic nervous system . this stress response can become conditioned as memory . there is some evidence that poor coping mechanisms ( anger impulsivity , hostility , isolation , lack of confiding in others ) are linked to physiological reactivity , which is associated with somatic sensation and amplification ( sadock and sadock , 2005 , p. 1806 ) . in summary , the similarities of common human stress responses and conversion symptoms to those described as “ wind turbine syndrome ” are striking . an annoyance factor to wind turbine sounds undoubtedly exists , to which there is a great deal of individual variability . stress has multiple causes and is additive . associated stress from annoyance , exacerbated by the rhetoric , fears , and negative publicity generated by the wind turbine controversy , may contribute to the reported symptoms described by some people living near rural wind turbines .

4.2 infrasound , low-frequency sound and disease
some reports have suggested a link between low frequency sound from wind turbines and certain adverse health effects . a careful review of these reports , however , leads a critical reviewer to question the validity of the claims for a number of reasons , most notably ( 1 ) the level of sound exposure associated with the putative health effects , ( 2 ) the lack of diagnostic specificity associated with the health effects reported , and ( 3 ) the lack of a control group in the analysis .

4.2.1 vibroacoustic disease
vibroacoustic disease ( vad ) in the context of exposure of aircraft engine technicians to sound was defined by portuguese researchers as a whole-body , multi-system entity , caused by chronic exposure to large pressure amplitude and low frequency ( lpalf ) sound ( alvespereira and castelo branco , 2007a ; alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007b ; alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007c ; alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007d ) . vad , the primary feature of which is thickening of cardiovascular structures , such as cardiac muscle and blood vessels , was first noted among airplane technicians , military pilots , and disc jockeys ( maschke , 2004 ; castelo branco , 1999 ) . workers had been exposed to high levels for more than 10 years . there are no epidemiological studies that have evaluated risk of vad from exposure to infrasound . the likelihood of such a risk , however , is remote in light of the much lower vibration levels in the body itself . studies of workers with substantially higher exposure levels have not indicated a risk of vad . vad has been described as leading from initial respiratory infections , through pericardial thickening to severe and life-threatening illness such as stroke , myocardial infarction , and risk of malignancy ( alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007a ) .

4.2.2 high-frequency exposure
all of the exposures of subjects for whom the vad concept was developed , were dominated by higher frequency sounds , a critical point since the frequency range claimed for vadinducing sound is much wider than the frequency range of exposures experienced by the aircraft technicians who were diagnosed with vad ( castelo branco , 1999 ) . originally , proponents of the vad concept had proposed a “ greater than 90 db ” criterion for vad . however , now some claim that vad will result from exposure to almost any level of infrasound and low frequency sound at any frequency below 500 hz . this assertion is an extraordinary extrapolation given that the concept of vad developed from observations that a technician , working around military aircraft on the ground , with engines operating , displayed disorientation ( castelo branco , 1999 ) . sound levels near aircraft were very high . in an evaluation of typical engine spectra of carrier based combat aircraft operating on the ground , the spectra peaked at frequencies above 100 hz with sound levels from 120 to 135 db close to the aircraft ( smith , 2002 ) . the levels drop considerably , however , into the low frequency region . there is an enormous decibel difference between the sound exposure of aircraft technicians and the sound exposure of people who live near wind turbines . animal experiments indicated that exposure levels necessary to cause vad were 13 weeks of continuous exposure to approximately 100 db of low frequency sound ( mendes et al . , 2007 ) . the exposure levels were at least 50 to 60 db higher than wind turbine levels in the same frequency region ( hayes , 2006a ) .

4.2.3 residential exposure : a case series
extrapolation of results from sound levels greater than 90 db and at predominantly higher frequencies ( greater than 100 hz ) to a risk of vad from inaudible wind turbine sound levels of 40 to 50 db in the infrasound region , is a new hypothesis . one investigator , for example , has claimed that wind turbines in residential areas produce acoustical environments that can lead to the development of vad in nearby home-dwellers ( alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007a ) . this claim is based on comparison of only two infrasound exposures . the first is for a family which has experienced a range of health problems and which also complained of disturbances from low frequency sound . the second is for a family which lived near four wind turbines , about which they have become anxious ( alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007a ; alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007b ) . the first family ( family f ) , was exposed to low levels of infrasound consisting of about 50 db at 8 hz and 10 hz from a grain terminal about 3 kilometers ( km ) away and additional sources of low frequency sound , including a nearer railway line and road . the second family ( family r ) lives in a rural area and was described as exposed to infrasound levels of about 55 db to 60 db at 8 hz to 16 hz . these exposures are well below the hearing threshold and not uncommon in urban areas . neither the frequency nor volume of the sound exposures experienced by families f or r are unusual . exposure to infrasound ( < 20 hz ) did not exceed 50 db .

4.2.3.1

family f—exposure to low levels of infrasound

family f has a long history of poor health and a 10-year-old boy was diagnosed with vad due to exposure to infrasound from the grain terminal ( alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007a ; castelo branco et al . , 2004 ) . however , the infrasound levels are well below hearing threshold and are typical of urban infrasound , which occurs widely and to which many people are exposed . according to the authors , the main effect of vad was demonstrated by the 10-year-old boy in the family , as pericardial thickening.3 however , the boy has a history of poor health of unknown etiology ( castelo branco et al . , 2004 ) . castelo branco ( 1999 ) has defined pericardial thickening as an indicator of vad and assumes that the presence of pericardial thickening in the boy from family f must be an effect of vad , caused by exposure to the low-level , low frequency sound from the grain terminal . this assumption excludes other possible causes of pericardial thickening , including viral infection , tuberculosis , irradiation , hemodialysis , neoplasia with pericardial infiltration , bacterial , fungal , or parasitic infections , inflammation after myocardial infarction , asbestosis , and autoimmune diseases . the authors did not exclude these other possible causes of pericardial thickening .

4.2.3.2

family r—proximity to turbines and anxiety

family r , living close to the wind turbines , has low frequency sound exposure similar to that of family f. the family does not have symptoms of vad , but it was claimed that “ family r. will also develop vad should they choose to remain in their home . ” ( alvespereira and castelo branco , 2007b ) . in light of the absence of literature of cohort and case control studies , this bold statement seems to be unsubstantiated by available scientific literature .

4.2.4 critique
it appears that families f and r were self-selected complainants . conclusions derived by alves-pereira and castelo branco ( 2007b ) have been based only on the poor health and the sound exposure of family f , using this single exposure as a measure of potential harmful effects for others . there has been no attempt at an epidemiological study . alves-pereira and castelo branco claim that exposure at home is more significant than exposure at work because of the longer periods of exposure ( alves-pereira and castelo branco , 2007e ) . because an approximate 50 db difference occurs between the exposure from wind turbines and the exposure that induced vad ( hayes , 2006a ) , it will take 105 years ( 100,000 years ) for the wind turbine dose to equal that of one year of the higher level sound . among published scientific literature , this description of the two families is known as a case series , which are of virtually no value in understanding potential causal associations between exposure to a potential hazard ( i.e . , low frequency sound ) and a potential health effect ( i.e . , vibroacoustic disease ) . case reports have value but primarily in generating hypotheses to test in other studies such as large groups of people or in case control studies . the latter type of study can systematically evaluate people with pericardial thickening who live near wind turbines in comparison to people with pericardial thickening who do not live
3 pericardial thickening is unusual thickening of the protective sac ( pericardium ) which surrounds the heart . for example , see http : //www.emedicine.com/radio/topic191.htm .

near wind turbines . case reports need to be confirmed in larger studies , most notably cohort studies and case-control studies , before definitive cause and effect assertions can be drawn . the reports of the two families do not provide persuasive scientific evidence of a link between wind turbine sound and pericardial thickening . wind turbines produce low levels of infrasound and low frequency sound , yet there is no credible scientific evidence that these levels are harmful . if the human body is affected by low , sub-threshold sound levels , a unique and not yet discovered receptor mechanism of extraordinary sensitivity to sound is necessary—a mechanism which can distinguish between the normal , relatively high-level “ sound ” inherent in the human body4 and excitation by external , low-level sound . essential epidemiological studies of the potential effects of exposure at low sound levels at low frequencies have not been conducted . until the fuzziness is clarified , and a receptor mechanism revealed , no reliance can be placed on the case reports that the low levels of infrasound and low frequency sound are a cause of vibroacoustic disease.5 the attribution of dangerous properties to low levels of infrasound continues unproven , as it has been for the past 40 years . no foundation has been demonstrated for the new hypothesis that exposure to sub-threshold , low levels of infrasound will lead to vibroacoustic disease . indeed , human evolution has occurred in the presence of natural infrasound .

4.3 wind turbine syndrome
“ wind turbine syndrome ” as promoted by pierpont ( 2009 , pre-publication draft ) appears to be based on the following two hypotheses : 1. low levels of airborne infrasound from wind turbines , at 1 to 2 hz , directly affect the vestibular system . 2. low levels of airborne infrasound from wind turbines at 4 to 8 hz enter the lungs via the mouth and then vibrate the diaphragm , which transmits vibration to the viscera , or internal organs of the body . the combined effect of these infrasound frequencies sends confusing information to the position and motion detectors of the body , which in turn leads to a range of disturbing symptoms .

4.3.1 evaluation of infrasound on the vestibular system
consider the first hypothesis . the support for this hypothesis is a report apparently misunderstood to mean that the vestibular system is more sensitive than the cochlea to low levels of both sound and vibration ( todd et al . , 2008a ) . the todd report is concerned with vibration input to the mastoid area of the skull , and the corresponding detection of these vibrations by the cochlea and vestibular system . the lowest frequency used was 100 hz ,
4 body sounds are often used for diagnosis . for example see gross , v. , a. dittmar , t. penzel , f. , schüttler , and p. von wichert.. ( 2000 ) : `` the relationship between normal lung sounds , age , and gender . `` american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine . volume 162 , number 3 : 905 - 909 . 5 this statement should not be interpreted as a criticism of the work of the vad group with aircraft technicians at high noise levels .

considerably higher than the upper limit of the infrasound frequency ( 20 hz ) . the report does not address air-conducted sound or infrasound , which according to pierpont excites the vestibular system by airborne sound and by skull vibration . this source does not support pierpont ’ s hypothesis and does not demonstrate the points that she is trying to make . there is no credible scientific evidence that low levels of wind turbine sound at 1 to 2 hz will directly affect the vestibular system . in fact , it is likely that the sound will be lost in the natural infrasonic background sound of the body . the second hypothesis is equally unsupported with appropriate scientific investigations . the body is a noisy system at low frequencies . in addition to the beating heart at a frequency of 1 to 2 hz , the body emits sounds from blood circulation , bowels , stomach , muscle contraction , and other internal sources . body sounds can be detected externally to the body by the stethoscope .

4.3.2 evaluation of infrasound on internal organs
it is well known that one source of sound may mask the effect of another similar source . if an external sound is detected within the body in the presence of internally generated sounds , the external sound must produce a greater effect in the body than the internal sounds . the skin is very reflective at higher frequencies , although the reflectivity reduces at lower frequencies ( katz , 2000 ) . investigations at very low frequencies show a reduction of about 30 db from external to internal sound in the body of a sheep ( peters et al . , 1993 ) . these results suggest an attenuation ( reduction ) of low frequency sound by the body before the low frequency sound reaches the internal organs . low-level sounds from outside the body do not cause a high enough excitation within the body to exceed the internal body sounds . pierpont refers to papers from takahashi and colleagues on vibration excitation of the head by high levels of external sound ( over 100 db ) . however , these papers state that response of the head at frequencies below 20 hz was not measurable due to the masking effect of internal body vibration ( takahashi et al . , 2005 ; takahashi et al . , 1999 ) . when measuring chest resonant vibration caused by external sounds , the internal vibration masks resonance for external sounds below 80 db excitation level ( leventhall , 2006 ) . thus , the second hypothesis also fails . to recruit subjects for her study , pierpont sent out a general call for anybody believing their health had been adversely affected by wind turbines . she asked respondents to contact her for a telephone interview . the case series results for ten families ( 37 subjects ) are presented in pierpont ( 2009 , pre-publication draft ) . symptoms included sleep disturbance , headache , tinnitus , ear pressure , vertigo , nausea , visual blurring , tachycardia , irritability , concentration , memory , panic attacks , internal pulsation , and quivering . this type of study is known as a case series . a case series is of limited , if any , value in evaluating causal connections between an environmental exposure ( in this case , sound ) and a designated health effect ( so called “ wind turbine syndrome ” ) . this particular case series is substantially limited by selection bias , in which people who already think that they have been affected by wind turbines “ self select “ to participate in the case series . this approach introduces a significant bias in the results , especially in the absence of a control group who do not live in proximity of a wind turbine . the results of this case series are at best hypothesis-generating activities that do not provide support for a causal link between wind turbine sound and socalled “ wind turbine syndrome . ”

4-9

wind turbine sound and health effects an expert panel review

however , these so called “ wind turbine syndrome “ symptoms are not new and have been published previously in the context of “ annoyance ” to environmental sounds ( nagai et al . , 1989 ; møller and lydolf , 2002 ; mirowska and mroz , 2000 ) . the following symptoms are based on the experience of noise sufferers extending over a number of years : distraction , dizziness , eye strain , fatigue , feeling vibration , headache , insomnia , muscle spasm , nausea , nose bleeds , palpitations , pressure in the ears or head , skin burns , stress , and tension ( leventhall , 2002 ) . the symptoms are common in cases of extreme and persistent annoyance , leading to stress responses in the affected individual and may also result from severe tinnitus , when there is no external sound . the symptoms are exhibited by a small proportion of sensitive persons and may be alleviated by a course of psychotherapy , aimed at desensitization from the sound ( leventhall et al . , 2008 ) . the similarity between the symptoms of noise annoyance and those of “ wind turbine syndrome ” indicates that this “ diagnosis “ is not a pathophysiological effect , but is an example of the well-known stress effects of exposure to noise , as displayed by a small proportion of the population . these effects are familiar to environmental noise control officers and other “ on the ground ” professionals . “ wind turbine syndrome , ” not a recognized medical diagnosis , is essentially reflective of symptoms associated with noise annoyance and is an unnecessary and confusing addition to the vocabulary on noise . this syndrome is not a recognized diagnosis in the medical community . there are no unique symptoms or combinations of symptoms that would lead to a specific pattern of this hypothesized disorder . the collective symptoms in some people exposed to wind turbines are more likely associated with annoyance to low sound levels .

4.4 visceral vibratory vestibular disturbance
4.4.1 hypothesis
in addition to case reports of symptoms reported by people who live near wind turbines , pierpont has proposed a hypothesis that purports to explain how some of these symptoms arise : visceral vibratory vestibular disturbance ( vvvd ) ( pierpont , 2009 , pre-publication draft ) . vvvd has been described as consisting of vibration associated with low frequencies that enters the body and causes a myriad of symptoms . pierpont considers vvvd to be the most distinctive feature of a nonspecific set of symptoms that she describes as “ wind turbine syndrome . ” as the name vvvd implies , wind turbine sound in the 4 to 8 hz spectral region is hypothesized to cause vibrations in abdominal viscera ( e.g . , intestines , liver , and kidneys ) that in turn send neural signals to the part of the brain that normally receives information from the vestibular labyrinth . these signals hypothetically conflict with signals from the vestibular labyrinth and other sensory inputs ( visual , proprioceptive ) , leading to unpleasant symptoms , including panic . unpleasant symptoms ( especially nausea ) can certainly be caused by sensory conflict ; this is how scientists explain motion sickness . however , this hypothesis of vvvd is implausible based on knowledge of sensory systems and the energy needed to stimulate them . whether implausible or not , there are time-tested scientific methods available to evaluate the legitimacy of any hypothesis and at this stage , vvvd as proposed by pierpont is an untested hypothesis . a case series of 10 families recruited to participate in a study based on certain symptoms would not be considered evidence of causality by research or policy institutions such as the international agency for research on

cancer ( iarc ) or epa . as noted earlier in this report , a case series of self-selected patients does not constitute evidence of a causal connection .

4.4.2 critique
receptors capable of sensing vibration are located predominantly in the skin and joints . a clinical neurological examination normally includes assessment of vibration sensitivity . it is highly unlikely , however , that airborne sound at comfortable levels could stimulate these receptors , because most of airborne sound energy is reflected away from the body . takahashi et al . ( 2005 ) used airborne sound to produce chest or abdominal vibration that exceeded ambient body levels . this vibration may or may not have been detectable by the subjects . takahashi found that levels of 100 db sound pressure level were required at 20 to 50 hz ( even higher levels would have been required at lower and higher frequencies ) . sounds like this would be considered by most people to be very loud , and are well beyond the levels produced by wind turbines at residential distances . comparison of the responses to low frequency airborne sound by normal hearing and profoundly deaf persons has shown that deaf subjects can detect sound transmitted through their body only when it is well above the normal hearing threshold ( yamada et al . , 1983 ) . for example , at 16 hz , the deaf persons ’ average threshold was 128 db sound pressure level , 40 db higher than that of the hearing subjects . it has also been shown that , at higher frequencies , the body surface is very reflective of sound ( katz , 2000 ) . similarly , work on transmission of low frequency sound into the bodies of sheep has shown a loss of about 30 db ( peters et al . , 1993 ) the visceral receptors invoked as a mechanism for vvvd have been shown to respond to static gravitational position changes , but not to vibration ( that is why they are called graviceptors ) . if there were vibration-sensitive receptors in the abdominal viscera , they would be constantly barraged by low frequency body sounds such as pulsatile blood flow and bowel sounds , while external sounds would be attenuated by both the impedance mismatch and dissipation of energy in the overlying tissues . finally , wind turbine sound at realistic distances possesses little , if any , acoustic energy , at 4 to 8 hz . it has been hypothesized that the vestibular labyrinth may be “ abnormally stimulated ” by wind turbine sound ( pierpont , 2009 , pre-publication draft ) . as noted in earlier sections of this report , moderately loud airborne sound , at frequencies up to about 500 hz , can indeed stimulate not only the cochlea ( the hearing organ ) but also the otolith organs . this is not abnormal , and there is no evidence in the medical literature that it is in any way unpleasant or harmful . in ordinary life , most of us are exposed for hours every day to sounds louder than those experienced at realistic distances from wind turbines , with no adverse effects . this assertion that the vestibular labyrinth is stimulated at levels below hearing threshold is based on a misunderstanding of research that used bone-conducted vibration rather than airborne sound . indeed , those who wear bone conduction hearing aids experience constant stimulation of their vestibular systems , in addition to the cochlea , without adverse effects .

4.5 interpreting studies and reports
in light of the unproven hypotheses that have been introduced as reflective of adverse health effects attributed to wind turbines , it can be instructive to review the type of research studies that can be used to determine definitive links between exposure to an environmental

4-11

wind turbine sound and health effects an expert panel review

hazard ( in this case , sound and vibration emissions from wind turbines ) and adverse health effects ( the so-called “ wind turbine syndrome ” ) . how do we know , for example , that cigarettes cause lung cancer and that excessive noise causes hearing loss ? almost always , the first indication that an exposure might be harmful comes from the informal observations of doctors who notice a possible correlation between an exposure and a disease , then communicate their findings to colleagues in case reports , or reports of groups of cases ( case series ) . these initial observations are usually uncontrolled ; that is , there is no comparison of the people who have both exposure and disease to control groups of people who are either non-exposed or disease-free . there is usually no way to be sure that the apparent association is statistically significant ( as opposed to simple coincidence ) , or that there is a causal relationship between the exposure and the disease in question , without control subjects . for these reasons , case reports and case series can not prove that an exposure is really harmful , but can only help to develop hypotheses that can then be tested in controlled studies ( levine et al . , 1994 ; genovese , 2004 ; mclaughlin , 2003 ) . once suspicion of harm has been raised , controlled studies ( case-control or cohort ) are essential to determine whether or not a causal association is likely , and only after multiple independent-controlled studies show consistent results is the association likely to be broadly accepted ( iarc , 2006 ) . case-control studies compare people with the disease to people without the disease ( ensuring as far as possible that the two groups are well-matched with respect to all other variables that might affect the chance of having the disease , such as age , sex , and other exposures known to cause the disease ) . if the disease group is found to be much more likely to have had the exposure in question , and if multiple types of error and bias can be excluded ( genovese , 2004 ) , a causal link is likely . multiple case-control studies were necessary before the link between smoking and lung cancer could be proved . cohort studies compare people with the exposure to well-matched control subjects who have not had that exposure . if the exposed group proves to be much more likely to have the disease , assuming error and bias can be excluded , a causal link is likely . after multiple cohort studies , it was clear that excessive noise exposure caused hearing loss ( mccunney and meyer , 2007 ) . in the case of wind turbine noise and its hypothetical relationships to “ wind turbine syndrome ” and vibroacoustic disease , the weakest type of evidence—case series—is available , from only a single investigator . these reports can do no more than suggest hypotheses for further research . nevertheless , if additional and independent investigators begin to report adverse health effects in people exposed to wind turbine noise , in excess of those found in unexposed groups , and if some consistent syndrome or set of symptoms emerges , this advice could change . thus , at this time , “ wind turbine syndrome ” and vvvd are unproven hypotheses ( essentially unproven ideas ) that have not been confirmed by appropriate research studies , most notably cohort and case control studies . however , the weakness of the basic hypotheses makes such studies unlikely to proceed .

4.6 standards for siting wind turbines
4.6.1 introduction
while the use of large industrial-scale wind turbines is well established in europe , the development of comparable wind energy facilities in north america is a more recent occurrence . the growth of wind and other renewable energy sources is expected to continue . opponents of wind energy development argue that the height and setback regulations established in some jurisdictions are too lenient and that the noise limits which are applied to other sources of noise ( either industrial or transportation ) are not sufficient for wind turbines for a variety of reasons . therefore , they are concerned that the health and well-being of some residents who live in the vicinity ( or close proximity to ) of these facilities is threatened . critics maintain that wind turbine noise may present more than an annoyance to nearby residents especially at night when ambient levels may be low . consequently , there are those who advocate for a revision of the existing regulations for noise and setback pertaining to the siting of wind installations ( kamperman and james , 2009 ) . some have indicated their belief that setbacks of more than 1 mile may be necessary . while the primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential for adverse health effects rather than develop public policy , the panel does not find that setbacks of 1 mile are warranted .

4.6.2 noise regulations and ordinances
in 1974 , epa published a report that examined the levels of environmental noise necessary to protect public health and welfare ( epa , 1974 ) . based on the analysis of available scientific data , epa specified a range of day-night sound levels necessary to protect the public health and welfare from the effects of environmental noise , with a reasonable margin of safety . rather than establishing standards or regulations , however , epa simply identified noise levels below which the general public would not be placed at risk from any of the identified effects of noise . each federal agency has developed its own noise criteria for sources for which they have jurisdiction ( i.e . , the federal aviation administration regulates aircraft and airport noise , the federal highway administration regulates highway noise , and the federal energy regulatory commission regulates interstate pipelines ( bastasch , 2005 ) . state and local governments were provided guidance by epa on how to develop their own noise regulations , but the establishment of appropriate limits was left to local authorities to determine given each community ’ s differing values and land use priorities ( epa , 1975 ) .

4.6.3 wind turbine siting guidelines
establishing appropriate noise limits and setback distances for wind turbines has been a concern of many who are interested in wind energy . there are several approaches to regulating noise , from any source , including wind turbines . they can generally be classified as absolute or relative standards or a combination of absolute and relative standards . absolute standards establish a fixed limit irrespective of existing noise levels . for wind turbines , a single absolute limit may be established regardless of wind speed ( i.e . , 50 dba ) or different limits may be established for various wind speeds ( i.e . , 40 dba at 5 meters per second [ m/s ] and 45 dba at 8 m/s ) . the ontario ministry of environment ( 2008 ) wind turbine noise guidelines is an example of fixed limits for each integer wind speed between 4 and 10 meters per second . relative standards limit the increase over existing levels and may

4-13

wind turbine sound and health effects an expert panel review

also establish either an absolute floor or ceiling beyond which the relative increase is not considered . that is , for example , if a relative increase of 10 dba with a ceiling of 50 dba is allowed and the existing level is 45 dba , a level of 55 dba would not be allowed . similarly , if a floor of 40 dba was established and the existing level is 25 dba , 40 dba rather than 35 dba would be allowed . fixed distance setbacks have also been discussed . critics of this approach suggest that fixed setbacks do not take into account the number or size of the turbines nor do they consider other potential sources of noise within the project area . it is clear that like many other sources of noise , a uniform regulator approach for wind turbine noise has not been established either domestically or internationally . a draft report titled environmental noise and health in the uk , published for comment in 2009 by the health protection agency ( hpa ) on behalf of an ad hoc expert group , provides insightful comments on the world health organization ’ s noise guidelines ( who , 1999 ) . the hpa draft report can be viewed at the following address : http : //www.hpa.org.uk/web/hpawebfile/hpaweb_c/1246433634856 the hpa report states the following : it is important to bear in mind that the who guideline values , like other who guidelines , are offered to policymakers as a contribution to policy development . they are not intended as standards in a formal sense but as a possible basis for the development of standards . by way of overall summary , the 1998 npl report noted [ a british report titled health-based noise assessment methods— a review and feasibility study ( porter et al . , 1998 ) as quoted in hpa 2009 ] : the who guidelines represent a consensus view of international expert opinion on the lowest noise levels below which the occurrence rates of particular effects can be assumed to be negligible . exceedances of the who guideline values do not necessarily imply significant noise impact and indeed , it may be that significant impacts do not occur until much higher degrees of noise exposure are reached . the guidelines form a starting point for policy development . however , it will clearly be important to consider the costs and benefits of reducing noise levels and , as in other areas , this should inform the setting of objectives . ( from : hpa , 2009 , p. 77 ) the hpa report further states the following : surveys have shown that about half of the uk population lives in areas where daytime sound levels exceed those recommended in the who community noise guidelines . about two-thirds of the population live in areas where the night-time guidelines recommended by who are exceeded . ( p. 81 ) that sleep can be affected by noise is common knowledge . defining a dose-response curve that describes the relationship between exposure to noise and sleep disturbance has , however , proved surprisingly difficult . laboratory studies and field studies have generated different results . in part this is due to habituation to noise which , in the field , is common in many people . ( p. 82 ) our examination of the evidence relating to the effects of environmental noise on health has demonstrated that this is a rapidly developing area . any single report will , therefore , need to be revised within a few years . we conclude and recommend that an

4-14

wind turbine sound and health effects an expert panel review

independent expert committee to address these issues on a long-term basis be established . ( p. 82 ) the statements cited above from the hpa and who documents address general environmental noise concerns rather than concerns focused solely on wind turbine noise .

conclusions
many countries have turned to wind energy as a key strategy to generate power in an environmentally clean manner . wind energy enjoys considerable public support , but it has its detractors , who have publicized their concerns that the sounds emitted from wind turbines cause adverse health consequences . the objective of the panel was to develop an authoritative reference document for the use of legislators , regulators , and citizens simply wanting to make sense of the conflicting information about wind turbine sound . to this end , the panel undertook extensive review , analysis , and discussion of the peer-reviewed literature on wind turbine sound and possible health effects . the varied professional backgrounds of panel members ( audiology , acoustics , otolaryngology , occupational and environmental medicine , and public health ) were highly advantageous in creating a diversity of informed perspectives . participants were able to examine issues surrounding health effects and discuss plausible biological effects with considerable combined expertise . following review , analysis , and discussion , the panel reached agreement on three key points : • • • there is nothing unique about the sounds and vibrations emitted by wind turbines . the body of accumulated knowledge about sound and health is substantial . the body of accumulated knowledge provides no evidence that the audible or subaudible sounds emitted by wind turbines have any direct adverse physiological effects .

the panel appreciated the complexities involved in the varied human reactions to sound , particularly sounds that modulate in intensity or frequency . most complaints about wind turbine sound relate to the aerodynamic sound component ( the swish sound ) produced by the turbine blades . the sound levels are similar to the ambient noise levels in urban environments . a small minority of those exposed report annoyance and stress associated with noise perception . this report summarizes a number of physical and psychological variables that may influence adverse reactions . in particular , the panel considered “ wind turbine syndrome ” and vibroacoustic disease , which have been claimed as causes of adverse health effects . the evidence indicates that “ wind turbine syndrome ” is based on misinterpretation of physiologic data and that the features of the so-called syndrome are merely a subset of annoyance reactions . the evidence for vibroacoustic disease ( tissue inflammation and fibrosis associated with sound exposure ) is extremely dubious at levels of sound associated with wind turbines . the panel also considered the quality of epidemiologic evidence required to prove harm . in epidemiology , initial case reports and uncontrolled observations of disease associations

need to be confirmed through controlled studies with case-control or cohort methodology before they can be accepted as reflective of casual connections between wind turbine sound and health effects . in the area of wind turbine health effects , no case-control or cohort studies have been conducted as of this date . accordingly , allegations of adverse health effects from wind turbines are as yet unproven . panel members agree that the number and uncontrolled nature of existing case reports of adverse health effects alleged to be associated with wind turbines are insufficient to advocate for funding further studies . in conclusion : 1. sound from wind turbines does not pose a risk of hearing loss or any other adverse health effect in humans . 2. subaudible , low frequency sound and infrasound from wind turbines do not present a risk to human health . 3. some people may be annoyed at the presence of sound from wind turbines . annoyance is not a pathological entity . 4. a major cause of concern about wind turbine sound is its fluctuating nature . some may find this sound annoying , a reaction that depends primarily on personal characteristics as opposed to the intensity of the sound level .

fundamentals of sound
the following appendix provides additional background information on sound and how it is defined . one atmospheric pressure is given by 100,000 pascals ( pa ) , where one pascal is one newton per square meter ( n/m2 ) , and a sound pressure of 94 db re 20μpa is given by 1 pa ( see later for decibels ) . the frequency of the fluctuations may be between 20 times a second ( 20 hz ) , and up to 20,000 times a second ( 20,000 hz ) for the “ audible ” noise . frequencies below 20 hz are commonly called “ infrasound , ” although there is a very fuzzy boundary between infrasound and low frequency noise . infrasound at high levels is audible . low frequency noise might be from about 10 hz to about 200 hz . in addition to frequency , the quantities which define a sound wave include : • • • pressure , p wavelength , λ velocity , c = 340m/s approx , depending on temperature

the velocity and wavelength are related by : velocity = wavelength x frequency , relating frequency and wavelength by velocity gives freq hz 16 31.5 11 63 5.4 125 2.7 250 1.4 500 0.68 1000 0.34 2000 0.17 4000 0.085

wavelength 21 m

low frequencies have long wavelengths . it is useful to develop an appreciation of frequencies and related wavelengths , since this helps an understanding of noise propagation and control . sound pressure in a wave is force per unit of area of the wave and has units of n/m2 , which is abbreviated to pa. the sound pressure fluctuates above and below atmospheric pressure by a very small amount . the sound power is a characteristic of the source , and is its rate of production of energy , expressed in watts . the sound power is the fundamental property of the source , whilst the sound pressure at a measurement location depends on the transmission path from source to receiver . most sound sources , including wind turbines , are specified in terms of their sound power . the sound power of a wind turbine is typically in the 100-105 dba range , which is similar to that of a leaf blower . the sound power is used to predict propagation of the sound , where the source is assumed to be at the hub .

sound levels
the decibel is the logarithm of the ratio between two values of a quantity such as power , pressure or intensity , with a multiplying constant to give convenient numerical factors . logarithms are useful for compressing a wide range of quantities into a smaller range . for example : log1010 = 1 log10100 = 2 log101000 = 3 the ratio of 1000:10 is compressed into a ratio of 3:1. this approach is advantageous for handling sound levels , where the ratio of the highest to the lowest sound which we are likely to encounter is as high as 1,000,000 to 1. a useful development , many years ago , was to take the ratios with respect to the quietest sound which we can hear . this is the threshold of hearing at 1,000 hz , which is 20 micropascals ( μpa ) ( 2x10-5pa ) of pressure for the average young healthy person . sound powers in decibels are taken with respect to a reference level of 10-12 watts . when the word “ level ” is added to the word for a physical quantity , decibel levels are implied , denoted by lx , where x is the symbol for the quantity . pressure level

⎡p⎤ l p = 20 log10 ⎢ ⎥ db ⎣ p0 ⎦

where p is the measured pressure and p0 is the reference pressure level of 2x10-5 pa a little calculation allows us to express the sound pressure level at a distance from a source of known sound power level as sound pressure level , lp = lw –20log [ r ] –11 db where lp is the sound pressure level lw is the sound power level of the source r is the distance from the source

this is the basic equation for spherical sound propagation . it is used in prediction of wind turbine sound but , in a real calculation , has many additions to it , to take into account the atmospheric , ground and topographic conditions . however , as a simple calculation , the sound level at a distance of 500m from a source of sound power 100 dba is 35 dba . equivalent level ( leq ) : this is a steady level over a period of time , which has the same energy as that of the fluctuating level actually occurring during that time . a-weighted equivalent level , designated laeq , is used for many legislative purposes , including for assessment of wind turbine sound . percentiles ( ln ) l these are a statistical measure of the fluctuations in overall noise level , that is , in the envelope of the noise , which is usually sampled a number of times per second , typically ten times . the most used percentiles are l90 and l10 . the l90 is the level exceeded for 90 percent of the time and represents a low level in the noise . it is often used to assess

background noise . the l10 is the level exceeded for 10 percent of the time and is a measure of the higher levels in a noise . modern computing sound level meters give a range of percentiles . note that the percentile is a statistical measure over a specified time interval .

frequency analysis
this gives more detail of the frequency components of a noise . frequency analysis normally uses one of three approaches : octave band , one-third octave band or narrow band . narrow band analysis is most useful for complex tonal noises . it could be used , for example , to determine a fan tone frequency , to find the frequencies of vibration transmission from machinery or to detect system resonances . all analyses require an averaging over time , so that the detail of fluctuations in the noise is normally lost . criteria for assessment of noise are based on dba , octave bands , or 1/3-octave band measurements . these measures clearly give increasingly detailed information about the noise .

the human ear
humans have ears with three general regions : 1. an outer ear , including an ear ( auditory ) canal 2. an air-containing middle ear that includes an eardrum and small bones called ossicles ( three in mammals , one in other animals ) 3. an inner ear that includes organs of hearing ( in mammals , this is the organ of corti in the cochlea ) and balance ( vestibular labyrinth ) airborne sound passes thorough the ear canal , making the eardrum and ossicles vibrate , and this vibration then sets the fluids of the cochlea into motion . specialized “ hair cells ” convert this fluid movement into nerve impulses that travel to the brain along the auditory nerve . the hair cells , nerve cells , and other cells in the cochlea can be damaged by excessive noise , trauma , toxins , ear diseases , and as part of the aging process . damage to the cochlea causes “ sensorineural hearing loss , ” the most common type of hearing loss in the united states . it is essential to understand the role of the middle ear , as well as the difference between air conduction and bone conduction . the middle ear performs the essential task of converting airborne sound into inner ear fluid movement , a process known as impedance matching ( air is a low-impedance medium , meaning that its molecules move easily in response to sound pressure , while water is a high-impedance medium ) . without impedance matching , over 99.9 percent of airborne sound energy is reflected away from the body . the middle ear enables animals living in air to hear very soft sounds that would otherwise be inaudible , but it is unnecessary for animals that live in water , because sound traveling in water passes easily into the body ( which is mostly water ) . when a child has an ear infection , or an adult places earplugs in his ears , a “ conductive hearing loss ” dramatically reduces the transmission of airborne sound into the inner ear . people with conductive hearing loss can still hear sounds presented directly to the skull by “ bone conduction . ” this is how both humans and fishes hear underwater or when a vibrating tuning fork is applied to the head , but it requires much more acoustic energy than air conduction hearing .

measuring sound
a sound level meter is the standard way of measuring sound . environmental sound is normally assessed by the a-weighting . although hand-held instruments appear to be easy to use , lack of understanding of their operation and limitations , and the meaning of the varied measurements which they can give , may result in misleading readings . the weighting network and electrical filters are an important part of the sound level meter , as they give an indication of the frequency components of the sound . the filters are as follows : • • • • • • a-weighting : c-weighting : linear ( z-weighting ) : octave filters : third octave filters : narrow band : on all meters on most meters on many meters on some meters on some meters on a few meters

sound level meter weighting networks are shown in figure c-1 . originally , the a-weighting was intended for low levels of noise . c-weighting was intended for higher levels of noise . the weighting networks were based on human hearing contours at low and high levels and it was hoped that their use would mimic the response of the ear . this concept , which did not work out in practice , has now been abandoned and a- and c-weighting are used at all levels . linear weighting is used to detect low frequencies . a specialist g-weighting is used for infrasound below 20 hz . figure c-1 shows that the a-weighting depresses the levels of the low frequencies , as the ear is less sensitive to these . there is general consensus that a-weighting is appropriate for estimation of the hazard of nihl . with respect to other effects , such as annoyance , aweighting is acceptable if there is largely middle and high frequency noise present , but if the noise is unusually high at low frequencies , or contains prominent low frequency tones , the a-weighting may not give a valid measure . compared with other noise sources , wind turbine spectra , as heard indoors at typical separation distances , have less low frequency content than most other sources ( pedersen , 2008 ) .

propagation of sound

appendix d

propagation of sound
the propagation of noise from wind turbines is determined by a number of factors , including : • • • • • geometrical spreading , given by k = 20log [ r ] –11 db , at a distance r molecular absorption . this is conversion of acoustic energy to heat and is frequency dependent turbulent scattering from local variations in wind velocity and air temperature and is moderately frequency dependent ground effects—reflection , topography and absorption are frequency dependent ; their effects increasing as the frequency increases near surface effects—temperature and wind gradients .

the sound pressure at a point , distant from source , is given by lp = lw - k—d - aa - ag in which : lp is the sound pressure at the receiving point lw is the sound power of the turbine in decibels re 10-12 watts k is the geometrical spreading term , which is inherent in all sources d is a directivity index , which takes non-uniform spreading into account aa is an atmospheric absorption and other near surface effects term ag is a ground absorption and other surface effects term near surface meteorological effects are complex , as wind and temperature gradients affect propagation through the air .

-11. introduction

this report presents results from the study commissioned by natural power consultants ltd on behalf of a consortium of wind energy companies on 16 march 2001 , on the generic issues relating to the impact of wind turbines on radar and air traffic management , and mitigation measures to address those impacts . the focus of this report is collation of information on the practical experience of air traffic service providers of the effects of wind turbines on radar , and the operational consequences thereof . until now , stated safeguarding policy , particularly in the ministry of defence , has been driven mainly by engineering analysis which has focused on the theoretical probability of wind turbines appearing on radar . however little work has been carried out on the significance , from the perspective of air traffic management , of any visible effects on radar . this report identifies locations both in the uk and abroad where wind turbines are line of sight to radars , and presents evidence on the nature of any effects of radar and their significance for the effectiveness and safety of air traffic control . the project workscope is reproduced at appendix a. a list of consultees is reproduced at appendix b .

-22. types and functions of air traffic radar

air traffic control radar is of two types . primary surveillance radar equipment sends out pulses of electromagnetic energy which will reflect off objects in their path . the radar 's receiver antenna detects the returning 'echoes ' and these are displayed on the radar screen . the time taken for the pulse to travel out to the target and back gives an indication of the range of the object from the radar , while the antenna 's orientation in azimuth ( in the horizontal plane ) indicates the direction of the object from the radar . primary radar has no intrinsic means of differentiating one type of object from another ; its energy will bounce off any object in its path . primary surveillance radar for air traffic control has no means of determining the height of any object . as the radar antenna sweeps round continuously through 360° , it is scanning a large sector of airspace in the vertical plane , typically from 0° elevation up to 40° . any objects which are over the same location laterally but are separated vertically will appear in the same place on the radar screen , which is a 2-d display.1 to determine the height of any aircraft appearing on their radar , controllers must either ask the pilot to report the height of the aircraft , and/or use information derived from secondary surveillance radar . secondary surveillance radar ( ssr ) is the second type of radar equipment used for air traffic control . like primary radar , ssr relies on an antenna rotating continuously through 360° . however the radar does not transmit raw pulses of energy ; it transmits an interrogation signal . this triggers a response signal from equipment known as a transponder in the aircraft . the response signal contains a four-digit code which is set by the pilot , and in most cases also contains the height of the aircraft . the returned transponder signal is received at the ssr antenna , decoded , and the four-figure code and height are presented on the radar screen next to the aircraft 's location . this enables controllers to positively identify radar returns on their screens and ( after verbal confirmation from the pilot ) to confirm their height . in the uk , all aircraft flying at or above 10,000 feet , and all aircraft flying on instruments in controlled airspace , must carry a transponder . all airliners and military aircraft carry ssr transponders . some light aircraft do not . aircraft fitted with transponders may not have them switched on , in which case they will not be visible to ssr . most air traffic control radar units are equipped with both primary and secondary radar . the ssr antenna is often located on top of the primary radar antenna , the two rotating together . some air traffic control units have ssr data fed to them from a remote site by landline or radio link . in some cases - for example over south west england and north west scotland - radar services to en route traffic are provided using ssr only , without primary radar .

modern air defence radars are able to differentiate between targets vertically by using antennae which are segmented , with each antenna segment scanning a separate elevation angle .

-3radar has a number of inherent technical limits to its performance . these are outlined in a caa circular : `` the performance of even the most modern radars is rarely perfect . for example , returns from small , slow-moving aircraft such as hang gliders , microlights etc may be suppressed by electronic circuits which cancel unwanted radar returns from road traffic , weather and terrain . even when displayed , radar returns from small or slow-moving aircraft are occasionally indistinguishable from certain non-aircraft returns . in the worst case , it may be impossible for the controller to determine conclusively that a transitory radar return is that of an aircraft . hence , controllers may not always be aware of all potential conflictions , and may be unable to pass avoiding action and/or traffic information when an aircraft to which they are providing a radar service is in the vicinity of a small or slow-moving aircraft . `` 2 functions radar performs two principal functions in air traffic control . aerodrome surveillance radar is used to provide approach control services to aircraft in the vicinity of an airport . this may include vectoring aircraft to the final approach for landing , providing radar services to departing aircraft , and providing a service to aircraft in transit through the area . in the uk , aerodrome surveillance radar is approved to a maximum range of 42.5nm from the airfield . aerodrome surveillance radars typically operate in the 10cm waveband . en route radars , which in the uk are all operated by national air traffic services ( nats ) , are used to control or provide radar services to traffic in transit . this includes commercial airliners and other traffic flying in controlled airspace , and military traffic . most en route radars operate in the 23cm waveband - a lower frequency than aerodrome surveillance radars - since this gives the radar longer range . some nats radars - such as those at glasgow , aberdeen , belfast and sumburgh - perform a dual function of aerodrome surveillance and en route .

-43. air traffic radar services

an outline of the policies , standards and procedures for provision of air traffic radar services in the uk is necessary in order to understand the basis for expressed concerns about the impact of wind turbines on radar , and the feasibility of any mitigation measures . air traffic control services in the uk article 88 of the air navigation order ( ano ) 2000 requires that civil air traffic control ( atc ) services in the uk are provided only under the terms of an approval granted by the civil aviation authority ( caa ) . article 89 of the ano stipulates that such air traffic services may only be provided in accordance with standards and procedures specified in a caa-approved manual of air traffic services . the uk regulatory regime for civilian air traffic control is goalsetting in nature - air traffic service ( ats ) providers are responsible for making their own decisions on the services they provide and how they will meet legal obligations and safety standards . the caa then assesses whether the ats provider 's proposals meet safety objectives . if the objectives are met the caa grants approval . continuing approval is achieved through auditing and inspection , provided in the case of aerodrome radars through three caa safety regulation group ( srg ) regional offices across the uk . generic national atc standards and procedures are set out in the manual of air traffic services part 1 ( mats part 1 ) . this document provides both mandatory instructions and discretionary guidance to controllers and additionally states `` ( n ) othing in this manual prevents controllers from using their own discretion and initiative in any particular circumstance . `` 3 the standards and procedures applying to particular air traffic control units are set out in a separate mats part 2 for each unit . these also require caa approval . for military air traffic control services in the uk , the standards and procedures are set out in a document known as jsp 318a . mats part 1 , section 1 , chapter 3 , specifies the minimum standards for separation distances between aircraft to be applied by air traffic controllers . these can be defined as horizontal distances , vertical distances , or time periods . controllers providing a radar service will apply minimum separation standards either by ensuring that aircraft returns on the radar display are the specified minimum horizontal distance apart , or by ensuring that aircraft are separated vertically by the required minimum distance .

-5for the purposes of this report , the required minimum separation standards can be summarised as those applying in controlled airspace ( cas ) and those applying in uncontrolled airspace . controlled airspace exists around major airports and in 'airways ' along the main air traffic routes . in almost all cas in the uk , aircraft are not permitted to enter that airspace unless they have received an air traffic control clearance . in general , controllers are permitted to assume that any radar return appearing within the lateral confines of their airspace , which does not correspond to the position of an aircraft which has received a clearance , is not an aircraft.4 they will then not be required to provide separation between the unknown return and any aircraft to which they are providing a service . in most controlled airspace in the vicinity of airports in the uk , the minimum separation between aircraft is 3nm horizontally or 1000ft vertically . these minima are lower than in uncontrolled airspace because controlled airspace is a 'known traffic environment ' , where the intentions of all traffic are known and therefore the movements of aircraft are predictable . radar equipment must also meet specified performance standards in order to support 3nm separation . in uncontrolled airspace , because unknown aircraft may be present , including some which are invisible on radar due to their size , shape and/or construction materials , minimum separation distances are normally larger . where aircraft are being provided with a radar advisory service in uncontrolled airspace ( see below ) , controllers will seek to maintain separation of 5nm horizontally or 3000ft vertically against non-participating traffic ( aircraft which are not being provided with an air traffic service by the same unit ) . these separation standards are minima and can be increased at the request of a pilot , when a controller considers it necessary , or at the direction of the caa . the standards can also be reduced in some circumstances . this requires caa approval and the reduced minima must be published in the mats part 2 for the unit concerned . horizontal minima are measured between the centres of the primary returns and , where the returns are raw radar data ( not processed ) , they must not touch or overlap . when primary radar data are supplied , the horizontal separation must be measured using those primary data . however mats part 1 does permit ssr data to be used alone as a basis for providing horizontal separation between aircraft , in the following circumstances : `` ( i ) where this use has been approved by the authority . ( ii ) to overcome temporary deficiencies within primary radar cover , such as fading or clutter , the secondary return only of one aircraft may be used to provide separation from the primary or

or , in cases where the cas does not extend all the way to ground level , the radar return can be assumed to be an aircraft flying below the base of the cas .

-6secondary return of another aircraft provided the primary and secondary radar displays are correctly aligned . `` 5 ssr-only separation can not , however , be used `` if a controller has any doubt about the accuracy of the position of radar returns due to equipment malfunction , reflections or any other reason . '' the standards laid down by the caa safety regulation group ( srg ) in cap 670 air traffic services safety requirements specify that for a radar to be approved to provide 3nm separation between aircraft , it must have a 95 % or greater probability of resolving ( i.e . distinguishing between ) two targets which are 1nm apart over the whole of the radar 's required azimuth and range . to provide 5nm separation , it must be able to resolve two targets 3nm apart . types of radar service there are three types of radar service available to air traffic - radar control , radar advisory and radar information . a radar control service applies only in controlled airspace . under a radar control service , controllers issue heading and altitude instructions to pilots which must be obeyed by the pilots . these instructions are designed to ensure that standard vertical or horizontal separation is maintained between all aircraft . in normal circumstances , unidentified or unknown air traffic can be disregarded in this airspace since it is a 'known traffic environment ' where all aircraft in the controlled airspace are in contact with , or known to , the controller . in these circumstances , it can be assumed that unidentified radar returns are either not aircraft , or are aircraft operating outside ( e.g . below the base of ) the controlled airspace . a radar advisory service ( ras ) is available to aircraft flying under the instrument flight rules ( ifr ) 6 in uncontrolled airspace . under a ras , controllers pass information on other traffic to pilots receiving the service , and also advice on headings and/or altitudes to fly to maintain the standard 5nm or 3000ft separation from the other traffic . `` however , it is recognised that in the event of the sudden appearance of unknown traffic , and when unknown aircraft make unpredictable changes in flight path , it is not always possible to achieve these minima . `` 7 a radar information service ( ris ) is available to traffic flying under ifr or vfr ( visual flight rules ) . under a ris , controllers will pass information on the position and altitude of other traffic but will not issue advice on headings or altitudes to fly to avoid conflict . the crew of the aircraft retain responsibility for separation from the other traffic .

-7ras and ris may be limited by controllers when they judge that they can not meet the primary requirements of the service . mats part 1 specifies that the radar service should be limited when : `` ( a ) the aircraft is operating within 10 miles of : ( i ) the edge of the radar display . ( ii ) weather clutter , or ( iii ) permanent echoes . ( b ) the aircraft is operating in an area of high traffic density . ( c ) the aircraft is operating near to the limits of solid radar cover , or ( d ) the service is being provided using secondary radar only . `` 8 radar services to air traffic outside controlled airspace were reviewed in 1997 with the aim of ensuring that the standard of service provided was `` broadly identical ... regardless of whether the unit providing the service was civil or military . `` 9 while some differences still exist between civil and military atc practice , the standards and procedures relating to the provision of lars are common to civil and military units . according to hq raf strike command , raf units are no more or less likely to limit the radar service being provided to traffic in the presence of radar clutter than their civil counterparts . following some confusion about the status of a limited radar service , the caa issued supplementary advice in 2000 which states : `` limiting a service should not be viewed as a failure to provide the desired service but a useful and sensible way for a controller to indicate to a pilot that the full service can not be provided . however , the controller is still willing to offer assistance to fulfil the primary objectives of the service . `` 10

-84. discriminating aircraft from other radar returns the pulsed electromagnetic energy transmitted by radar will reflect off a wide variety of objects in its path . the size , shape , orientation and materials of the object will determine how much of the energy is absorbed , how much is reflected and in what directions it is reflected . objects which are moving will cause a shift in the frequency of the returned radio waves - an increased frequency for movement towards the radar , a reduced frequency for movement away from the radar . this is known as 'doppler shift ' . moving target indicator ( mti ) processing removes from the radar screen any returned pulses which either have the same frequency as the transmitted pulse ( indicating no movement ) or are within a specified range of doppler shift , corresponding to a range of speeds . these thresholds may be set to eliminate a variety of unwanted moving targets , such as rain and other precipitation , trees , the surface of the sea , and road traffic . mti processing is based on detecting and measuring the radial velocity of a target , i.e . the component of its velocity directed towards or away from the radar . a target which is travelling tangentially to the radar will have zero radial velocity and will therefore be detected as a stationary target and removed by the mti processor . aircraft flying tracks diagonal to the radar may only have radial velocities of a few tens of knots , which may be within the threshold speed set to eliminate road traffic , leading again to the elimination of a genuine target . further details of techniques for mitigating radar clutter are outlined in section 7 below . precipitation returns from weather regularly cause clutter on radar . areas of rain and other forms of precipitation may be visible , particularly to radars operating at higher frequencies since their waves will reflect more readily off objects as small as a raindrop . weather clutter will typically cover an area of several miles corresponding to the areas where rain is falling , and may be severe enough to prevent detection of aircraft within the area of clutter . aircraft - and wind turbines - usually appear as more clearly-defined point targets . air traffic radar controllers regularly vector traffic around weather clutter in order to maintain the visibility of the aircraft under their control and to ensure separation from any traffic which may be hidden by the clutter . older radars were generally more susceptible to weather clutter . the acr430 , for example , which was in use at a number of uk civil airfields , operated in the 3cm waveband , a higher frequency than most current aerodrome surveillance radars , and was highly vulnerable to weather clutter . in radars of this type , reducing the equipment 's susceptibility to displaying areas of precipitation by turning down the gain would often result in aircraft returns being lost in addition to the weather clutter . in these circumstances , controllers would limit the radar service provided , as outlined above . more

-9modern radars such as the watchman have improved ability to reduce the effects of weather , but measures taken to remove weather returns from the screen will generally also reduce the radar 's ability to detect and track aircraft targets within the area of precipitation . radar detection of precipitation is increasingly used for weather reporting and forecasting . in the usa , a network of dedicated radars is used for this purpose . in addition , most modern air traffic control primary surveillance radars developed to us federal aviation administration ( faa ) specifications have sophisticated digital signal processing which allows them to detect weather through one or more channels while simultaneously but separately displaying aircraft , with no weather clutter , through other channels . in the uk , the met office has a network of dedicated plessey 45c rainfall detection radars . these operate at frequencies approximately twice as high as typical air surveillance radars . met office radars are generally located on hill tops and are oriented so that the lower part of the antenna beam is at 0° elevation , thus any obstruction at a lower height than the antenna will not be illuminated . birds birds can have a radar cross-section of around 0.01 square metre , or approximately one hundredth of the radar cross-section of a small light aircraft . however birds are detectable on radar , particularly when they are travelling in flocks . their radar cross-section is largest in s-band , the frequency range used most commonly by aerodrome surveillance radars . flapping wings can create a doppler shift in the returned signal and can even be analysed in order to determine which species of bird is being detected . permanent echoes features such as prominent buildings , hilltops , masts and towers may be constantly visible on the radar screen and identifiable as a particular feature because of their known and static location . these 'permanent echoes ' ( pes ) will normally be filtered out by mti processing . however pes also provide controllers and engineers with a means of calibrating and monitoring the performance of the radar . cap 670 requires radar controllers or engineers to identify at least three pes , separated by at least 60° in azimuth , to check range and bearing error on analogue primary radars.11

- 10 5. wind turbine returns on radar rotating wind turbine blades can impart a doppler shift to any radar energy reflecting off the blades . the radar 's mti processor may - depending on the thresholds set in the processor - detect this as a non-static target and therefore display it as a return on the radar screen . variation in the wind direction at the turbine , the precise position of the blade in its rotation as the radar beam illuminates it , the pitch of the blade and other factors may cause the amplitude and size of the return to fluctuate from one antenna rotation to another . at sites with single turbines , any radar return from the rotating turbine blades will stay in one location on the screen . however at sites with more than one turbine , the radar may illuminate a blade or blades from one turbine on one antenna sweep , then illuminate the blades of a different turbine on the next sweep . this can create the appearance on the radar screen of returns moving about within the area of the wind farm over time , sometimes described as a `` twinkling '' appearance . the extent to which this will happen will depend on , amongst other factors , the radar 's range and azimuth resolution - the minimum distance between objects which the radar can detect . during consultations for this study , several controllers referred to wind turbine returns as being `` treated as '' or `` like '' permanent echoes . in these cases , the returns were either static , or shifting on the radar screen by a small enough distance to be considered as remaining in one location . as noted above , regulatory requirements dictate that primary radar displays must have at least three pes visible on screen in order to provide a means for controllers and engineers to monitor the range and bearing accuracy of the radar . the ability of wind turbines to perform this role will depend on the extent to which the turbine returns are static and consistently visible . this in turn will be dependent on several factors including the number of turbines , their azimuth extent , their range from the radar , and the effects of wind direction and speed on turbine visibility . airspace wind turbine returns on radar have a much more significant effect when the turbines are located within uncontrolled airspace than when they are situated within or underneath controlled airspace . this is because unknown returns appearing in or underneath controlled airspace can be assumed not to be aircraft , since if they were aircraft their pilots would have contacted the air traffic control agency for that airspace to request a permission to enter . most air traffic inside controlled airspace is flying according to the instrument flight rules ( ifr ) . aircraft flying under ifr in controlled airspace are provided with standard separation from other ifr traffic by air traffic controllers . in the majority of cases this separation is provided by means of radar . in uncontrolled airspace , aircraft may fly without contacting any air traffic control agency . there are two principal types of traffic in uncontrolled airspace in the uk : military aircraft , many of them operating at low altitude , and civil light aircraft . these two categories of traffic are predominantly flying according to the visual flight rules ( vfr ) , under which pilots are responsible

- 11 for maintaining their own separation from other aircraft by seeing and avoiding them . airliners and other commercial aircraft also transit uncontrolled airspace in some areas . although flying ifr , the pilots of these aircraft are responsible for seeing and avoiding other traffic since they are in uncontrolled airspace . however , since they may be flying in cloud or poor visibility , their ability to see and avoid may be poor or non-existent . consequently commercial traffic flying in uncontrolled airspace will in almost every case make use of a radar service to provide advice and/or information on other traffic in the area . over much of the country , this radar service is provided by radar-equipped civil and military airfields under formal contract . this is known as the lower airspace radar service ( lars ) . radar services to aircraft in uncontrolled airspace are also available from other air traffic control units , controller workload permitting . proximity to traffic patterns and instrument procedures the operational significance of any unwanted returns on radar will depend not only on the type of airspace within which , or underneath which , they are located , but also on their proximity to inbound and outbound traffic routes , holding patterns , and instrument approach procedures . thus , wind turbines located on the extended centreline of a runway at a radar-equipped airfield are likely to be regarded as a significant problem for controllers . turbines located under standard instrument departure ( sid ) and standard arrival ( star ) routes may also be considered problematic , although the effects may be limited by the fact that sids and stars are contained within controlled airspace . secondary surveillance radar ( ssr ) the discussion so far in this section has related exclusively to primary radar . some concerns have also been expressed by the ministry of defence , the irish aviation authority and other bodies about the impact of wind turbines on ssr . however , experience from other countries ( see below ) indicates that wind turbine effects on ssr are limited to the physical blanking and diffracting effects of the turbine towers , and that these effects are only a consideration when the turbines are located very close to the ssr . rotating turbine blades are not considered to have a significant impact on ssr performance due to their low cross-section relative to the size of the beam , and the fact that the returned ssr signal has much higher power than a returned primary radar pulse since it is re-transmitted from the aircraft rather than simply reflected . in the uk , nats treats wind turbine proposals within line of sight of ssrs in the same way as it would treat any static physical obstruction . the caa safeguarding criteria for ssrs require rejection of , or consultation on , any proposed development infringing a 1:200 slope from the antenna , out to a range of 4.6km.12 ssr is therefore unlikely to feature as a significant barrier to wind power development in the uk . unlike countries such as denmark and the netherlands , en route traffic over most of the uk is controlled using both primary and secondary radar , usually

- 12 co-located . this is considered necessary because the uk 's more mountainous terrain restricts radar coverage , requiring more radar stations to provide reliable coverage , and because air traffic density is higher in many parts of the uk . the 3nm separation standards applied in most control zones and terminal control areas in the uk are only regarded as being feasible if primary radar is available for verification and as a back-up should ssr fail . the uk also has large areas of uncontrolled airspace where some traffic may not be transponder-equipped . primary and secondary coverage is essential for provision of radar services in those areas . in parts of the uk with lower traffic levels , radar services may be provided using ssr only . this applies to predominantly transatlantic traffic at high altitudes off north west scotland and over south west england , using ssrs at stornoway and burrington respectively . the predictable nature of this traffic allows a service to be provided without primary radar . minimum horizontal separation standards when ssr is used without primary radar are increased to 5nm or 10nm . this is to ensure that separation can be maintained by other means ( such as vertically , or by time separation between following flights ) should the ssr fail .

- 13 6. operational experience in the uk there are numerous cases of wind turbines in the uk which are located within line-of-sight of radars . 6.1 civil airfields leeds-bradford the 23 wind turbines on the ovenden moor site in west yorkshire lie 20km south west of leeds-bradford airport . ovenden moor is one of the oldest established wind farms in the uk , having been commissioned in june 1993. the turbines are visible at all times to the airport 's watchman primary surveillance radar as a group of returns . no special processing is applied in the radar to reduce or eliminate the wind turbine returns . a large proportion of leeds-bradford 's inbound commercial traffic flies a route from the pole hill vor beacon towards the airport . this route takes aircraft directly over the wind farm . ifr traffic is kept inside controlled airspace as it crosses this area . the base of controlled airspace above ovenden moor is at 3000ft amsl . local light aircraft and military fast jets regularly fly in the uncontrolled airspace below 3000ft in this area . some of this traffic will appear as primary-only contacts on radar , as do the ovenden moor wind turbines . the radar returns from inbound ifr traffic regularly pass through the clutter created by the ovenden moor turbine returns . however the aircraft return always remains distinguishable from the clutter . controllers at leedsbradford do not limit the service provided to traffic overflying the area of clutter caused by the wind farm . in addition to aircraft flying over the wind farm within controlled airspace , leeds-bradford provides radar services to traffic in uncontrolled airspace up to 42.5nm from the airport . high ground to the west of the airport means that these services are subject to minimum altitude restrictions to the west . controllers at leeds-bradford do not attempt to provide standard 5nm horizontal separation from the clutter created by the ovenden moor wind turbines when providing a radar service to traffic in the vicinity of the turbines . four wind turbines were commissioned at chelker reservoir , 20km nw of leeds-bradford airport , in december 1992. they may also be partly visible to the airport 's radar . these turbines are within 3nm of the instrument approach procedures for runway 14 at leeds-bradford , and are in an area where ifr traffic may be descending below controlled airspace and may therefore be in airspace also containing unknown traffic . radar clutter caused by wind turbines in this area might be regarded as requiring measures to separate traffic from the unknown returns . the extent of the visibility of these turbines from the leeds-bradford radar , and whether they are treated in the same way as the ovenden moor turbines , is not known .

- 14 aircraft in the vicinity of both the chelker reservoir and ovenden moor turbines include low level military traffic transiting north-south in a narrow corridor over the pennines . these aircraft are not in radio contact with leedsbradford and generally do not appear on their radar unless they have their transponders switched on . according to caa srg inspectors responsible for regulation of air traffic services provision at leeds-bradford , no concerns have been raised about the effects of the wind turbines on leeds-bradford 's radar , either through personal contact or through formal reporting mechanisms such as the mandatory occurrence reporting ( mor ) scheme . prestwick airport prestwick airport 's marconi en4000 primary surveillance radar is line of sight to two operational wind farms - hare hill , 17.5nm to the south east , and windy standard , 19nm away , also to the south east . neither wind farm was visible on the prestwick radar until a major upgrade of the equipment was completed in autumn 2000. since then , both wind farms have been visible to varying degrees . hare hill lies on the extended centreline of prestwick 's main runway , 31. all 20 turbines are visible to the radar , creating an area of primary returns extending up to 1.5nm across and 1.5nm deep . within this area , individual returns appear intermittently , giving the appearance of a 'twinkling ' effect . this could give the appearance of a primary-only target moving across the area between one sweep of the radar and the next . six of the turbines on the windy standard site are wholly or partially visible to the prestwick radar . however the return from the turbines always appears as a stationary object , with no obvious signs of movement . the reasons for the appearance of the windy standard turbines as a stationary return while hare hill presents a shifting radar image are not known and may be the subject of further investigation . however it is believed that the temporal threshold filtering process of the radar may be responsible for the fluctuating visibility of hare hill . this process is performed after the basic mti function has deleted all static targets . the purpose of temporal threshold processing is to deal with static or slow-moving targets which mti has failed to eliminate from the screen . these are targets which have some motion , but which remain in the same location – such as a hovering helicopter , or swaying trees in a high wind . rotating wind turbines may continue to appear since the moving blades will impart a phase shift to the returned radar pulses in the same way as a genuine moving target . temporal threshold processing analyses the clutter level in each temporal cell ( which consists of a number of individual rangeazimuth cells ) over successive antenna sweeps . if targets which have some doppler content , but which do not move outside the boundaries of the cell , appear in a temporal cell the radar processor will raise the clutter threshold by a specified amount , in order to attempt to eliminate the unwanted targets .

- 15 -

the prestwick radar takes a full 32 sweeps of the antenna to complete adjustment of the clutter threshold levels . if the strength of the wind turbine returns is sufficiently large , the processor will progressively raise the threshold until the clutter is deleted . in the case of wind turbine returns , it is believed that shifts in wind direction or lack of coincidence between blade orientation and radar sweep result in an absence of hits from the turbine blades , causing the temporal threshold filter to reset to zero . it will then recommence adjustment of the threshold as turbine returns appear again . prestwick airport has no controlled airspace in its vicinity below 5500 feet . the area to the south and south-east of the airport is in regular use as a military low flying training area . this is also the sector from which most of prestwick 's inbound commercial traffic arrives . these arriving aircraft are required to descend into uncontrolled airspace for some 20nm before reaching the prestwick aerodrome traffic zone . this places these aircraft in an air traffic environment where unknown traffic may appear with short notice , the worst case scenario – in terms of the potential consequences – being a military jet pulling out of the low flying system , for example due to deteriorating weather , and initiating a rapid climb to safety altitude . these conflicting aircraft may be invisible to the prestwick radar due to intervening terrain when they commence their pull-out . the prestwick airport authorities have expressed concern that clutter from a wind farm could hide unknown traffic of this type for a crucial period , preventing controllers from issuing timely warnings to traffic to whom they are providing a service . air traffic controllers at prestwick airport have obtained caa approval for two procedures to mitigate this risk around the hare hill wind farm . the procedure preferred by prestwick is to vector all traffic around the clutter by 5nm in order to maintain standard separation from any aircraft which might appear from within the area of clutter . the other procedure is to route aircraft over , or closer than 5nm to , the wind farm area , but to formally limit the radar service provided . this will usually consist of advice to the pilot that there may be late warning , or no warning , of conflicting traffic from below due to an area of radar clutter . the official caa circular on this topic advises that `` the pilot is expected to take the warning into account in his general airmanship . `` 13 this would normally include increased visual lookout for any conflicting traffic if the aircraft is not flying in cloud . as outlined above , limitation of a radar service is regularly employed by radar units for a variety of reasons and is accepted as an inevitable consequence of the technical limitations of radar . in prestwick 's case , while the problem is highlighted by the location of hare hill directly under the main approach path to the airport , there are a number of circumstances which will mitigate the risk in practice : • the probability of a military jet making its first appearance on radar when directly over the wind farm is extremely small given the number of low

- 16 level flights in this area and the frequency with which low level pull-outs occur ; because of the speed of jet aircraft , traffic is unlikely to be illuminated by the radar for more than one sweep of the antenna while over the wind farm ; for a problem to exist as a result of an aircraft appearing on radar for the first time as it crosses the wind farm , the controller would have to be looking at that part of the screen at the time the aircraft was crossing the wind farm ; 14 military aircraft are required `` whenever possible '' to have their ssr transponders switched on when operating in the low flying system.15 because of the higher power of the returned signal , ssr returns are usually visible at longer ranges and lower altitudes than primary returns . this will mean that controllers may be alerted to the presence of unknown traffic before the primary return appears ; if an unknown aircraft flying across the wind farm area is displaying an ssr return , it will be more visible on the screen and less likely to be lost in the clutter .

the viability of mitigation procedures such as those adopted by prestwick depends on site-specific circumstances . while procedural measures may be possible for one wind farm , airspace constraints may preclude adoption of similar measures in relation to any additional wind farms . viability will also depend on the location of the wind farm relative to runway orientation , approach and departure paths , instrument approach procedures , navigation aids and holding patterns . aberdeen airport a single wind turbine has been in operation at bogfechel farm , whiterashes , under the final approach track to the main runway at aberdeen airport , since the mid-1980s . the turbine is believed to be partially visible to the nats plessey watchman radar on perwinnes hill , 7.2km se of the wind turbine . perwinnes hill supplies primary and secondary data to controllers at aberdeen airport and to the scottish area control centre at prestwick . primary data from perwinnes hill received at aberdeen airport has already been processed , with both mti and plot extraction applied to remove ground clutter and successive plots not meeting specified criteria for the formation of tracks . no returns from the area of the turbine have been noted by controllers at aberdeen . however , the visibility of the turbine from the radar head has not been definitively established , and since the turbine is not in continuous operation it may be less apparent to controllers .

- 17 newcastle airport a three-turbine wind farm became operational at kirkheaton , just under 10nm nw of newcastle airport , and just outside newcastle 's controlled airspace , in may 2000. the project was submitted to consultation with both the caa and the mod with no objections raised . newcastle operates a marconi s511 hybrid primary surveillance radar . the kirkheaton wind farm appears intermittently on the radar display . with some clutter suppression applied , the turbines appear in a similar way to a permanent echo , with variation in visibility believed to be due to atmospheric conditions . however the return is not regarded as significant since the echo is small and well known , and has not caused any difficulties for atc staff . the location of the wind farm only 2nm beyond the newcastle control zone boundary and in the narrow gap between newcastle 's controlled airspace and the raf spadeadam electronic warfare training range danger area , is of significant interest to newcastle atc , in particular due to their lower airspace radar service responsibilities . low level military fast jet traffic is common in this region and a significant amount of light civilian traffic , including training aircraft from newcastle , use this airspace . there have been several aircraft proximity hazard ( 'airprox ' ) incidents involving civil and military aircraft in the uncontrolled airspace beyond newcastle 's control zone in recent years , including one in october 1999 , shortly before the kirkheaton wind farm was built , when an raf tornado attempting to reach spadeadam in poor weather flew close to the boundary of controlled airspace and within 1nm of an airliner on approach to newcastle . the tornado subsequently crashed only 2km from the wind farm site . in the light of this it could be expected that anything which might have a detrimental effect on radar performance in this area would generate a negative response from controllers . cardiff airport the taff ely wind farm - a 20-turbine development - was established in 1993. it lies 10.8nm nw of cardiff airport , within line of sight of the airport 's marconi 511 radar . atc management advise that the wind farm is visible on their radar display `` occasionally , in certain atmospheric conditions '' , but that it has not caused any operational problems for air traffic at cardiff . taff ely is in uncontrolled airspace and is not under any of the airport 's instrument approach procedures . however , the wind farm is within the airport 's radar vectoring area ( rva ) , and is marked on both the rva chart , and on the airport 's instrument approach charts as a 1184ft unlit multiple obstruction . when cardiff traffic is landing on runway 12 ( from the west ) , the wind farm lies under the tracks flown by aircraft inbound to cardiff from the north via the brecon navigation aid on airway alpha 25 , and from the west via reporting point amman on airway golf one . scheduled commercial traffic using these routes includes some 15 flights a day from scotland , ireland and the north of england .

- 18 cardiff airport also provides approach radar services for nearby raf st athan . st athan arrivals from the north may also be vectored close to taff ely . caa srg staff responsible for inspection and approval of cardiff airport 's atc services are aware of the wind farm 's existence , but no concerns have been raised about possible effects of the wind turbines on the radar services provided by cardiff . glasgow airport the former national engineering laboratory has operated a wind turbine trials site on myres hill , 12.2 nm from glasgow airport and within the glasgow ctr , since the 1980s . the turbines are believed to be line of sight to glasgow 's radar . atc personnel at glasgow advise that the turbines have not caused any problems . no objections were raised by glasgow airport or the caa to a more recent proposal to develop a commercial wind farm at this location . norwich airport the somerton wind turbine is visible on norwich airport 's radar . the ats manager at norwich believes that the multiple turbines at blood hill are not visible . the return from somerton , which is 11.5nm from the norwich radar , is visible intermittently , and appears to move around by 0.25-0.5nm , making it appear similar to a light aircraft return in some circumstances . the movement appears to be because the turbine is situated on the boundary of two rangeazimuth cells . once the controllers had become accustomed to the turbine 's appearance on radar , they have had no difficulty in recognising its returns . traffic is quite dense in this area , but the wind farm is not under norwich 's final approach track or procedures . radar services are not limited in the vicinity of the turbine returns . belfast airport the elliott 's hill wind farm , consisting of 10 turbines , lies 10nm nne of belfast airport . the turbine tips are 900ft higher than the airfield and the turbines are visible from the airport by eye . belfast has a marconi en4000 with a watchman antenna ( similar to the equipment at prestwick ) . the turbines do not appear on the radar . the airport 's atc engineering manager believed this could be because the turbines are just below the radar antenna beam , which is set at 1.5° in order to reduce the effects of clutter from the ridge of high ground 7nm east of the airport . most traffic using belfast is arriving from the east and south so elliott 's hill is not in a sector of major interest to controllers ; nor is it under any of the instrument approaches , so the precise reasons for its non appearance have not been investigated .

raf marham raf marham 's watchman radar has a clear view of the full rotor disc of the single e66 turbine on the north side of swaffham , norfolk . however the turbine only shows intermittently on the radar , and the returns from the turbine do not present any difficulties to air traffic controllers at marham . no special processing has been applied to the marham watchman radar to reduce the turbine 's signature . raf marham had intended to object to the construction of the swaffham turbine when it was proposed , but their objection was submitted too late to be considered in the planning process . however the basis for the objection was not the possible effects on radar , but the fact that an unlit 300ft+ structure in this area could be an obstruction hazard to low flying aircraft . rnas culdrose a 14-turbine wind farm was established 3.5nm from rnas culdrose 's watchman radar in 1993. the following year , the raf signals engineering establishment carried out a trial to assess the impact of the wind farm on the radar . the report of the trials concluded that the wind farm had a negative impact on the radar 's performance , notably in degrading the ability to track aircraft targets over the wind farm area . the report 's conclusions have since formed much of the basis for the ministry of defence 's policy in relation to wind farms visible to radars.16 two features of the culdrose study are notable : • the goonhilly turbines are only 3.5 to 3.8nm from the rnas culdrose radar , a much shorter distance than most other wind turbine-radar situations , at least in the uk . • the raf see trials did not consider whether the radar returns from the wind turbines were operationally significant . consultations with air traffic control personnel at rnas culdrose have determined that the turbines remain visible on the station 's radar . however , suppression of the returns from the wind farm region is applied using rag ( range azimuth gate ) mapping techniques . with suppression applied , atcos have experienced `` some degradation '' of radar performance in the region around the wind farm . the extent and nature of the degradation is unknown , but is being monitored by atc staff at culdrose as part of an ongoing raf see ( now dcsa ( dei ) ) interest in this case . according to rnas culdrose , any degradation of radar performance that does exist is insignificant operationally since the bulk of the traffic operating in the area around the wind farm is vfr and the location is well away from the airfield 's instrument procedures . no special measures are applied to route aircraft away from the wind farm , and published procedures for rnas culdrose make no reference to radar performance degradation due to the wind turbines , though they are listed as a vertical obstruction .

on the second aspect of radar performance degradation identified in the 1994 raf see report - the possible shadowing of targets behind the wind farm satco culdrose advised that the evidence is unclear . targets operating in this area - typically , helicopters operating at low level over the sea in excess of 7 nautical miles from culdrose - do appear on the culdrose watchman . however , since this is an area where aircraft may be operating autonomously , not under culdrose 's control , it has not been possible to assess whether the radar is seeing all targets flying in this region , and if not , whether any loss of targets is due to the wind farm . raf st mawgan two wind farms have been in operation within line of sight of raf st mawgan 's primary surveillance radar since the early 1990s - carland cross , a 15-turbine site 5.3 nm from st mawgan , and st breock , an 11-turbine development 8.2nm from the base 's radar . in addition a third , 16-turbine development has been approved , following detailed consultations with mod technical authorities , on bear 's down , 4nm from st mawgan 's radar . images of the st mawgan radar display taken in january 2001 show that the delabole wind farm , 17nm nne of st mawgan , is also visible to the radar . since the construction of carland cross and st breock and the approval of bear 's down , st mawgan has replaced its ar15 surveillance radar with a watchman . this has recently been upgraded with colour raster scan displays . satco raf st mawgan advised that both st breock and carland cross were visible on the ar15 display and now show more clearly on the watchman . both sites are treated as permanent echoes , but mti processing does not remove their returns . the precise effect for aircraft targets crossing the wind farms was not known since the new colour displays had only been installed recently . further suppression measures were thought to be possible but the satco noted that st mawgan frequently provides radar services to aircraft ne of the base and the cumulative impact of suppression of both st breock and bear 's down might degrade this service . at present , however , the deputy satco at raf st mawgan advises that `` although the [ wind ] farms paint quite effectively on radar we do not find that they cause any major problems for our controlling ... we count the farms as permanent echoes and do not avoid them as radar contacts . we do , however , limit service when close to them in case 'pop up ' traffic appears in that area . '' raf coltishall the blood hill wind turbines lie 11.6nm from the radar at raf coltishall ; the single somerton turbine is 11.2nm from coltishall . the deputy satco at raf coltishall , which provides area radar services to civil and military traffic in the area , confirmed that returns from the turbines are visible on their watchman radar , but do not affect atc operations . the return is very small , remains static , and is present for 95 to 99 % of the time . this may indicate that only the single turbine at somerton is visible . the position of the return was plotted as a permanent echo when the turbine was built .

trimingham nats operates an en route radar facility at trimingham , near cromer on the norfolk coast , providing a radar service ( anglia radar ) primarily for helicopters operating to and from offshore installations in the southern north sea . the radar is 17nm from the blood hill and somerton wind farms . anglia radar 's controllers are based at aberdeen airport and use data derived from several radar heads including claxby , near market rasen in lincolnshire , and trimingham . raw returns from the primary radar are processed to provide correlation with ssr data and to reduce the size of the returns . the blood hill/somerton wind turbines paint intermittently on the trimingham radar in the form of small points . the return occasionally shifts laterally , possibly indicating alternate illumination of different turbines . the maximum lateral distance over which the turbine returns may be visible is less than one nautical mile . the turbine returns are well known and recognised by controllers and are not regarded as presenting any difficulties to the controllers ' task . most traffic in the immediate area is helicopters following recognised and regular tracks , and all traffic to which a service is being provided will be transponding . low level military fast jet traffic is also common in the area but the vast majority of this traffic is also transponding . the turbine returns do not constitute a significant enough area of clutter to warrant limiting the radar service to transponding traffic . however controllers might limit the service to traffic for which only primary radar data was available ( i.e . aircraft which do not carry an ssr transponder or do not have it switched on ) . lowther hill the nats en route radar on lowther hill is line of sight to two wind farms windy standard ( 15.5 nm ) and hagshaw hill ( 12 nm ) . nats engineering and operational support personnel at the scottish area control centre ( scacc ) advise that no concerns have been raised about returns from these wind farms . recent upgrades of the mti software on the lowther hill radar have improved its ability to filter out road traffic which may also assist in suppressing any wind turbine returns . however no specific processing has

- 22 been applied to this or any other nats en route radars to mitigate any effects from wind turbines . the lowther hill radar antenna is located approximately 2400ft above sea level . since it is an en route radar , it is optimised for coverage of higher altitudes . nats engineering staff report that the hagshaw hill turbines ( blade tip heights up to 1720ft amsl ) may be below the antenna beam coverage from lowther hill , in which case they would not be illuminated by the radar and would not appear on the radar screens . during the planning consultations for the windy standard wind farm scacc is understood to have considered applying a limitation to the lowther hill radar antenna beam elevation in order to prevent the radar illuminating the turbines , if interference was found to be a problem . however no such limitation has been applied . the windy standard turbines extend to a maximum height of 2406ft amsl . secondary surveillance radar data from lowther hill is also supplied to a number of third parties including prestwick and edinburgh airports . reflection of ssr signals by a wind turbine more than 10nm away is considered by nats radar engineering staff to be very unlikely and no problems have been reported . nats practice is to assess potential wind turbine effects on ssr purely in terms of the static obstruction presented by the turbines , in the same way as electricity pylons or radio masts would be assessed . rotating turbine blades are not considered to have a detrimental effect on ssr .

- 23 7. operational experience outside the uk 7.1 netherlands amsterdam ( schiphol ) airport fourteen turbines with a maximum blade height of 89m were constructed in the amsterdam western harbour area , 10km north of schiphol airport , in 2000-2001. the turbines are all located within controlled airspace . they are positioned under the final approach path to runway 19l at schiphol . this runway is only used for landings in daylight visual conditions ( no night or instrument approaches permitted ) , but a surveillance radar approach is available which involves radar vectoring to a point approximately two nautical miles from touchdown . in addition , the radar at schiphol , which is located on top of the elevated control tower at the airport , is estimated to be line of sight to : • four 53m turbines in controlled airspace at haarlem , 15km nw • five 45m turbines outside controlled airspace at velsen , 20km nw • ten 100m turbines outside controlled airspace at flevoland , 25km ene . according to the dutch air traffic control authority , lvnl , there have been no indications to date that any of the above wind turbines appear on their radar . lvnl is aware of the theoretical possibilities of diffraction , screening and false returns due to rotating turbine blades , but none of these effects have been experienced . in the case of the western harbour turbines , the dutch planning consultation process , which requires developers to consult the airport if proposing construction in the vicinity , failed to alert the authority to the proposal . however no effects have been experienced . schiphol 's primary radar is an alenia atcr-33k , with a g-33 antenna . this is a relatively modern radar although it is the klystron-based ( not solid state ) version of the atcr-33 , which has less capability at eliminating clutter . the atcr-33 employs mtd processing and incorporates several clutter maps . these processes are effective at eliminating moving returns from road traffic around schiphol as well as the wind turbines . leerdam one of the most important en route radar facilities in the netherlands is located at leerdam , south of utrecht . in the late 1990s , when the luchtverkeersleiding ( lvnl - dutch air traffic control authority ) was planning replacement of the ssr equipment at leerdam with new mode s radars , a proposal was made for a wind farm close to the site . the closest turbine would have been 1.1 km from the radar and the wind farm would have extended over azimuth angles of up to 55° and elevation angles up to 2.3° as viewed from the radar . lvnl asked the two leading manufacturers of ssr , raytheon systems and airsys atm , to assess the likely impact of the proposed turbines on the leerdam ssr .

- 24 raytheon systems engineers predicted that diffraction of the ssr signal by the turbine towers could cause azimuth inaccuracies on aircraft targets in the area up to 3° either side of each wind turbine tower , and some obscuration of targets behind the wind turbines . raytheon recommended that the turbines be placed further away from the radar and that they should be realigned to present less of an azimuth extent to the radar , for example by aligning turbines one behind the other along a radial from the radar . the assessment only considered the effects on ssr of the static tower structure of the turbines . the rotating turbine blades were not considered to have any obscuration effects since any scattering or reflection would be fleeting and would only affect a small proportion of the radar beam 's energy . military air bases primary surveillance radars at the dutch air force bases at leeuwarden , twenthe and soesterberg are affected to varying degrees by wind turbines within line of sight . the primary radar equipment at these airfields is the raytheon asr-910b which is a 20-year-old design . woensdrecht air base , in the south of the country , which currently has no radar , may be affected in future if proposed installation of a raytheon asr-10ss primary radar goes ahead . woensdrecht has two multiple turbine wind farms within 12km and four within 25km . at leeuwarden , in friesland , there are four multiple-turbine wind farms within 15km of the base . concerns about the impact of these turbines on radar coverage of low level traffic beyond the turbines led the dutch air force to commission research on the problem from the fel-tno research agency in the hague . fel-tno 's research focused on the 'shadow ' effect on radar coverage behind a wind turbine , using a computer program which predicts the forward scattering by turbines . however the research did not investigate the impact of the rotating turbine blades on radar performance since the radars under consideration were non-coherent and regarded as not susceptible to signal back-scattering by rotating blades . the practical effects on the radar at leeuwarden do not include difficulties in tracking aircraft crossing overhead the areas of the wind turbines . a contract to upgrade the existing raytheon asr-910b aerodrome surveillance radars at military air bases in the netherlands is currently under consideration . replacement is not , however , driven by the desire to overcome problems created by wind turbines . 7.2 denmark denmark has the highest concentration of wind turbines of any country in the world . data obtained from vane consulting in denmark indicates that there are 1811 existing wind turbines within 30km of air traffic control radars in

- 25 denmark , and a further 570 turbines within 30km of five gci ( air defence ) radar stations . these figures include substantial numbers of single turbines which mostly have tower heights less than 30m . however due to the predominantly flat terrain in denmark , even these smaller turbines are likely to be visible to radars . full consultation with all radar-equipped airports in denmark was beyond the scope of this study . however , consultations with the regulatory authority , statens luftfartsvaesen ( slv ) , the air traffic control provider , flyvesikringstjenesten , and danish wind industry companies and consultants , produced a unanimous response that wind turbines presented no difficulties to air traffic control radar operations . kastrup copenhagen international airport at kastrup , south east of the city , has 71 wind turbines within 30km . these include : • 15 turbines at avedore , between 10.4 and 13.1 km west of the airport • the 20 offshore wind turbines of the middelgrunden project , 100m in height , between 6.4 and 10.0 km nne of the airport • seven turbines at lynetten , on the edge of copenhagen harbour , 9km north of the airport • eight turbines at dragør , on the southern airfield boundary , only 4km from the airport 's primary radar , less than 2km from its secondary surveillance radar , and adjacent to the airport 's principal radio navigation aid , the kastrup vor . the middelgrunden turbines , completed in 2000 , lie directly under the missed approach path for runway 04 and under the instrument approach procedures for runway 22. avedore lies under the instrument procedure for runway 12. kastrup 's primary radar is a texas instruments ( westinghouse ) asr-8 , with an airsys atm tpr-1000 track processor . the tpr-1000 performs plot extraction , track correlation and primary-secondary plot correlation functions . according to the flyvesikringstjenesten engineering manager for the kastrup radar , while the raw output from the asr-8 may be able to detect wind turbines , the tpr-1000 will process them out . wind turbines consequently have `` no effect whatsoever '' on the radar display at kastrup . this is also true for the thomson-csf rsm 970 ssr which is located at the southern end of the airport , less than 2km from the dragør wind farm . aalborg the airport at aalborg is a joint civil/military facility , with regular scheduled services and fighter jet operations . there are currently 425 wind turbines at distances ranging from 3km to 30km from the airport . these include several large groups of turbines immediately south of the approach path to the main runway , 26 , at a range of 6.5 to 7 nm , several turbines under the instrument approach procedures for runway 08 , and numerous turbines under the vfr approach routes to the airfield from the north .

- 26 other radar-equipped airports in denmark with wind turbines within 30km are aarhus ( tirstrup ) , billund , karup , skrydstrup/vojens , roskilde and vaerloese . uk caa srg officials have pointed out that policies on air traffic management in denmark are different from those in the uk and that this may account for denmark 's greater willingness to accept wind turbines . the key differences are , first , that denmark does not use primary radar for en route air traffic control , relying solely on ssr for this task . ssr is less vulnerable to wind turbine effects . second , srg would not permit plot extraction over areas of clutter in the way that kastrup does . further evidence on the comparison of danish and uk regulatory policy in this area is required , notably on the experience of airports other than kastrup , the acceptability in practice of plot extraction in en route radars and in controlled airspace in the uk , and danish radar coverage of traffic outside controlled airspace . 7.3 usa stockton , california raytheon canada have installed an all solid state s-band asr-10 radar for the federal aviation administration ( faa ) at a site near stockton , east of san francisco . the radar is within line of sight of a number of wind turbines . according to raytheon systems and the faa , although the radar employs digital processing , it has only three doppler filters and has not been entirely successful in filtering out wind turbine returns . raytheon engineers also found that the wind turbines had a slight skewing effect on the radar 's antenna beam , causing some azimuth errors . palm springs , california a new northrop-grumman asr-9 primary surveillance radar became operational at palm springs in january 2001. this replaced an asr-8 which had suffered considerable problems due to clutter from the many wind turbines in the palm springs area . wind turbine clutter had led to limitation of radar service to aircraft in the areas around the wind turbines . the asr-9 was the first radar to use mtd technology , providing a vast increase in performance over mti radars . the asr-9 at palm springs has modifications applied which originated from faa engineering research to deal with radar clutter from migratory birds in the san francisco area . the modifications in the palm springs radar include dynamic clutter mapping and six doppler filters , providing much enhanced sensitivity to moving clutter at different velocities . air traffic controllers at palm springs are now able to vector traffic across the wind turbines without any detrimental effect on radar performance since the turbines no longer appear on the radar screen . no limitation of radar service is required .

- 27 edwards air force base the tehachapi pass in california , on the north west edge of the mojave desert , has the highest concentration of wind turbines in the usa . edwards air force base , home of the air force flight test center ( afftc ) , lies 20nm south east of tehachapi pass . afftc 's extensive facilities include multiple test areas and ranges to support the usaf 's aircraft , equipment and weapons test and evaluation activities . among these facilities are three low level flight routes across the tehachapi pass for test aircraft . a further three low level routes run across the pass , used by air national guard c-130s , us navy f18s and us marine corps aircraft .

- 28 8. mitigation techniques 8.1 radar processing primary radars will detect any targets which meet the thresholds , or criteria , set in the radar 's processing . radar performance is determined by the balance between the probability of detecting wanted targets ( probability of detection , pd ) and the probability of detecting unwanted or false targets . the ratio between these two probabilities is known as the false alarm rate . measures to increase the probability of detecting wanted targets may also increase the probability of false or unwanted detections . a number of measures can be used to improve a radar 's ability to discriminate between wanted and unwanted targets . amplitude thresholds if the unwanted targets ( such as rain or birds ) are expected to have a lower radar cross-section than the desired targets , the amplitude of the unwanted returns can be expected to be lower than that of the genuine targets . a voltage threshold can be set in the radar causing returns below a given amplitude to be ignored . however , wind turbines can have radar crosssections larger than aircraft targets so this method has very limited utility . range-azimuth gating ( rag ) this process identifies particular range-azimuth cells , or groups of cells , within which returns are suppressed . rag usually involves suppression of all returns from the identified cells , creating a hole in the radar cover . constant false alarm rate a development of the amplitude threshold method is to apply thresholds which will maintain a constant false alarm rate ( cfar ) . this process , also known as temporal threshold processing , is designed to maintain radar performance in areas where there is clutter . a threshold is set for a group of range-azimuth cells . if the largest return from that area in one antenna sweep is of greater amplitude than the largest return from the previous antenna sweep , the threshold is increased to try to eliminate the clutter . after several antenna revolutions the threshold will rise sufficiently to eliminate the clutter . this process is quite effective in removing shifting clutter returns from the radar screen . however , if a desired target within the area has a weaker return than the clutter , or if it stays within the area for several antenna sweeps ( as for example a hovering or slow-moving helicopter might ) , the clutter threshold will eliminate that genuine target as well as the clutter . doppler discrimination radars can discriminate between wanted moving targets and unwanted static or slow-moving targets by processing out those that do not exceed a given radial velocity . this is done by detecting differences in the phase - doppler shift - of consecutive return pulses received by the radar . leaving aside aircraft flying tangentially to the radar , which will have a low radial velocity , most clutter will have lower doppler values than aircraft returns . however ,

- 29 wind turbines are problematic since blade tip speeds may be as much as 120 knots , similar to the speed of a light aircraft or helicopter . there are two established methods of doppler processing in radars to suppress slow-moving or static clutter while maintaining detection of aircraft . moving target indication ( mti ) mti processes several consecutive returned pulses . the output of this process identifies any object with zero doppler , i.e . which is static , and can then eliminate that object from the radar display . basic mti can only eliminate static objects . adaptive mti ( amti ) not only filters out the fixed clutter , but also estimates the predominant doppler value of the remaining , moving clutter in each range-azimuth cell , and filters it out . amti can therefore cancel out moving as well as fixed clutter . moving target detection ( mtd ) mtd is also based on analysing the characteristics of a series of consecutive returned pulses . mtd has the ability to generate a number of filters corresponding to different velocity ranges , thus giving the radar greater ability to discriminate between returns with different velocities . however both mti and mtd are dependent on there being some measurable difference in the doppler values of genuine targets and those of any clutter or unwanted targets . greater discrimination between different doppler values requires a higher pulse repetition frequency ( prf ) . because correct measurement of range depends on a returned pulse being received before the next pulse is transmitted , the higher the prf , the lower will be the maximum unambiguous range of the radar . thus mtd is usually less suitable for en route radars , which have a lower prf in order to achieve longer range . mtd also requires greater processing power . this is a limiting factor for many older technology radars , and restricts the most sophisticated doppler filtering techniques to the latest solid-state radars . clutter maps point clutter such as buildings , towers , chimneys and radio masts , and much ground clutter , is predictable and unchanging . rather than requiring the radar to analyse and detect this clutter and process it on every antenna sweep , using up processor power , the clutter characteristics can be stored in a memory circuit , which is then accessed on each sweep to remove that clutter from the signal . this is known as a clutter map . some radars have numerical limits on the number of range-azimuth cells which can be used for clutter mapping or rag techniques . the total number of cells available may not be sufficient to accommodate processing of all clutter sources visible to the radar , especially where extensive wind farms are involved . automatic tracking further processing can include automatic detection of aircraft tracks . this is based on analysis of successive returns from a target to determine the

- 30 direction and speed of its movement . automatic tracking radars will display only targets meeting the specified track criteria so , for example , returns which do not match the speed characteristics of an aircraft will not be displayed . this process is also known as plot extraction . the screen display has no 'raw ' radar returns but shows confirmed tracks as a line indicating the direction of the movement , the length of the line indicating the speed of the aircraft . plot extraction can be further developed so that the track of an aircraft can be projected through an area of poor coverage by 'coasting ' . this involves the track processor predicting where the next plot from the aircraft will be , given its track history in terms of speed and direction . coasting can therefore allow tracking to continue over areas where the radar may not actually be illuminating the aircraft . tracking processors can also suppress track initiation in selected areas . this will reject any track which first appears in a selected area ( such as a range-azimuth cell containing a wind turbine ) but will retain pre-existing tracks which have entered that cell from elsewhere . acceptability of this type of processing will depend on the probability of an aircraft first appearing on radar in that cell and the probability that it will generate a track on moving into adjacent cells . probabilities will be dependent on the physical dimensions of the range-azimuth cell . the smaller the cell , the smaller the impact on radar coverage area , and also the less time aircraft will spend in each suppressed cell . as a guide , a typical faaspecification airport surveillance radar has range-azimuth cells measuring 0.75° in azimuth ( 242m wide at 10nm range from the radar ) by 1/16nm ( 115m ) in range . acceptability of track initiation suppression will also depend on the traffic mix . if slow moving , non-transponding traffic such as helicopters or light aircraft are likely to fly in the area , regulators may regard track initiation suppression as unacceptable . antenna elevation evidence from belfast suggests that wind turbine clutter may be avoided by raising the antenna beam elevation angle . air traffic service providers may be less willing to contemplate such a measure for a man-made development than they would for unavoidable causes of clutter , such as terrain , but experience with proposed measures to mitigate the effects of the windy standard wind farm on the lowther hill radar suggests that this may be a feasible technique . it is likely to be more applicable in the case of en route radars than for aerodrome surveillance radars since coverage at lower levels is more important for the latter . mitigation policy and practice there appear to be inconsistencies in the application of radar safeguarding policy with respect to wind turbines in the uk . caa srg officials have stated that the processing out of wind turbine returns on radar , whether by eliminating all returns from particular regions ( through such techniques as range-azimuth gating ) or by use of multiple doppler filters to screen out

- 31 targets meeting specified velocity criteria , is unacceptable since there can be no guarantee that these processes will not also eliminate genuine targets such as slow-moving helicopters or light aircraft . however , in practice , a variety of radar processing techniques are already applied in radars in the uk to eliminate weather clutter and road traffic in particular . these techniques are likely to involve some degradation of the radar 's capability to detect targets moving at similar velocities - again , typically , slow-moving helicopters and light aircraft . in some controlled air traffic environments , this degradation of primary radar performance will be of little or no concern because helicopters will be using transponders and nontransponder-equipped light aircraft are not permitted in the airspace . however in uncontrolled airspace , or categories of controlled airspace where non-transponding vfr traffic is permitted , these processing techniques will already be reducing radar performance against some traffic . processing techniques such as plot extraction are also widely used in nats radars . at aberdeen airport , for example , approach radar services are provided using data from the nearby dual-function ( en route/aerodrome ) perwinnes hill radar head . plot extraction is performed at the radar site and the processed data fed to aberdeen airport by modem . this processing eliminates any targets which do not move by a defined amount within a specified time period . this would include , for example , a hovering or slowmoving helicopter . the acceptability of this type of processing at aberdeen is notable given the high volume of helicopter traffic there . further , nats has given approval for suppression of wind turbine returns in at least one case involving a large wind farm proposal in an important area for commercial air traffic near a civil airport . some mismatch between responses to wind farm development proposals and existing operational experience is also evident in the ministry of defence . the operational significance of particular wind turbine impacts on radars at raf airfields in the uk is assessed by staff at hq raf strike command operational support ( atc ) . each case is considered on its merits , taking account of proximity to runways , flight paths and instrument patterns . cumulative impact of several wind farms within line of sight of a radar are a growing concern . however , although the raf safeguarding policy document , ap100g-03 , sets out limits for the total angular extent of any obstructions for secondary surveillance radars,17 no such criteria are applied in the case of primary radar . assessment of operational significance is based on professional judgement taking into account the specific circumstances of each case . experience at raf st mawgan and other military airfields indicates that professional judgement of air traffic control safety specialists may permit multiple wind turbines in several sectors .

- 32 technical feasibility a large proportion of the atc radar infrastructure at uk civil airports comprises marconi 511 and plessey watchman primary radars . both equipments are now supported by alenia marconi systems , and impending reorganisation is likely to mean that the formerly physically separate engineering support teams for the two radars will be merged in one location . this should simplify the investigation of both hardware and software solutions which might be applied as an upgrade to existing radars . 8.2 procedural mitigation while it is clear that many air traffic controllers are happy to continue providing a radar service over and in the vicinity of clutter from wind turbines without limiting the service , procedural measures can be applied . the two principal procedures are those currently in use at prestwick airport - vectoring traffic around the clutter , with the aim of maintaining 5nm separation from the clutter , or limiting the radar service if traffic is vectored over or within 5nm of the clutter . these procedures are applicable to wind turbines located in uncontrolled airspace . for turbines located in or under controlled airspace , mitigation should not be necessary since unidentified returns can be disregarded . prestwick airport has suggested that wind farm clutter within controlled airspace may prevent controllers maintaining standard 3nm separation between aircraft , leading to controllers having to vector traffic around any such clutter , but support for this view has not been found from operational experience elsewhere in the uk .

- 33 9. approaches to consultation and mitigation the impending devolution of safeguarding decision-making from the caa to individual airfields will compound the lack of a clear national basis for decisions on the likely impacts of proposed wind turbines on radar . the senior atco at prestwick airport has suggested that airfields should produce their own safeguarding maps which would indicate the most important areas for clear radar performance as a guide to wind turbine developers . while this approach has much merit , it would need to be underpinned by agreed national standards on how to draw up such maps . without this , wind turbine development would be at the mercy of varying policies across the country . in the absence of a sufficiently sophisticated engineering model which can predict the impact of a specific turbine on a specific radar , national policy must be based on current practical experience . the alternative is to base policy on the theoretical possibility of negative effects , as seems to be the case centrally in the mod , though not at operational level in the armed forces . a policy of objecting to any wind turbine development which might create a radar return would result in continued inability to meet renewable energy targets since large areas of the country would effectively be sterilised for wind energy development . there is scope for bringing together controllers and engineers with practical experience of the radar-wind turbine issue , and regulators and policy-makers , to explore the ways in which air traffic controllers currently cope with visible wind turbines , and to identify transferable lessons in those cases where wind turbines are not regarded as creating serious problems .

- 34 10. conclusions and recommendations

there are clear examples in the uk of co-existence of wind turbines and air traffic control radars . these examples exist at a range of civil and military airfields and en route radar stations . they include several cases where the wind turbines have been in operation for several years without any requirement for intervention by the regulatory/approval authority . the wind power industry should draw these examples to the attention of the key decision-makers in the air traffic control and airfield regulatory/approval authorities and establish a detailed dialogue with those authorities to identify the key determinants of acceptable radar/wind farm co-existence and the operational limits of that co-existence . this may be done under the auspices of the existing working group or separately . case studies from denmark , the netherlands and the usa indicate that technical solutions have been applied which enable radars to process out wind turbine returns while retaining genuine aircraft tracks . while these technologies are particularly available in the most modern solid-state radar designs , there appears to be some scope for retrofitting of advanced processing software to older radars , such as those which make up the bulk of the uk air traffic control infrastructure . the wind industry should consider supporting a feasibility study by the one radar manufacturer now responsible for these older radars , to assess the scope for radar upgrading to process out wind turbine returns . the caa has indicated that radar track processing of the type employed in dutch and danish atc radars is not acceptable in the uk . the wind industry should engage the caa in a dialogue about the reasons for the uk 's different policy on this issue , with a view to changing it . the backing of radar manufacturers may be useful in supporting this move . the caa has also stated that it does not favour the range-azimuth gating ( rag ) approach to eliminating wind turbine returns , which also eliminates aircraft returns from those portions of the radar 's cover . however nats , the main atc radar operator in the uk , appears to take a different view , even in relation to very large wind farms near busy civil airports . the contradiction between these positions needs to be discussed with the caa and nats and a consistent policy developed in consultation with the wind industry .

“ wind turbine syndrome ” f.a.q ’ s
1. what is “ wind turbine syndrome ? ” wind turbine syndrome ( “ wts ” ) is an alleged condition proposed by pediatrician dr nina pierpoint1 . she cites a range of physical sensations ( tinnitus , headache etc . ) and effects ( sleeplessness , anxiety etc . ) based on a series of interviews comprising of a study group of 10 self -selected families . this is a self published report , and dr pierpoint is a known anti-wind campaigner in north america . perhaps more importantly none of her research has been published in a single peer reviewed medical journal . the issue under debate is another example of bad science , which is not only misleading but damaging and disruptive . 2. is this research scientifically credible ? no . although the case series methodology is a recognized research technique the methods used in this study are fundamentally flawed . the are numerous examples of problems with the research , all of which cast serious doubt on its quality • the evidence presented is based on only 10 families . such a small sample can not be regarded as statistically reliable . the nhs news website stated that “ the study design was weak , the study was small and there was no comparison group2 . ” • the nhs website also states “ there is also no information on how the group was selected in the first place and some uncertainty as to which countries these people come from . ” • there is no clinical baseline for the study and no case control group to validate the research , both of which are standard practice in any responsible research of this nature . • the research has not been published in any peer reviewed academic or medical journal . • the evidence makes the very simple mistake of concluding that a “ correlation proves causation ” . this is wrong . • the attempt to imply the industry will discount the health problems as merely “ imaginary or psychosomatic ” are not substantiated and ignore decades of scientific evidence on noise and vibration .

3. can wind turbines produce ‘ harmful low frequency noise ’ no . academics who specialize in low frequency sound have discounted pierpoint ’ s claims , not least because they ignore decades of established medical research . although the book uses manchester university ’ s recent research3 into the workings of the human ear to justify its conclusion , the author of that research , dr neil todd , has stated : “ our work does not provide the direct evidence suggested…i do not believe that there is any direct evidence to show that any of the above acoustico-physiological mechanisms are activated by the radiations from wind turbines . ” research by g leventhall4 in the peer-reviewed journal canadian acoustics examined whether or not wind turbines produce infrasound at levels that can impact humans . specifically it refuted the allegations about infrasound , which the research concluded was “ irrelevant and possibly harmful , should they lead to unnecessary fears5 ” . 4. are wind farms noisy ? in 2007 , as part of research into wind farm noise commissioned by the government , the university of salford surveyed all local authorities in the uk where wind farms were in operation . out of all uk wind farms ( 133 at the time of the report operating for up to 16 years ) , only one wind farm has ever been found guilty of causing a nuisance to the nearest residents – and the issue has since been resolved through management of the turbine control system . in comparison , the report highlights that in one year alone ( and for only 69 % of local authorities in england and wales , not the entirety of the uk ) , there were 39,508 cases of noise nuisance not related to wind farm noise . ”

5. so why are wind turbines now being built offshore ? the move to building offshore is not based on health grounds . it is a logical next step in maximising wind yields and follows developments in wind technology and deployment . there is a tremendous wind energy resource offshore , and this is the next frontier in wind energy development . 6. are wind turbines safe ? yes . wind power perhaps represents the most benign of all available options for electrical generation . the world health organisation6 was quite categorical in its analysis that wind power represents one of the most benign of all forms of electrical generation ( alongside some other renewable technologies ) in terms of direct and indirect health effects . there is no safer or healthier alternative . despite over 100,000 turbines now installed globally there remains no peer reviewed evidence of any health concerns with wind turbines .

e n v i r o n m e n ta l i m p o r ta n c e
during summer 2002 , elsam erected the world 's largest offshore windfarm at horns rev in the north sea - an offshore wind power plant . the farm comprises 80 wind turbines erected under real offshore conditions 14 to 20 kilometers out in the north sea . the wind farm at horns rev is a considerable contribution to the international objective to reduce co2 emission and will cover almost two per cent of the total danish power consumption .

environmental gains
until recently wind power was confined to be land-based , but increasing problems to obtain permissions to erect wind turbines and the technological development of the wind turbines have made it possible to establish offshore wind farms on competitive conditions . by placing the wind turbine offshore , where the wind blows freely , a production from each wind turbine is obtained which is approx 50 per cent higher than it would have been if the wind turbine was placed on land .

focus on wildlife
before , during and after the erection of the offshore wind farm , comprehensive environmental studies have been carried through shedding a light on wildlife and vegetation . the results form part of the basis for further expansion with wind turbines in the years to come - in denmark as well as abroad .

commissioned 2002
the wind farm was established during summer 2002. because of the harsh weather conditions in the north sea , the erection of totally 80 wind turbines was carried out with a number of different specially built vessels . the work had been thoroughly planned from the outset and was carried through in well-defined phases : 1. the foundations , which are monopiles - i.e . steel pipes - with a diameter of approx 4 meters , were rammed approx 25 meters into the seabed . after ramming down , each foundation was terminated with a transition piece on which the working platform , the landing stage and the cable protections had already been mounted . 2. wind turbine erection was made by specially built jack-up vessels which can stand firm on the seabed by means of submersible supporting legs . the vessels carried two complete wind turbines at a time and could lift the wind turbines into position on the foundations with cranes on the vessels . 3. having been erected , each wind turbine was electrically connected to the transformer substation through submarine cables . the wind farm production is collected at an offshore transformer substation and is transmitted through a buried submarine cable to the onshore power transmission grid . by the end of 2002 , all wind turbines had been commissioned and non-polluting power could be transmitted into the power grid . the wind farm being situated far out at sea has made it necessary to develop new concepts for wind turbine maintenance , including the possibility that service personnel can be landed on the wind turbines from a helicopter . the wind turbines are buoyed for the sake of marine and air traffic .

operation and surveillance
as a result of the exceptionally advanced surveillance and control , the offshore wind farm is practically to be considered as a medium-sized power plant capable of controlling production in case of , for example , restrictions in the power grid . remote surveillance is made from the elsam onshore control plant .

what you need to know about wind turbines what you need to know about wind turbines and the green energy act the green energy act , 2009 is a provincial legislation intended to “ foster growth of renewable energy projects which use cleaner sources of energy , and to removing barriers to and promoting opportunities for renewable energy projects and to promoting a green economy . ” -preamble , green energy act , r.s.o . c. 12 the key phrases being : “ removing barriers ” – what barriers ? and , “ promoting opportunities ” – for whom and at what cost ? the green energy act , 2009 is a short piece of legislation consisting of twenty clauses but amends a further eleven other acts , including : electricity act , 1998 ; ministry of energy act ; ontario energy board act , 1998 ; clean water act , 2006 ; environmental bill of rights ; environmental protection act ; ontario water resources act ; co-operative corporations act ; building code act , 1992 ; planning act ; and , ministry of natural resources legislations like the green energy act , 2009 are to a greater or lesser extent , enabling acts to permit a ministry , in this case numerous ministries , to pass regulations which clarify what the enabling legislation actually means in terms the actual governmental powers being created and applied . for example , the recently passed ontario regulation 359/09 made under the environmental protection act changes the approval process for renewable energy projects . the regulation , amongst other things sets out minimum separation distances of the turbine from “ noise receptors ” ( meaning homes , churches , schools , etc ) by and large based a the computer-modeled noise capacity of the wind turbine . ontario regulation 359/09 determines the set-backs from houses based on the “ noise guidelines for wind farms ” dated october , 2008 – the wind turbine facility may “ not exceed the lowest hourly ambient sound level ” being 40dba at the noise receptor . this is notable , given the fact that the ministry of environment stated on september 30 , 2009 that “ there is currently no scientifically accepted field methodology to measure wind turbine noise to determine compliance or to determine non-compliance with certificate of approval limits ” . the green energy act , 2009 also made direct changes to various legislations that effect citizens ’ daily lives , to a greater and lesser extent . one important legislation amended by the green energy act that affects the taxpayers of a municipality directly and measurably is the planning act , r.s.o . 1990 c.p.13 . wind turbine facilities in ontario are typically placed in areas zoned agricultural which ordinarily requires an application to change the zoning to permit a non-agricultural industrial use in the agriculturally zoned area . such an application would ordinarily be refused , as most , if not all , official plans and zoning bylaws in ontario prohibit industrial uses in agricultural areas that are not agriculturally related , for what should be , obvious reasons : the preservation of our agricultural lands . “ the preservation of agricultural lands ” as well as other social and economic priorities such as long term economic prosperity , natural heritage ; cultural heritage and archeology , and protecting public health and safety ( amongst numerous other generally agreed upon social and economic values and priorities ) are set out in a document called the provincial policy statement , ( 2005 ) whose purpose is to guide planning decisions by obliging electing officials to weigh all of the relevant values and priorities involved in the decision . wind turbine facilities not being consistent with many of those priorities mentioned above are therefore “ barriers ” for renewable energy projects , specifically , wind turbines . wind turbines however , are consistent with one of the priorities set out in the recently amended provincial policy statement , ( 2005 ) under “ energy and air quality ” . to permit wind turbine facilities in chatham-kent , the most heavily populated agricultural area in canada , having 90 % of the class 1 farmland in canada , it was necessary for your council to ignore all other competing priorities , other than energy and air quality to justify granting approvals for wind turbine facilities . it was further necessary to ignore the peer review scientific studies showing the negative health consequences of placing wind turbines any closer than 1-2 kilometers from someone ’ s home . it was also necessary for council to ignore the overwhelming evidence from england , australia and the united states of the profoundly negative effect the proximity wind turbines will have on proper values in their vicinity . our municipal council , much to their collective relief has now had any authority to plan our community as it concerns the placing of this industrial use in our agricultural lands taken from them by the green energy act , 2009 . the green energy act , 2009 has simply stated that the official plan for chatham-kent and the provincial policy statement , ( 2005 ) no longer apply to renewable energy facilities , except , of course , for the niagara escarpment plan ; chatham-kent landscapes , mainly the vista between clearville and morpeth looking out over lake erie , are “ not being considered unique ” either within southern ontario or chatham-kent according to the environmental screening reports required in support of wind turbine facility applications in proximity to lake erie and lake st. clair . “ the area has no designated or recognized viewscapes ” , except of course , to the residents and the thousands of tourists who use number 3 highway as their access to chatham-kent , precisely because of the viewscape between clearville and morpeth . for the citizens of chatham-kent , the green energy act , 2009 simply institutionalizes the ignorance , arrogance , incompetence and lack of vision of the council and mayor of the municipality of chatham-kent . your provincial government could care less about the economic and health impacts on the citizens of chatham-kent given our small population and minimal voting power and are more concerned with appearing to address global warming without actually doing anything . now , our m.p.p . is pat hoy and a member of the governing liberal party . mr. hoy supported the position of property owners of the north shore of lake erie in essex county at pigeon bay in opposing the placement of wind turbines off their shores in lake erie – the proposal would no doubt have devastated those lakeshore owners ’ property values . mr. hoys ’ opposition was because “ pigeon bay is in the direct path of a very significant bird and butterfly migration and a flight path to the renowned jack miner bird sanctuary and point pelee national park . mr. hoy should then be interested to know that the waterfowl migration focal point of both the atlantic flyway and the mississippi flyway is in the municipality of chatham-kent . the major staging ground for waterfowl migrating north and south is lake st. clair and that area of the north shore of lake erie between clearville and rondeau bay , which passes over two provincial parks – rondeau and the new , to be announced provincial park at clear creek near clearville and lake erie . the north shore of lake erie is also the primary migration route for monarch butterflies , hawks , eagles and the spring warbler migration - a world class birding phenomenon . mr. hoy maintains however , that “ i support all wind projects on land in my riding thus far ” . health concerns and property values on our lake shores apparently do not concern your current member of the provincial parliament . stay tuned for our next flyer where we will inquire into who exactly benefits from wind turbines “ opportunities ” – i ’ ll give you a hint – it isn ’ t you . douglas desmond , barrister & solicitor 27 main street east , ridgetown , on n0p 2c0 write your mayor , your council member and your member of provincial parliament : mayor : randy hope m.p.p . : pat hoy ( kent-essex ) office of the mayor constituency office municipality of chatham-kent 111 heritage road , suite 100 315 king street west , p.o . box 640 chatham , ontario n7m 5w7 chatham , ontario , n7m 5k8 phone : 519-351-0510 phone : 519-436-3219 fax : 519-436-3236 councilor : jim brown ( east kent ) councilor : steve pinsonneault ( east kent ) 48 ebenezer street west 93 lemuel street ridgetown , ontario n0p 2c0 p.o . box 32 phone : 519-436-3252 thamesville , ontario n0p 2k0 phone : 519-436-3253 for further information , contact : wind concerns ontario chatham-kent wind action group www.windconcernsontario.wordpress.com/ www.ckwag.org email : windconcerns @ gmail.com

abstract : brazil presents favorable conditions for the use of wind energy , increasing even more the current power production with renewable energy sources . currently , the installed capacity is approximately 700mw , even though it has a potential of about 150gw , and in order to step further in the more dynamic way into the usage of this energy , it is necessary that the country present specific politics for the scientific and technological development of wind energy in brazil , allowing technological resource exchange and creating mechanisms for professional development . the present paper describes activities and the results obtained to testing small . wind turbines in laboratory including methodology for evaluation of static bending test and cyclic loads for small wind turbines using as references standards and procedures .

1. performance of wind turbines on wind tunnel the international standard iec 61400-12-1 [ 1 ] has the methodologies for power curve test of wind turbines ( fig . 1 ) . the annex h of this standard has the procedures for small wind turbines , and the present paper uses this information as reference , however adapted to measure the power curve on a wind tunnel . other references [ 2 , 3 ] present procedures and results of small wind turbines .

2. methodologies developed in laboratory

2.1 small wind turbine power performance the wind tunnel procedure presented in this paper does n't have the intent of replacing the field tests to measure the power curve of wind turbines , as specified in the iec 61400-12-1. it 's a complement method that can be used as an aid to help preliminary tests in machines still under development and verify its performance . the system is formed by the wind turbine , battery bank , resistive load bank , load controller and a wind tunnel with open flow . the wind speed is measured with a cup anemometer located between the aero generator and the end of the wind tunnel ( fig . 2 ) . a preliminary procedure is necessary to obtain the relation of the speed read by the anemometer and the speed at the turbine plane . later , this relation is used to correct the power curve .

fig . 2 wind turbine testing procedure in wind tunel the system assembled at the laboratory ( fig.3 ) uses a battery bank with capacity for 300ah , an rms power transductor of 5kw with accuracy of 0.2 % of reading , wind tunnel controlled by a frequency inverter of 74kw , resistive load bank with maximum power of 3kw , calibrated anemometer and other meteorological sensors . the load controller was set to the diversion control mode , in which a resistive bank is used to redirect the excess power instead of letting it go to the battery . the operation range of this controller was set to 10 % of the test voltage .

the variations of wind speed on the wind tunnel is automated , allowing to test the turbines in a reduced time , the procedure of measuring the power curve lasts less than three hours . to achieve that , a micro controlled system is connected to the frequency inverter that turns the wind tunnel 's fan on and controls the increase and decrease of the wind speed at the turbine automatically .

2.2 small vertical axis wind turbine performance . besides the power test generators with small horizontal axis wind turbines whose methodology has been presented in previous [ 3 ] . currently are developments an methodology for the mechanical torque rotor vertical axis wind turbines with the primary purpose of raising the coefficient of power and torque coefficient of this rotors . in the test , the permanent magnet generator is used as an electromagnetic brake in order to produce a torque on the rotor axis wind . this allows a current control in the permanent magnet generator which in turn will control the torque to be applied in the wind rotor . this control is carried out a preliminary test for the maximum torque of the rotor to determine the maximum brake rotor . these parameters are needed for the control of the braking doing a more thorough analysis covering the full range of rotation and torque of the rotor . this procedure uses beyond the majority of sensors already specified for the power curve , and also , a torque wrench to measure the dynamic torque of the rotor wind . with the torque characteristic curve obtained is possible to determine the coefficient of mechanical rotor power ( cp ) , as essential to determine the best generator to be mounted on the rotor for the construction of a wind turbine with a satisfactory return . in previous tests , tests were made with various geometries [ 3 ] , obtained with a wind tunnel under the current these limitations are the range of speeds and test section . the results found previously are important since they show the first results of performance rotors wind with new geometry tested in the laboratory . for new tests with the rotors in the laboratory was needed to build a new structure to support the wind turbine , including a mechanical system with the generator , a torque wrench , flexible couplings and optical sensor for measuring revolutions per minute . a typical testing of prototypes is shown in fig . 4 .

3. procedures for cyclical test wind turbine blades a wind turbine is subjected during lifetime to a large number of dynamic loads produced by the rotation of the blades as well as the turbulent nature of wind on the blades . fig.7 shows schematically the coordinate system of the blades of a turbine and the load caused by the forces of wind and a detail of a blade to analyze load test bench .

fig . 7 bending load representation in blade wind turbine the main objective in cyclic tests is to evaluate the test bench efforts to determine the fatigue life of blades . fatigue is a phenomenon that causes a gradual reduction in operating capacity of the material when subjected to repeated loading . in the case of the blades of wind turbines it is a cyclic loading . the fatigue comes from the action of stresses that vary in less time not exceeding the elastic limit of the material . these loadings cause cracks and rupture of the material . there are several methods used to study and predict the fatigue of materials , and the so-called wohler method has been used to study wind turbine blades . this method studies the behavior of fatigue by s-n curves , which relates the history of elastic tension acting on the structure with the number of cycles that the material support before failing . to quantify the damage caused to the material by cyclic loading of different amplitudes and different average values are used to accumulation rule called linear palmgren-miner . in agree with this rule the damage suffered by that part under the action of each amplitude of the cyclical stress is directly proportional to the number of cycles loads that actuation on the amplitude stress .

3.1 developing cyclic load bench test the present section describes the methodological aspects as the project is in run-up in test bench for testing the fatigue and static testing to determine preliminary magnitude of forces . they can be used to wind turbine blades with a length up to 2.7 m. in the near future is expected to continue with new publications show results of the bench in development . the test bench will have a load cell located in the connecting rod between the ruler and the blade to read their charges at the point of force application . the main reference used is the work of epaarachchi [ 4 ] . the blade is instrumented along its length at locations pre-defined with strain gauges with a view to measure the deformation . the test will apply a cyclic load on the blades for a wide range of frequencies and displacement . tensions received by the blades of wind turbines are caused by aerodynamic forces and inertial forces . this work is expected to reproduce the same effort by shifts through a point of application of forces in the bench test show in fig . 8. this device induces the structure of the blade bending loads only , however the

actual functioning originates efforts both bending and axial stresses . the system requires an input of data adjusting the offsets and frequencies in the device test . a data acquisition system is used presenting two main parts : strain gauges placed along the blade in preselected locations and data logger for collecting and processing data .

fig . 8 fatigue bench test to small wind turbine blades in the work of epaarachchi [ 4 ] the load levels based on the most critical point of the blade are predetermined and later used in the tests with the aid of the loads determined by means of finite elements ( fea ) . this work will be assessed on the best methodology that can be adopted to determine the fatigue test conditions . 3.2 preliminary results of static bending test
this section presents the tests of the three-point bending machine to analyze the mechanical behavior of the blades when subjected to mechanical stress . the test consists of applying a load in the center of the sample of the blade ( proof body ) supported at two points according to standard astm e 855-90 [ 5 ] . the applied load came from an initial and slowly increased until failure of the proof body . the value of the applied load versus the displacement of the central point was the response of the test . was used at a speed of 0.02 mm/s for the application of the load , and tested two specimens under identical conditions . the distance between supports was 142 mm and was given a preload of 150 n before doing the test . fig.9 show an example of the test result where you can observe the application of the preload , the region of elastic behavior , the region of plastic behavior and the subsequent fracture . the average value for the force was 1500 n and the strength of the early fracture of 1650 n. the samples had a mean total displacement of 11 mm .

introduction ari hybrid solar-wind generator system optimizes the use of natural energy resources and combines the newest technology . the optimal stand-alone power system many remote towns or sparsely populated areas are not serviced by the main power grid . power has to be generated locally using engine generators powered by conventional fuels , such as diesel . however the transport and storage of diesel fuel can be expensive and the supply is not always reliable . therefore , diesel generators are best used on a short-term basis or for emergency purpose . solar and wind energies are good alternatives to provide more consistent year-round energy production . solar and wind energies are also the most available renewable energy resources on earth , and many remote areas have plenty supply of both . the sun is the source of all energy on earth . wind is a form of solar energy and is caused by the uneven heating of the earth ’ s surface by the sun . for example , the poles receive less energy from the sun than the equator does , and the dry land heats up and cools down more quickly than the seas do . in much of the earth , wind speeds are low in the summer when the sun shines brightest and longest . the wind is strong in the winter when less sunlight is available . wind speeds are also low during the day when sunlight is strong , but increase after dark when the earth surface is cooler . because the peak for wind flow and sunlight occur at different times of the day and year , wind energy and solar energy can complement each other . a hybrid solar-wind power system can balance out the ever fluctuating solar and wind resources , and is more likely to produce power when you need it . the best combination of technology solar power systems use solar panels to convert light energy into electrical energy . solar regulators , which are also known as solar charge controllers , regulate the solar panel 's charging current before it is stored in banks of specially designed batteries . power inverters are then used to convert direct current ( dc ) electricity produced by the solar panel cell to alternating current ( ac ) . the advantages of solar system are their reliability and low operating costs . but they are relatively expensive to manufacture . wind power is the conversion of wind energy into electricity using wind turbines , which turn in the moving air and power an electric generator that supplies an electric current . similar to solar power systems , charge controllers are used to regulate the charging current and before it is stored in battery banks , and inverters then are used to convert dc to ac . the advantages of wind power systems are their low production and operating costs , but the disadvantage is their low reliability . solar and wind power systems both suffer from variation in the weather , resulting in inconsistent power supply . batteries are needed for non-charging periods in order to stabilize supply . however , daily electricity output could fluctuate greatly due to variations in weather . the fluctuation could lead batteries under-charged for a long period of time , causing the battery life to shorten . since solar power and wind power can complement each other as energy source , a hybrid solar-wind power system will optimize the use of these two natural energy resources for off-grid power supply . manufacturing costs of hybrid systems can be reduced because the same battery banks and inverters can be used for both the solar and the wind components . however , one obstacle still remains for wide spread use of hybrid wind-solar power systems : the reliability of small wind generator . at ari , we consider the reliability criteria for wind generator as follows : the speed of wind varies from moment to moment so it is not reliable to rate electricity output based on the wind speed of a particular moment . the average wind speed varies little from year to year for a given area . this allows us to calculate annual electricity generation with reasonable accuracy . based on the formula , e=0.2d2v3 , energy varies with the third power of the wind speed . during the year , wind speed varies between 3m/s and 8m/s . electricity output should be measured based on the low end of the wind speed instead of the peak speed . wind generators often have to work in extreme weather conditions such as sand storm , rain storm , turbulent wind climate , and in high salt alkaloid environment . to ensure reliability , the turbine must undergo rigorous test , potentially increasing costs . systems which are less costly are usually under-tested , and therefore , less reliable . advanced over-speed protection system as the technology of small wind generator has advanced in past decades , so has the industry . however , the reliability of small wind generator continues to plague this industry . due to cost considerations , manufacturers tend to use mechanical controllers , which are based on simple principles of aerodynamics , for wind power control , in lieu of the more technologically advanced and more expensive hydraulic pressure controller . while it could pass wind tunnel tests , mechanical controller , which has movable parts , does not work well in the field due to the complexity and rapidity of change in wind speed and wind direction . often in extreme weather conditions , the movable mechanical parts invariably wear out , resulting in the break-down of the system . since the fewer the movable parts , the less the chances for a breakdown , high quality wind generators today typically have only three movable parts : main body of wind turbine rotor blades over-speed protection system the first two movable parts are indispensable because they make up the core of a wind turbine . they also do not wear out as easily as the controller . in order to increase reliability , we must turn our attention to the over-speed protection system . all wind turbines are designed with some kind of over-speed protection system . in case of strong wind it is necessary to waste part of the excess energy of the wind in order to avoid damaging the wind turbine . there are two different ways of designing an over-speed protection system on modern wind turbines . pitch controlled wind turbine that turns blades out of the wind when the wind output becomes too high , and turns them back into the wind when the wind drops . stall controlled wind turbines that have rotor blades bolted onto the hub at a fixed angle . when the wind speed becomes too high , it creates turbulence on the side of the rotor blade which is not facing the wind . this stall prevents the lifting force of the rotor blade from acting on the rotor . however , both approaches have technical problems . wind flow is a complex phenomenon . not only is turbulence a constant occurrence , but also the change of wind speed and direction is instantaneous and frequent . no mechanical apparatus can react swiftly enough to the instant change in wind flow . as a result , the heavy wear and tear often causes the breakdown of the wind turbine . ari renewable energy co. has developed a brand new electromagnetic brake for ari hybrid solar-wind generator . the new technology incorporates an entirely new magnetoelectricity regulator that functions as a brake . this brand-new regulating protection idea has discarded the mechanical regulation structure and has fundamentally solved reliable operational problem associated with the hybrid solar-wind generator . this brand-new regulating control idea has following advantages : it has discarded the mechanical regulating structure and the wind turbine therefore only retains two movement parts . as a result , it greatly enhances the structural stability and reliability of the ari wind turbine . the design of the main body of the wind turbine now has more artistic and diverse choices when the mechanical regulating structure is limited . the advanced over-speed protection system also gives different levels of charge control according to the wind speed scope , which greatly increases the reliability of the ari hybrid solar-wind power system . i . safety precautions ari solar-wind generator is designed under strict safety regulations . however , any electrical and/or mechanical equipment , during installation or operation , can cause potential inherent dangers without safety precautions . please read thoroughly the following ari solar-wind power generator safety precautions before installation of your solar-wind generator . 1.1 i nstallation s afety rotating blades can move fast enough that the tip of a blade is almost invisible and can cause serious injury when a person comes near the moving rotor blades . please do not install the turbine where anyone can come in contact with the blades . please do not install the blades until the turbine is mounted on the tower . undersized wire or bad connection can cause over-current electrical dangers and overheat in wiring systems , that could cause fire or inherent personal dangers . please follow the instruction on the wire-sizing chart in this manual strictly . please fuse all connections and choose the correct size of fuse or circuit breaker according to the guidelines of this manual . it is very important to disconnect all turbine wiring from batteries , turn the controller switch off before installation . please carefully follow the step by step installation procedures . connecting the wires to the battery prior to the installation of the turbine can cause the rotor to spin-up during installation and result in personal injury . please do not attach the wires to the batteries throughout the installation process . during tower setup , under no circumstance should any human being stand near the construction site . it is important for you to consult with a local specialized tower installation technician . and you will need someone available to help during the installation process . the turbine installation should take place on the ground level prior mounting the turbine to the tower . please do not allow any unassociated person or crowd stand near the construction site during the installation process . 1 . 2 operation safety fasten all tower welding , bolts , nuts and tighten all connections before operation . before regular maintenance or battery replacement , please shut down the turbine by setting the controller switch to “ stop ” position . please do not disconnect the battery wires when the controller is set to “ on ” position . the moving rotor blades can be broken if a solid object comes in contact with them . after setting the controller switch to “ stop ” position , you should wait until the blades stop from rotating before any maintenance or inspection of the blades . ari wind turbine is designed to shut down automatically when a strong wind blows through the site . however , before extreme weather approaches your area , such as but not limited to hurricane , tornado , and extreme winds ( 110 mph+ ; 60 m/s ) , you should lower down the tower to protect any potential accidence . before lowering down the tower , you must set the controller switch to “ stop ” position , disconnect the wires led to battery , and make sure the blades stop from rotating . 2 . parts in the package please unpack and check the packing list to make sure every part is included in the packing box . no . part name quantity 1 alternator main body 1 2 rotor

feasibility of a unique wind feasibility of a unique wind powered home heating system by : mark f. czajkowski prof. kenneth d. visser the objective of this thesis is to determine if wind turbines are an economically sound method , of providing energy , for space heating and water heating in a home , and if a small scale contra rotating vertical axis wind turbine ( cr-vawt ) is feasible . on average a household in the northeastern portion of the u.s. spends $ 2,246 annually to heat their home . this calculation is based on a 2,500 ft2 home that uses natural gas . the cost is the summation of the cost of fuel , equipment , and the social cost of pollution . the cost of fuel is $ 1062.40 per year1,2 . the equipment cost is calculated using a present value annuity for 30 years and 7 % . therefore , a $ 4,0004,5 furnace costs the homeowner $ 322.35 per year . pollution from furnaces presents a cost to society in the form of health effects and global warming . according to pearce ( 2003 ) , $ 143.24 is spent on the effects of one ton of carbon dioxide . as a result , the carbon dioxide from the average northeastern home costs society $ 860.80 per year7 . for a wind turbine powered heating system to be economical , the cost would have to be less than $ 2,246 annually . to determine if this is feasible the total cost is calculated using present value annuity for 30 years at 7 % . the cost of the turbine powered heating system will have to be less than $ 27,870 . the size of the turbine is needed in order estimate the cost of the heating system . it was determined that a 4 kw turbine would be sufficient to supply the heat for an average home . a 7.5 kw wind turbine from bergey windpower co. is listed at $ 21,900 , below the $ 27,870 to be economical . the bergey excel , 7.5 kw turbine and the wisper 500 , 3.2 kw turbine are priced below $ 27,870 and it would be economical for a homeowner to install the turbine to heat their home . furthermore , the turbine comes with equipment to connect it to either a battery bank or the electric grid . this equipment is costly and would not be necessary if the turbine was connected to a heating system . the heating system would use an immersion heater , which is an enclosed resister . the resister can accept electricity at any frequency , unlike the power grid that needs 60 hz . vertical axis wind turbines ( vawt ) have been around for many years and have many advantageous that a small homeowner could take advantage of . a vawt is a relatively simple design , does not need to track the wind direction , could perform better in turbulent wind , and the generator can be located near the ground for easier maintenance . a cr-vawt is two vawts on the same tower that spin opposite directions . the cr-vawt is advantageous because the rpm at the generator is higher than a comparable vawt . there is no record of a cr-vawt being researched or on the market ; therefore , this research is to test the feasibility of the concept . a test turbine was designed in solidworks and is shown in figure 1. the turbine has been built , figure 2 , and will be tested in clarkson university ’ s wind tunnel . figure 1 : cr-vawt solidworks model figure 2 : cr-vawt prototype a similar type of turbine has been research at clarkson university over the past three years , the contra rotating horizontal axis wind turbines ( cr-hawt ) . the main issue with the turbines was that both rotors spun the same direction even though their blades were positioned such that they should spin in opposite directions . it was suggested that the forces , that spin the generator , were causing the unanticipated result . rotors with different solidity were tested to try to balance to torques . the turbine did work , but was inconsistent and difficult to keep both rotors from spinning the same direction.8 testing of the cr-vawt will be done to determine if a cr-vawt is feasible , and to gain more knowledge on contra rotating turbines . when designing a test turbine , the problems with the horizontal axis wind turbine was taken into consideration . therefore , if the torque from one turbine is more powerful then the other , the turbine has designed such that the diameter of the outside rotor can be changed , and therefore the torque from the outside rotor can be changed . it is hypothesized that if the torques from both rotors are the same , the turbine will function correctly . reference : energy information administration , 2001 space-heating energy consumption in u.s. households by four most populated states , 2001 , residential energy consumption survey energy information administration , 2001 water-heating energy consumption in u.s. households by four most populated states , 2001 , residential energy consumption survey energy information administration , march , 2007 , u.s. natural gas residential price ( dollars per thousand cubic feet ) , besley , s. , brigham , e.f. , 2006 , principles of finance , third edition , thomson south western energy information administration , 2001 water-heating energy consumption in u.s. households by four most populated states , 2001 , residential energy consumption survey pearce , d. , nov. 2003 , the social cost of carbon and its policy implications , oxford review of economic policy . vol.19 , iss . 3 ;

performance of mains connected small-scale wind turbines
nick stannard
1. abstract small-scale wind turbines have been recognised by the uk government as playing a significant role in the future uk energy mix [ 1 ] . as such , it is important that the necessary turbine and generator systems are well matched in order to maximise power output and energy capture . in this paper a turbulent wind model is combined with models of the turbine , generator and power conversion system to study potential problems that can arise with incorrect turbine design . a small 2.5 kw , “ h ” bladed vertical axis wind turbine is studied to examine the effect different blade profiles may have in turbulent winds . a symmetrical blade section is seen to cause potential stall problems whilst these are avoided by the use of a cambered blade section . 2. introduction figure 1 depicts a 2.5kw vertical axis wind turbine ( vawt ) that may soon become a common sight in the built environment . the turbine employs a 3-phase permanent magnet generator that has been developed at durham particularly for use with such turbines , and is shown in the photo . ( further details of the generator can be found in reference [ 2 ] . ) figure 2 shows how the system is connected electrically : the 3phase ac from the generator is rectified to dc and then inverted back to ac at mains frequency and voltage .

care must be taken to properly integrate the different components of the system in order to produce efficient conversion of wind energy to electricity . for example , the generator must be designed to produce not only rated power at the rated turbine speed , but also to provide the correct voltage throughout the speed range . this point is crucial because the inverter exports power to the grid in proportion to the generator ’ s voltage ( neglecting losses ) . if this voltage is too high , the inverter will try to export too much power and this may cause the turbine to stall . likewise , if the voltage is too low , only a tiny amount of electrical energy will be generated . the blade profile is another critical aspect of the system design which affects the maximum energy capture of the turbine , its optimal rotational speed , its self-starting ability , and its susceptibility to stalling in turbulent wind . it is this last aspect which is of particular interest in this paper and is explored in some depth . it was found that if the designer failed to match the load characteristic – imposed by the inverter – with the turbine characteristic , a sudden gust of wind may force the turbine into the stall zone . it was also found that certain blade profiles were more susceptible to this type of behaviour , namely , symmetrical ones .

3. control of small-scale wind turbines to the casual observer , operating an efficient wind energy conversion system may seem a simple matter of attaching an efficient turbine to an efficient generator and switching the system on . however , the key to producing a reasonable quantity of energy is not in the detail of the individual turbine blades or the generator , but in how the whole system is controlled . wind turbines can only work efficiently in a narrow band of speeds which vary according to the strength of the wind , as shown in figure 3 for wind speeds ranging from 4-13 m/s . thus , the power extracted from the generator must be carefully controlled to maintain the turbine ’ s optimal rotational speed . the optimal turbine speed over the range of wind speeds is shown by the cubic line in figure 3 .

figure 3 : power characteristic of a small-scale wind turbine
in order to export power to the national grid , a sophisticated piece of power electronics – known as a grid-tie inverter – must be used because of the strict regulations that govern the quality of power that can be transmitted . the windboy inverter [ 3 ] is compliant with these regulations and is fast becoming the industry standard for this application . it exports power as a ( roughly ) linear function of turbine speed and so produces an operating line similar to the one shown in figure 3 . ( the inverter allows the gradient of this line to be adjusted to permit the designer some leeway in tailoring the inverter ’ s characteristic to match that of an individual turbine . ) note that the windyboy ’ s power characteristic is linear whereas the turbine ’ s is cubic , meaning that the system only achieves optimal power transfer at one rotational speed . if the turbine is operating at position ( 1 ) , in a steady wind of 9 m/s , and the wind speed abruptly changes to 11m/s , the turbine suddenly produces a quantity of surplus of mechanical power , ∆p . this produces an accelerating torque that shifts the turbine ’ s operating point to position ( 2 ) along the windyboy ’ s operating line . the speed of this transition depends on the turbine ’ s inertia . the same mechanism operates in reverse if the wind speed drops . 4. modelling of small-scale wind energy conversion systems modelling the wind energy conversion system shown in figure 2 requires not only models of the turbine/generator/inverter system but also an accurate model of the wind itself . both of these components have been created in simulink . the turbine/generator/inverter model was verified by comparison with a generator/inverter system on test in the laboratory , while the wind model was validated by comparing predicted wind profiles to real wind data in the time and frequency domains . both models provided an accurate account of their respective real-world systems . a very brief outline of the models is given below ; full details can be found in [ 2 ] and [ 4 ] . 2

the turbine and generator are mechanically connected , which means any imbalance between the turbine torque and the electrical torque from the generator will cause the system to accelerate according to equation ( 1 ) .

where jr is the turbine inertia

dω 1 = ( tmechanical − telectircal ) dt j r

the turbine ’ s mechanical ( or aerodynamic ) torque , for a given wind speed and rotational speed , can be found from a turbine characteristic graph known as a cp-λ curve . the electrical braking torque created by the generator can be calculated by considering how much power the generator is producing at a given rotational speed . this in turn depends on the windyboy ’ s operating characteristic as shown in figure 3. the turbulent wind model was based around a random number generator which produced normally distributed white noise . since the wind speed can not ( for physical reasons ) change instantaneously , the white noise must be smoothed using a carefully designed signal-shaping filter in order to achieve the correct spectral distribution . the shaping filter was chosen to best characterise the true spectrum of the wind , and implemented in simulink using a second order transfer function with carefully tailored gain and time constants . 5. results of the simulation : potential control issues with mains–connected “ h ” bladed vawts the full turbine/generator/inverter model was combined with the turbulent wind model to examine the effects of two different blade profiles on the turbine ’ s performance : a symmetrical naca0015 blade section and a cambered s1210 blade section [ 5 ] . the power curves created by these blade profiles are shown in the figures below , along with the windyboy load characteristics that were adopted in the simulation .

note that there is an initial negative portion in figure 4 ( a ) , which corresponds to an energy input . this means that the turbine would not self-start and would require the generator to be run as a motor to spin it up to speed . the simulations were carried out at a mean wind speed of 10 m/s . the power exported from the inverter is plotted alongside the turbulent wind input for 300 seconds , figure 5 .

figure 5 shows that the naca0015 blade section stalls after approximately 160 seconds when there is a sudden increase in wind speed , whilst the s1210 blade section continues to produce power for the full 300 seconds . this behaviour can be predicted from the power-speed characteristics of the two blade profiles in figure 8. the power curves of the naca0015 section are very narrow and do not overlap . this means if the wind speed increases suddenly , corresponding to a jump from one power curve to another at constant speed , the turbine may move from the peak of one curve to the stall zone of the next , i.e . as the wind speed increases , ∆p ( in figure 1 ) is now negative rather then positive . there is therefore no available torque to accelerate the turbine and it stalls – as observed in the simulation . this behaviour does not occur with the s1210 blade because the power curves do overlap , thus creating a positive accelerating torque as the wind speed increases . 6. conclusions a turbulent wind model has been developed and combined with a small-scale wind turbine model to allow the performance of an entire turbine/generator/inverter system to be examined in turbulent winds . this procedure was carried out for two blade sections that were considered in the design . of these , the naca0015 was found to be highly unstable in turbulent winds and would also have difficulty self-starting . the s1210 blade section suffered none of these problems and would therefore be the clear choice if a windyboy inverter was used in the system . alternatively , a symmetrical blade profile - such as the naca0015 could be used with a different inverter whose load characteristic was closer to the ideal cubic relationship of the turbine ’ s ( see figure 1 ) . this is because the windyboy ’ s linear load characteristic is a poor match for wind turbine ’ s cubic relationship and so exacerbates any potential instability problems with the turbine design . 7. references 1. dti , energy white paper : “ our energy future – creating a low carbon economy ” , dti , february 2003 . 2. bumby , jr and martin , r ; “ an axial flux , permanent magnet , air-cored generator for small scale wind turbines ” , proc . iee – electrical power applications , vol . 152 , no . 5 , sept 2005 , pp1065-1075 . 3. sma , `` windy boy grid tied inverter – operators manual addendum for the sunny boy 1800u/2500u , '' sma america , october 2003 . 4. stannard , n.j. and j.r. bumby , performance aspects of mains connected small scale wind turbines . iee proceedings part a : electric power applications , submitted 2006 . 5. kirke , b.k ; “ evaluation of self-starting vertical axis wind turbines for stand-alone applications ” , phd thesis , griffith university , april , 1998 .

a b s t r a c t
wind is one of the most promising sources of alternative energy . the construction of wind farms is destined to grow in the u.s. , possibly twenty-fold by the year 2030. to maximize the wind energy capture , this paper presents a model for wind turbine placement based on the wind distribution . the model considers wake loss , which can be calculated based on wind turbine locations , and wind direction . since the turbine layout design is a constrained optimization problem , for ease of solving it , the constraints are transformed into a second objective function . then a multi-objective evolutionary strategy algorithm is developed to solve the transformed bi-criteria optimization problem , which maximizes the expected energy output , as well as minimizes the constraint violations . the presented model is illustrated with examples as well as an industrial application . ó 2009 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved .

1. introduction the wind energy market is rapidly expanding worldwide [ 1 ] . this rapid growth of the wind energy industry has led to cost reduction challenges . there are various ways of reducing the cost of producing wind power : for example , the site selection , site layout design , predictive maintenance , and optimal control system design [ 13 ] . the wind farm layout design is an important component of ensuring the proﬁtability of a wind farm project . an inadequate wind farm layout design would lead to lower than expected wind power capture , increased maintenance costs , and so on . equation ( 1 ) captures the cost of energy ( coe ) [ 12 ]

where ci is the initial capital cost ( $ ) of the wind farm ; fcr is the ﬁxed charge rate ( % /year ) ; cr is the levelized replacement cost ( $ /year ) ; co & m is the cost of maintenance and operations ( $ /kwh ) ; aep is the annual energy production ( kwh/year ) note that at the design stage , aep is the expected ( planned ) wind energy production . the annual energy production aep is affected by the turbine availability , i.e . , the number of operational hours in a year . maximizing the aep is an effective approach for reducing the cost of energy production . in this paper , aep is improved by optimizing the wind farm layout design , speciﬁcally minimizing the wake loss .

wind farm layout has been addressed in the literature [ 4,6,9,17 ] . grady et al . [ 4 ] and mosetti et al . [ 9 ] used a genetic algorithm to minimize a weighted sum of wind energy and turbine costs . the wind farm is divided into a square grid to facilitate the encoding of a 0–1 type solution . lackner and elkinton [ 6 ] presented a general framework to optimize the offshore wind turbine layout . details of how to solve the optimization problem are neither discussed in ref . [ 6 ] , nor any other wind farm layout design tools , such as wasp [ 18 ] . castro mora et al . [ 17 ] also used a genetic algorithm to maximize an economic function , which is related to turbine parameters and locations . similarly in ref . [ 17 ] , the wind farm is represented with a square grid . one of the shortcomings of the approach presented in [ 17 ] was that wake loss was not considered . in ref . [ 4,9 ] , the wind energy calculation is not based on the power curve function , and wind direction was not fully discussed in their optimization models . this paper extends the approach of [ 6 ] by developing speciﬁc mathematical models to calculate the wake loss based on turbine locations . solution of the constrained optimization problem is fully discussed with a double-objective evolutionary strategy algorithm , which can be easily extended by considering additional constraints . 2. problem formulation and methodology modeling the wind farm layout design problem calls for assumptions . however , the assumptions made in this paper are acceptable in industrial applications and they could be modiﬁed or even removed , if necessary . assumption 1. for a wind farm project , the number of wind turbines n is ﬁxed and known before the farm is constructed .

different layout patterns , here it is assumed that all turbines are placed within a circular boundary of a wind farm . assumption 6. any two turbines in a wind farm are separated from each other by at least 4 rotor diameters . ensuring sufﬁcient spacing between adjacent turbines reduces interactions , e.g . , wind turbulence , thus diminishing the hazardous loads on the turbine . given the rotor radius r , any two wind turbines located at ( xi , yi ) and ( xj , yj ) should satisfy the inequality ðxi à xj þ2 þ ðyi à yj þ2 ! 64 r2 . assumption 6 is based on certain domain heuristics [ 8 ] . however , it can be replaced by more complex constraints . for example , the minimum distance between two turbines can be a function of the wind direction and its probability . for a single wind turbine located at ( x , y ) and wind direction q , the expected energy production is

a typical wind farm project has its total capacity goal dictated by various factors , e.g . , ﬁnances and turbine availability . for example , to achieve 150 mw ( mega watt ) capacity , a hundred 1.5 mw turbines are needed . assumption 2. wind turbine location is characterized by its twodimensional cartesian coordinates ( x , y ) , represented as a vector x of pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ the length x2 þ y2 . this assumption implies that the terrain has relatively small variations of surface roughness . the optimal solution computed in this paper is represented by n cartesian coordinates ( xi , yi ) , i ¼ 1 , . , n . assumption 3. the wind turbines considered for a wind farm are homogenous , i.e . , they all have the same power curve function p ¼ f ( v ) , where v is the wind speed at the wind turbine rotor with a ﬁxed height , p is the turbine power output . the wind turbine nacelle is usually controlled so that the rotor is oriented perpendicularly to the wind direction . for ease of turbine operations and maintenance , wind farm developers usually deal with one supplier of wind turbines delivering one turbine type . assumption 4. wind speed v ( at a given location , height , and direck tion ) follows a weibull distribution pv ðv ; k ; cþ ¼ k=cðv=cþkà1 eàðv=cþ , where k is the shape parameter , c is the scale parameter , and pv ( . ) is the probability density function . note that assumption 4 may not hold for short-time horizons ; however , a great number of sites have shown weibull distribution of the wind speed [ 8 ] . assumption 5. at a given height , wind speed ( a parameter of the weibull distribution function ) v is a continuous function of the wind direction q , i.e . , k ¼ k ( q ) , c ¼ c ( q ) , 0 q < 360. in other words , wind speeds at different locations with the same direction share the same weibull distribution across a wind farm . the parameter q is also assumed to have a continuous probability distribution pq ( q ) . in a relatively ﬂat terrain , assumption 5 is a reasonable one . moreover , if the wind farm does not cover a wide range of terrain , the wind speeds at a ﬁxed direction should share a similar distribution . future research could consider the wind speed distributions changing with directions and locations . wind direction is an important parameter in this paper . fig . 1 illustrates wind direction for a wind farm , where north is deﬁned as 90 and east is deﬁned as 0 . though wind turbines may follow

in this paper , optimizing e ( p ) is considered equivalent to optimizing aep as the number of operational hours is ﬁxed . note that in equation ( 3 ) , the wind speed is integrated from 0 to inﬁnity , which is equivalent to integrating the wind speed from 0 to the cut-out speed . once the wind speed is greater than the cut-out speed , a wind turbine is shut down for safety and it produces zero energy . model ( 4 ) represents an ideal scenario for maximizing the total wind energy captured by turbines , where the interactions among turbines are neglected , with r being the radius of the wind farm . note that the circular boundary of a wind farm can be easily modiﬁed to a rectangular boundary .

the major interactions among the turbines result in the energy loss caused by the wind turbine wakes . a wind farm design for the maximum of wind energy capture must minimize the wake effects among turbines . 2.1. the wake loss model wake loss is an important factor in considering wind park layout design [ 10 ] . when a uniform incoming wind encounters a wind turbine , a linearly expanding wake behind the turbine occurs [ 5,6 ] . a portion of the free stream wind ’ s speed will be reduced from its original speed vup to vdown . fig . 2 illustrates the basic concept of wake behind a wind turbine .

calculated based on wind turbine locations , the power curve function needs be determined for estimation of the expected power production . 3. power curve though a power curve p ¼ f ( v ) usually resembles a sigmoid function , it could be described as a linear function with a tolerable error . for example , model ( 17 ) illustrates a linear power curve function , where vcutàin is the cut-in wind speed . if the wind speed is smaller than the cut-in speed , there is no power output because the torque is not sufﬁcient enough to turn the generator . similarly , if the wind speed is greater than the rated speed and smaller than the cut-out speed vcutàout , the wind turbine control system will keep the power output stable ( ﬁxed at prated ) to protect the system from hazardous loads . when the wind speed is between the cut-in and rated speed , the power output follows a linear equation , where l is the slope parameter , and h is the intercept parameter . in future research , the linear power curve function could be replaced by a more accurate nonlinear approximation .

however , if the wind speed is discretized into small bins , the integration can be approximated with the riemann sum [ 11 ] . later in the paper , the wind speed and its direction are discretized so that numerical integration can be performed . it needs to be noted that continuous wind characteristics are not available in the design of wind farms .

substituting equation ( 18 ) into model ( 4 ) makes it is easy to solve the resultant optimization model . once wind speed and wind direction are discretized into small bins , ci ( . ) and k ( . ) can estimated from the historical wind data . discretization makes the calculation of the expected power tractable . though model ( 4 ) is a constrained nonlinear optimization problem , considering nonlinear power curves or more complex wake loss models , and additional constraints would increase its complexity . thus selecting a ﬂexible optimization algorithm is important . this model complexity warrants the use of a population based search algorithm , such as the evolutionary strategy algorithm .

minimizing obj1equals maximizing the expected energy output . the minimum of obj2 is zero , which means all constraints are satisﬁed . to solve the double-objective optimization problem , an evolutionary strategy algorithm , spea [ 14 ] , is used . this algorithm matches the complexity of the underlying problem . 5.1. the algorithm 1 initialize three empty sets parent , offspring and elite . randomly generate mchild individuals ( solutions ) to form the initial children population and place them in offspring . 2 repeat until the stopping criterion is satisﬁed . 2.1 find non-dominated solutions in offspring and copy them into elite . remove dominated solutions in elite . reduce the size of elite by clustering , if necessary . 2.2 fitness assignment : assign ﬁtness to individuals in offspring and elite . 2.3 selection : use tournament selection to select mparent individuals from offspringwelite and store them in parent . 2.4 recombination : generate a new population offspring by selecting two parents in parent . 2.5 mutation : mutate the individuals in offspring . 2.6 assign ﬁtness to the individuals in offspring . the stopping criterion in this paper is the number of generations . 5.2. mutation an individual ( zj , sj ) can be mutated by following the equations ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) , with sj mutated ﬁrst , zj mutated next .

6. computational study to illustrate the concepts presented in this paper , numerical examples and an industrial case study are presented . the wind turbines used in this paper have the following parameters : rotor radius is 38.5 ( m ) ; cut-in speed is 3.5 ( m/s ) ; rated speed is 14 ( m/s ) ; rated power is 1500 ( kw ) . for the linear power curve function , l ¼ 140.86 , h ¼ à500 . hub height is 80 ( m ) . the thrust coefﬁcient ct is assumed to be 0.8 , the spreading constant k is assumed to be 0.075 for land cases . knowing the cut-in wind speed and the rated wind speed , wind speed is divided at nv ¼ 20 intervals of 0.5 ( m ) each . similarly , the wind direction is divided at nq ¼ 23 intervals of 15 each . some of the parameters of the evolutionary algorithm used in this paper are ﬁxed throughout all experiments . the tournament size is ﬁxed at 4. initial population zj is generated by uniformly sampling from [ àr , r ] . during the optimization process , all solutions are checked for non-violation of the interval constraint . similarly sj is limited to [ slow , sup ] set at [ 1 , r/20 ] . in other words , the minimum standard deviation for mutating the solution is set at 1 ( m ) ; the maximum standard deviation is heuristically set at 1/20of the farm radius , and it increases with the farm radius . based on the heuristic pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ knowledge [ 15 ] , s0 is calculated as s0 ¼ 1= 4n , s is calculated as pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ s ¼ 1= 2 2n . the number of generations in this paper is set to 100 .

fig . 6. layout solutions for different number of turbines given the wind characteristics in table 1 .

6.1. wind scenario 1 the illustrative example used in this paper assumes that the farm radius r ¼ 500 ( m ) ; the wind characteristic of this example is described in table 1 , which was obtained from analyzing historical wind data . the data in table 1 can be read as follows : when wind direction is between 0 and 15 , the wind speed follows a weibull distribution with k ¼ 2 , c ¼ 13 ; the probability for wind blowing between 0 and 15 is zero . similarly , when wind direction is between 90 and 105 , the wind speed follows a weibull distribution with k ¼ 2 , c ¼ 13 ; the probability for wind blowing between 90 and 105 is 0.6. table 1 shows that wind blows predominantly from 75 to 105 with a probability of 0.8. to illustrate the algorithm ’ s ability to optimize the wind farm layout , different numbers of turbines ( 2–6 turbines ) are considered . fig . 6 shows the optimal layout solutions for different numbers of turbines . the optimal solutions are obtained through mparent/ mchild ¼ 20/120 , for 100 generations . during the optimization process , the elite set size is limited to 50. when there are more than 50 individuals in the elite set , a clustering procedure is activated to delete individuals with the same objective function values or similar geometric positions . based on fig . 6 , for two turbines to be placed within the farm radius , the algorithm places the two turbines on the boundary of the circle . the line connecting the two turbines appears to be perpendicular to the major wind direction ( 90 –105 ) . when there are three turbines to be placed , the algorithm positions the two turbines ( lower part of fig . 6 ) across the major wind direction , and attempts to locate the third turbine as far as possible from the other two turbines , and to keep it from the wakes of the other two turbines given the major wind direction .

as shown in fig . 6 , when there are 4 , 5 or 6 turbines to be located , the algorithm selects the locations , avoiding the wake losses under the major wind directions . fig . 7 shows the initial population and the population at the 100th generation for the 6 turbines . it is easy to see that the algorithm converges as the number of generations increases . however , 100 generations are enough to converge for the data used in this example .

fig . 8. six layouts of turbines generated by using another initial population size .

for a large number of turbines , the search space expands due the increased number of individuals in the es algorithm . thus increasing the initial population size seems to be a viable way to search for optimal solutions . fig . 8 shows two optimal solutions generated with different population sizes . the triangle shapes indicate the locations generated when mparent/mchild ¼ 20/120 . the square shapes show the locations generated when mparent/ mchild ¼ 200/1200 . using mparent/mchild ¼ 20/120 , the algorithm can ﬁnd obj1 ¼1.1939 â 10à5 . using mparent/mchild ¼ 200/1200 , the algorithm ﬁnds obj1 ¼1.1937 â 10à5 , which is a better value than in the case of a smaller initial population . note that increasing the population size leads to better quality solutions . it is worth mentioning that the tournament size should also be modiﬁed when the population size changes .

while minimizing the wake loss generated by the third turbine from the major wind directions . as in fig . 9 , when there are 4 , 5 or 6 turbines to be located , the algorithm selects the locations , avoiding the wake losses under the major wind directions . note that when the wind direction displays a wide range , it is almost impossible for human heuristics to derive an optimal solution . in this case , a wind farm layout optimization tool is necessary for designing turbine locations . 6.3. wake loss if it is assumed that there is no wake loss , the expected power can be calculated from equation ( 22 ) by substituting ci ( . ) with c ( . ) in equation ( 18 ) . in this scenario , optimal turbine locations only need to satisfy the distance constraints .

6.2. wind scenario 2 table 2 shows the wind data collected from an industrial wind farm . for this wind farm , the wind blows predominantly from 120 to 225 , which is a wider direction spectrum than that of wind scenario 1. wind scenario 1 is easier to see whether the optimization results make sense in terms of minimizing wake loss . fig . 9 shows the optimal layout solutions for different numbers of turbines ( 2–6 ) . in this wind scenario 2 , wind farm radius is still assumed to be 500 ( m ) . all the solutions are generated with mparent/mchild ¼ 20/120 , for 100 generations . the line connecting the two turbines pretends to be perpendicular to the major wind direction ( 120 –225 ) . when there are three turbines to be placed , the algorithm positions the two turbines across the major wind direction , and attempts to locate the third turbine as far as possible from the other two turbines ,

thus equation ( 22 ) can be regarded as the ideal scenario where the maximum expected energy production from a wind turbine can be achieved . for a given number of turbines , equation ( 22 ) can be used to calculate the ideal energy production for a wind farm without considering wake loss . once the wake loss is considered , adding additional turbines to the wind farm may cause energy loss . tables 3 and 4 are generated based on the two different wind scenarios , 1 and 2 .

the data in table 3 is read as : when there are two turbines to be placed in a wind farm , the optimized solution generated by the evolutionary algorithm provides 28083.42 kw of expected energy production ( note that the yearly production is not computed ) . if there is no wake loss , the ideal energy production is 28091.47 kw ; the potential wake loss under this layout solution is calculated by using 28091.47 à 28083.42 ¼ 8.05. tables 3 and 4 show that as the number of turbines increases , the wake loss increases . fig . 10 shows that for two different wind scenarios , the wake loss of wind scenario 1 is similar to the wake loss of wind scenario 2 when the number of turbines is 2–5 . when the number of turbines is 6 , the wake loss of wind scenario 2 is signiﬁcantly higher than that of wind scenario 1. the reason is obvious , as wind scenario 2 includes a wider range of wind directions with a certain probability . however , in wind scenario 1 , the wind direction is limited to 75 –105 ; other wind directions have almost zero probability , which makes it easier to place turbines and avoid wake loss . based on fig . 10 , for a given wind farm radius , it is obvious that there should be some limit on the number of turbines to be placed on a farm . locating too many turbines will signiﬁcantly increase wake loss . based on the constraints listed in model ( 4 ) , placing 7 turbines within a wind farm of a 500-m radius is not possible . the

although a global optimal solution is not guaranteed , the quality of the generated solutions is acceptable for industrial applications . future research can focus on considering different terrains , e.g . , the terrain height information could be incorporated into the model . furthermore , wind turbine parameter selection could be considered based on the wind farm wind characteristics . for example , for a low wind speed area , there is no need to select large turbines with a high cut-in speed . in other words , it is desirable to maximize the wind turbine capacity utilization factor subject to investment and operational constraints .

evolutionary algorithm does not generate a feasible solution when the number of turbines is 7. the minimum distance between two turbines is violated . 7. conclusion a generic model for optimizing in-land wind farm layout was presented . the optimization model considered wind farm radius and turbine distance constraints . however , other constraints can be easily incorporated in this model . the model maximizes the energy production by placing wind turbines in such a way that the wake loss is minimized . as the optimization model is nonlinear , and it is hard to derive an analytical solution from the integration part , wind speed and wind direction are discretized into small bins so that the integration can be approximated with discrete summations . a bi-objective evolutionary strategy algorithm was adopted to solve the constrained nonlinear optimization problem . both the expected energy production and the constraint violation were optimized . the optimal solution maximized energy production while satisfying all constraints . although the wake loss model considered in this paper is a simple one , more complex wake loss models can be considered in the optimization approach discussed in the paper . the complex nonlinear model was solved by the evolutionary strategy algorithm .

chalothorn thumthae and tawit chitsomboon*
school of mechanical engineering , institute of engineering , suranaree university of technology , nakorn ratchasima , thailand abstract : this paper presents the numerical simulation of horizontal axis wind turbines with untwisted blade in steady state condition . the objective is for investigating the condition for the optimal pitch that produces the highest power output . the numerical solution is carried out by solving conservation equations for mass and momenta in three dimensions using the unstructured-grid finite volume methodology ( fluent code ) . the rotating reference frame technique was used wherein the blades are fixed in relation to the rotating frame . local grid refinement technique was employed and grid-independent study was also performed . computational results of the 12 degree pitch are compared with field experimental data of the national renewable laboratory ( usa ) , for both inviscid and turbulent conditions . the computational results give good agreement with experimental results both for inviscid and viscous conditions if stall do not occur ( at 80 % span ) . however , if stall occurs ( at 30 % span ) , the results of both inviscid and viscous simulations are quite different from the experiment . for power output comparison ; the k-epsilon case produces only +3.6 % errors . the power outputs reach maximum at the 8.82 degree and 4.2 degree pitch at wind speed 10.5 m/s and 7.2 m/s respectively . keywords : wind turbine , hawt , untwisted blade , optimal pitch , maximum power

1. introduction
twisted blade for wind turbine has proved to be superior to the untwisted one due to its full utilization of blade area to produce lift . however , untwisted blade type is still useful for small and medium wind turbine because of its ease in manufacturing , hence cost . this research uses cfd to study the flow pass the horizontal axis wind turbines . the flow is quite complex because of the rotation of the turbine , coupled with turbulence and stall effects . the joint efforts undertaken by several european union research labs and the united state 's national renewable energy laboratory ( nrel ) has documented and made available experimental field data for several different wind turbines [ 1 ] . users and numerical analysts have ready access to this data , known as iea annex xiv , by either extracting it from the written report or by downloading the electronic data files from website http : //www.ecn.nl/wind/other/iea/index.en.html . the data that is used in comparison for validating the numerical solutions in this paper is the experiment of nrel phase ii wind turbine [ 2 ] . the phase ii configuration has a rotor that rotates at a constant 72 rpm and rated at 20 kw of electrical power . this fixed-pitch rotor has a diameter of 10.1 meters , untwisted blades , and constant chord of 0.458 meters . the rotor uses the nrel s809 airfoil through out the span with some modifications towards the root to blend with the hub spar . this configuration is shown in fig.1 . the rotor hub is fixed at a pre-cone of 3o and a fixed pitch of 12o . the blade section of s809 airfoil and pitch angle are shown in fig.2

the observer then sees the relative velocity , u r = u − ( ω × r ) , where ur is relative velocity , u is absolute velocity , ω is the angular velocity of the rotating frame , and r is the position vector in the rotating frame . the momentum equation in terms of relative velocity becomes ,

turbine [ 4 ] ; it needs high computational time and large computer memory . the method of rotating reference frame [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] is easier to implement and it is appropriate for the steady state simulation . in this method , the blade is fixed while the reference axis is rotating .

in this study , steady state , incompressible flow is assumed . the numerical solution is carried out by solving the conservation equations for mass and momenta in three dimensions using the unstructured-grid finite volume methodology ( fluent code ) . the sequential algorithm , semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equation ( simple ) [ 11 ] , is used in solving all scalar variables . for the convective terms of momentum equations , the quick interpolating scheme [ 12 ] is applied . for turbulence equations , in order to prevent the unbounded problems often associated with the quick scheme [ 9 ] , 1st order upwind scheme is applied . the computational conditions are as shown in table 1. the computational grid is shown in fig . 3. the solution is carried out for only one blade domain instead of the full three blades because of symmetry . grid around the blade section is shown in fig . 4. hexahedral grid is used in the blade near field for higher accuracy of computation in the boundary layer ; moreover , the hexahedral grid is more efficient for the local grid refinement . in this study y+ value is varied in the boundary layer to check for grid dependency . table 1 computational conditions density 0.976 kg/m3 operating pressure 80,592 pa wind velocity 10.6 and 7.2 m/s rotational speed 72.0 rpm blade pitch 1,3,5,7 and 12 degree pressure correction interpolating scheme viscous model near wall treatment residual error simple quick ( momentum ) 1st order upwind ( turbulence ) standard k − ε and inviscid standard wall function ( log- law ) 5x10-5

2.2 experimental data correlation experimental data was measured as power from generator . to compare with cfd , it is needed to be converted to mechanical power . according to the annex xiv report , mechanical power can be calculated easily by :

3. results and discussion
3.1 cfd results the calculation started on the normal mesh , after that , the local grid refinement was performed in boundary layer region until grid independent solution was attained . the final y+ for grid independent solution was found to be about 250 and lower . the comparisons of generator power are shown in fig.6 . the cfd results show reasonably good agreements with experimental data . the solution with k- ε turbulence model underpredicted the experiment data by 3.6 % and 24.8 % at wind speed 10.5 m/s and 7.2 m/s , respectively . the rather large percentage error at low speed could be attributable to the uncertainty in the experimental correlation in this region , as can be seen from fig . 5. the power output in this region is small , so any small absolute error due to correlation could make a large contribution to the percentage error . the inviscid calculation , while generally appeared to be very reasonable , overpredicted the experiment ; this is anticipated since inviscid flow lacks viscous drag . fig . 7 shows the comparison of pressure coefficients . the numerical solutions , both inviscid and viscous cases , are quite close to experimental data at 80 % span . at 30 % span , however , both predicted results are not in good agreement with the experiment because of the effect of flow separation due to the high angle of attack . the velocity flow fields are shown in fig.8 , the flow is attached to the blade at 80 % span , but is separated at 30 % span . fortunately , this pressure errors do not highly affect the power output because it occurs at inner blade span which contributes little to the total power output . with some confidence in the validity of cfd , the pitch is now varied to see its effect . the simulation with viscous effect is selected because of its higher accuracy . the predicted power at various blade pitch angles for both wind speed 10.5 m/s and 7.2 m/s are shown in fig 6. rough “ eye-balling ” estimate seems to give optimal pitches at 9 and 4 degrees for the wind speed 10.5 m/s and 7.2 m/s , respectively . the better method to estimate the optimum pitch angles is by using curve fitting . from the method of least square with polynomial degree 3 ( equations shown in fig.6 ) , the optimum blade pitches are determined to be at 8.82 degree for wind speed 10.5 m/s and 4.2 degree for wind speed 7.2 m/s . 3.2 correlation analysis for optimal pitch the computation has shown that the pitch , hence angle of attack , strongly affects turbine power output . the angle of attack can be calculated from the simple relation :

α = arctan

u∞  ωr

  −θp 

( 8 )

where α is angle of attack , θ p is blade pitch angle and r is the local radius of blade . at the design point of untwisted blade , normally at 80 % span , the angle of attacks corresponding to the optimal points are computed as 10.25o and 9.06o for wind speeds 10.5 m/s and 7.2 m/s , respectively . experimental lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio versus angle of attacks are shown in fig . 9. the value 10.25o and 9.06o is very close to the maximum lift in pre-stall region ( about 9.5o ) . moreover , the higher value of angle of attack for the higher speed case also correlates with the rightward shift trend of the curves for higher reynolds number . fig 9 ( b ) dictates that optimal lift to drag is nominally at 6 degree . unlike aircraft wing which is often designed at the maximum lift to drag point , the wind turbine seems to be optimal at the maximum lift point . this is quite consistent with the blade element theory which indicates that power depends strongly on lift and relatively weakly on lift to drag ratio .

4. conclusion
cfd is used to predict the optimal blade pitch angles that give maximum power for wind turbine . for wind speeds 10.5 m/s and 7.2 m/s , optimal pitches occur at 8.82 degree and 4.2 degree respectively . both values , when examined at 80 % span , correlate to the maximum lift point in pre-stall regions . this , perhaps , could be used as a design criterion for an untwisted blade horizontal axis wind turbine .

30 mw wind power farm in a suitable area of the western united states . the generated power will be sold to the usa electric grid , or to local consumers . this project will be executed as a joint venture with enerquest power development corporation . all proposals should emphasize those policy issues that would give the joint-venture best chances for approval ( i.e . : new , inventive solutions , technology transfer , workers ' training , alternative processes , local equipment procurement , export potential , etc . ) . project background advance \d4wind energy projects provide cost-effective and reliable energy in the united states and abroad . the u.s. wind industry currently generates about 3.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year -- enough to meet the annual electricity needs of 1 million people . wind energy installations are going up across the country as utilities realize the benefits of adding clean , low-cost , reliable wind energy to their resource portfolios . advance \d4the u.s. department of energy and nrel are helping bring wind energy , a clean , low-cost generation option , to the marketplace in the united states and abroad . activities such as the wind energy deployment project , international cooperative projects and technical assistance , and standards development all help hasten the adoption of wind energy technology . advance \d4the electricity generated by wind turbines is used for many applications , from large , utility-scale power plants , to small , single turbines for home or village use . wind energy 's popularity is growing because of its many benefits : wind energy generates pollution-free electricity ; the fuel source , wind , blows steadily in many areas ; wind energy costs compete with conventional fossil-fueled power plants in some areas ; and costs continue to drop as technology improves . environmental issues advance \d4wind energy is considered a green power technology because it has only minor impacts on the environment . wind energy plants produce no air pollutants or greenhouse gases . however , any means of energy production impacts the environment in some way , and wind energy is no different . aesthetics and visual impacts : elements that influence visual impacts include the spacing , design , and uniformity of the turbines . birds and other living resources : pre-construction surveys can indicate whether birds or other living resources are likely to be affected by wind turbines . global warming : wind energy can help fight global warming . wind turbines produce no air emissions or greenhouse gases . lightning : ongoing research and increased operator experience are improving the understanding of lightning and wind turbines . noise : like all mechanical systems , wind turbines produce some noise when they operate . in recent years , engineers have made design changes to reduce the noise from wind turbines . tv/radio interference : in the past , older turbines with metal blades caused television interference in areas near the turbine . interference from modern turbines is unlikely because many components formerly made of metal are now made from composites . advance \d4wind resource the wind is the fuel source for wind energy . the united states has many areas with abundant winds , particularly in the midwest and great plains . understanding the wind resource is a crucial step in planning a wind energy project . detailed knowledge of the wind at a site is needed to estimate the performance of a wind energy project . wind energy is very abundant in many parts of the united states . wind resources are characterized by wind-power density classes , ranging from class 1 ( the lowest ) to class 7 ( the highest ) . good wind resources ( class 3 and above ) which have an average annual wind speed of at least 13 miles per hour , are found along the east coast , the appalachian mountain chain , the great plains , the pacific northwest , and some other locations . north dakota , alone , has enough energy from class 4 and higher winds to supply 36 % of the electricity of the lower 48 states . of course , it would be impractical to move electricity everywhere from north dakota . wind speed is a critical feature of wind resources , because the energy in wind is proportional to the cube of the wind speed . in other words , a stronger wind means a lot more power . political issues : wind project siting faces unique hurdles : despite it ’ s status as the fastest growing renewable energy source , wind power faces numerous obstacles in siting and permitting . this is true for both large projects being built to sell power to utilities and small projects being built for a single user . regulations and laws governing power project siting are becoming ever more complex , and state and federal siting agencies are not as likely to approve power projects without extensive review . various interest groups have become more involved in siting procedures as well . large wind projects raise many of the same siting issues as other energy projects . there may be concern about truck traffic during construction , health effects of electromagnetic fields from transmission lines and social issues . wind projects also face some unique challenges that require special consideration . land use : unlike most power plants , wind generation projects are not land intensive . on a mw output basis , the land required for a wind project exceeds the amount of land required for most other energy technology , but the physical project footprint covers only a small portion of that land . for example , a 50 mw wind facility may occupy a 1,500-acre site , but it will only use three to five percent of the total acreage , leaving the remainder available for other uses . because wind generation is limited to areas with strong and fairly consistent wind resources , most wind generation is sited in rural and relatively open areas that are often already used for agriculture , grazing , recreation , forest management or seasonal flood storage . to ensure that a wind project is compatible with existing land uses , the layout and design of the wind project can be adjusted in a variety of ways , including : selecting equipment with minimal guide wires placing electrical collection lines underground placing maintenance facilities off site consolidating equipment on the turbine tower or foundation consolidating structures within a selected area using the most efficient or largest turbines to minimize the number of turbines required increasing turbine spacing to reduce density of machines using road-less construction and maintenance techniques , or using existing access roads . other land use strategies include using buffer zones and setbacks to separate wind projects from sensitive or incompatible land uses . land use agencies in california have established setbacks ranging from two to four times the height of a turbine or a minimum of 500 to 1,200 feet from any residential area . minnesota has established minimum setbacks of 500 feet from occupied dwellings . advance \d4 what are the advantages of wind-generated electricity ? numerous public opinion surveys have consistently shown that the public prefers wind and other renewable energy forms to conventional sources of generation . wind energy is a free , renewable resource , so no matter how much is used today , there will still be the same supply in the future . wind energy is also a source of clean , non-polluting , electricity . unlike conventional power plants , wind plants emit no air pollutants or greenhouse gases . in 1990 , california 's wind power plants offset the emission of more than 2.5 billion pounds of carbon dioxide , and 15 million pounds of other pollutants that would have otherwise been produced . it would take a forest of 90 million to 175 million trees to provide the same air quality . advance \d4 what are the economic obstacles to greater wind power usage ? even though the cost of wind power has decreased dramatically in the past 10 years , the technology requires a higher initial investment than fossil-fueled generators . roughly 80 % of the cost is the machinery , with the balance being the site preparation and installation . if wind-generating systems are compared with fossil-fueled systems on a `` life-cycle '' cost basis ( counting fuel and operating expenses for the life of the generator ) , however , wind costs are more competitive with other generating technologies because there is no fuel to purchase and minimal operating expenses . advance \d4 are there other drawbacks to the use of wind energy ? the major challenge to using wind as a source of power is that it is intermittent and it does not always blow when electricity is needed . wind can not be stored ( unless batteries are used ) ; and not all winds can be harnessed to meet the timing of electricity demands . further , good wind sites are often located in remote locations far from areas of electric power demand ( such as cities ) . finally , wind resource development may compete with other uses for the land and those alternative uses may be more highly valued than electricity generation . however , wind turbines can be located on land that is also used for grazing or even farming . advance \d4 is the cost of wind power competitive with conventional power plants ? new , utility-scale , wind projects are being built all around the united states today with energy costs ranging from 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour ( at very windy sites in texas ) to 5 cents or more ( in the pacific northwest ) . these costs are competitive with the direct operating costs of many conventional forms of electricity generation now -- and prices are expected to drop even further over the next 10 years . since wind is an intermittent electricity generator and does not provide power on an `` as needed '' basis , it has to compare favorably with the costs saved on fuel from fossil generators . advance \d4 can homeowners sell excess electricity to the utility ? under the public utilities regulatory policy act of 1978 ( purpa ) , any qualifying individual can install a wind generator and the local electric utility must pay for any excess power produced . purpa was specifically intended to create a market for clean , renewable , electric-generating technologies by guaranteeing a buyer for the excess power . prior to purpa , selling power to the utility was an option but was the discretion of the utility . with purpa , small power producers meeting specific criteria are guaranteed purchase and interconnection . many states now permit `` net metering , '' in which the utility must buy wind power generated by homeowners at the same retail rate the utility charges . this essentially allows the customer 's meter to turn backward while wind energy is supplied to the grid by the customer 's turbine . economic issues although the nation ’ s wind potential is very large , only part of it can be exploited economically . the economic viability of wind power will vary from utility to utility . important factors not addressed in this study that influence land availability and wind electric potential include production/demand match ( seasonal and daily ) , transmission and access constraints , public acceptance , and other technological and institutional constraints . advance \d4to provide 20 % of the nation ’ s electricity , only about 0.6 % of the land of the lower 48 states would have to be developed with wind turbines . furthermore , wind turbines , electrical equipment , and access roads would occupy less than 5 % of this land . most existing land use , such as farming and ranching , could remain as it is now . advance \d4 is wind energy good for the economy ? wind energy avoids the external or societal costs associated with conventional resources , namely , the trade deficit from importing foreign oil and other fuels , the health and environmental costs of pollution , and the cost of depleted resources . wind energy is a domestic , reliable resource that provides more jobs per dollar invested than any other energy technology -- more than five times that from coal or nuclear power . in 1994 , wind turbine and component manufacturers contributed directly to the economies of 44 states , creating thousands of jobs for americans . advance \d4 the u.s. electric power industry is a combination of electric utilities ( investor-owned , publicly owned , cooperatives , and federal ) and non-utility power producers . investor-owned electric utilities account for over three-fourths of the sales of electricity and revenue in the industry . historically , the investor-owned electric utilities served the large consolidated markets and operated in all states except nebraska . hawaii is the only state in which all electricity is supplied by investor-owned electric utilities . advance \d4publicly owned electric utilities are nonprofit operations that have been established to serve their communities and nearby consumers at cost . the publicly owned electric utilities in this publication include municipals , public power districts , state authorities , irrigation districts , and other state organizations . publicly owned electric utilities are exempt from taxes and can obtain new financing at lower rates than investor-owned electric utilities . advance \d4the publicly owned electric utilities are divided into generators and non-generators ( in contrast , virtually all investor-owned electric utilities own and operate generating capacity ) . generators are those electric utilities that have investment in electric utility plant and production to supply some or all of their consumer needs . however , many generators can supplement their demand by purchasing power . the non-generators can not produce electric power for end use and rely exclusively on purchasing power . their primary function is to transmit and distribute electricity to their consumers . the non-generators comprise over half of the total number of major publicly owned electric utilities . advance \d4cooperative electric utilities are owned by their members and are established to provide electricity to those members . the rural electrification administration ( prior to the rural utilities service ) , u.s. department of agriculture , was established under the rural electrification act of 1936 with the purpose to extend electric service to small rural communities ( usually under 1,500 consumers ) and farms where it was more expensive to provide service . the national rural utilities cooperative finance corporation , the federal financing bank , and the bank for cooperatives are the most important sources of debt financing for cooperatives . cooperative borrowers ( 695 of 901 in 1999 total cooperatives ) currently operate in 46 states . financial data for the cooperative borrowers are found in the statistical report , rural electric borrowers published by the rural utilities service of the u.s. department of agriculture . federal electric utilities are also presented in this publication and include the four federal power-marketing administrations , the tennessee valley authority , and the u.s. bureau of indian affairs . the four federal power-marketing administrations are the bonneville power administration , the southeastern power administration , the southwestern power administration , and the western area power administration . primarily water resources generate electric power produced by federal electric utilities . this power , which is not produced for profit , is primarily sold in the wholesale market to other electric utilities rather than being distributed to ultimate consumers . as required by law , publicly owned and cooperative electric utilities are given preference in the purchase of this less expensive power produced by the federal electric utilities . advance \d4 industry profile : key facts of sales and revenues in 1999 are : the 2,008 publicly owned electric utilities , which accounted for close to two-thirds of all electric utilities , accounted for 14.6 percent of all revenues from sales to ultimate consumers and 18.3 percent of all revenues from sales for resale . the 900 cooperative electric utilities ( more than a quarter of all electric utilities ) accounted for 8.9 percent of all revenues from sales to ultimate consumers and 19.9 percent of all revenues from sales for resale . the 9 federal electric utilities accounted for 0.6 percent of all revenues from sales to ultimate consumers and 14.7 percent of all revenues from sales for resale . the average ultimate consumers revenue per kilowatt-hour ranged from 2.4 to 6.8 cents depending on the type of electric utility servicing them . the overall average was 6.7 cents . the average sales for resale revenue per kilowatt-hour ranged from 3.5 to 4.9 cents , depending on the type of electric utility making the sale . the overall average was 4.3 cents . economic context : economic growth characterized 1999 with the real gross domestic product ( gdp ) growing by 4.0 percent , a slight decrease from 4.3 percent in 1998. economic expansion maintained considerable momentum during 1999. this is the fourth year in a row in which the federal reserve used minimal intervention to stimulate the economy . another sign of the sturdy economy was that industrial production indexes increased a robust 3.6 percent last year . the consumer price index ( cpi ) rose a slight 2.2 percent during 1999 , up slightly from 1.6 percent in 1998. capacity utilization was 80.7 percent for 1999. this represents the eighth year in a row where the measure of economic activity as a percent of capacity has been over 80 percent . advance \d4 generator electric utilities versus non-generator electric utilities : the next section of the publication discusses generator and non-generator electric utilities separately . the two groups are distinct because of operational differences resulting in significantly different financial pro-files . for example , significant plant production expenses would not exist for non-generator electric utilities because existing production plant expenses are mainly maintenance costs for standby plants . it should be noted that both generator and non-generator electric utilities report according to varying fiscal years that are determined by their political localities . because non-generator electric utilities purchase all their power needs , they have less plant investment than generator electric utilities per dollar of revenue generated . in 1999 , generator electric utilities had $ 3.71 of electric utility plant ( without nuclear fuel ) per dollar of electric utility operating revenue , com-pared with $ 1.22 for non-generator electric utilities . operation and maintenance ( o & m ) expenses represent very different costs between the two groups of electric utilities . purchase power expenses , which comprise the majority of non-generators ' o & m expenses , contain all the associated costs for the generating plants from which the power was purchased , including depreciation . this causes non-generators ' o & m expenses to appear higher than generators ' o & m expenses on a mills per kilowatt-hour basis . in 1999 , non-generators ' o & m expenses were 87.1 percent of revenues and depreciation was only 3.9 percent . for generators , depreciation of plant is shown directly , since all or their own plants meet some of their generating needs . generators ' o & m expenses represented only 63.8 percent of revenues , but depreciation was 12.1 percent of revenues . financing is also different for the two groups . generator electric utilities , with their larger plant investments per dollar of revenue , have more debt per dollar of revenue than non-generator electric utilities . the large amount of debt creates greater interest expense . interest expense represented 14.2 percent of revenues in 1999 for the generators versus just 1.2- percent of revenues for the non-generators ( tables 7 and 18 ) . wind power incentives in the u.s. : provision for

installed wind energy equipment , ( 2 ) 15 % energy investment tax credit . in california , there was also a 25 % investment tax credit on the value of the installed equipment . california 's itc was

output : minimum 750 kw per tower annual output : minimum 20,000 megawatt hours per year turbine design : horizontal axis . designing a brain for tomorrow 's wind turbines in the past , turbine controls were used to solve particular problems : to slow or stop the rotor , to prevent wind gusts from suddenly producing too much power , to prevent the turbine from vibrating during operation , to mitigate damage from turbulent winds , and so on . a better way to control a wind turbine is via an electronic brain , or smart controller , which can optimize every aspect of turbine operation . smart controllers use miniature computers , called microprocessors , to continuously evaluate wind conditions and turbine operation at any given moment . the controller then adjusts turbine operation to maximize the amount of power it generates , to protect the machine from excessive wear and tear , and to ensure maximum service life , low energy costs , and safe operation . such a controller will ensure the maximum benefit from using light , flexible rotors and custom generators . engineers at nrel and sandia are working with university researchers to design a computerized control system for wind turbines . starting with a computer model that includes control strategies to solve typical problems , they are programming it to systematically evaluate a particular strategy 's costs and benefits under a variety of conditions . the smart control system will assess how a particular device such as a tip brake affects the entire wind turbine . it will decide whether using it makes more sense than another method for slowing the rotor . in the future , system control specialists will work on designing new turbines from the beginning . understanding how a wind turbine works , they will be able to design smart control systems as an integral feature of the next generation of utility wind turbines . tower structure : lattice configuration or tubular steel foundation : for lattice configuration - four ( 4 ) individually drilled caissons - diameter and depth to be determined by size of structure . for tubular steel design - concrete cylinder with depth and width to be determined by size of structure . footprint : for lattice configuration - square base - spaced 1 - 2,000 feet apart . for tubular steel design -circular base - spaced 1 - 2,000 feet apart . footprint dimensions determined by size of structure . concrete : amount to be determined by tower structure chosen and number of towers . steel reinforcement : contingent on type of tower chosen for project . height : height from ground level to hub axis should exceed nearest vertical obstacle by 100 feet or more . taller towers reach for the wind wind speed generally increases with height above the ground . taller towers expose turbines to stronger winds , enabling them to produce more electricity . until now , the value of the extra electricity has been nearly offset by the cost of materials to make the towers bigger , at least for traditional steel lattice or tube towers . however , innovative tower designs are allowing taller towers to be built at reduced cost . consequently , average tower height should gradually increase from 100 feet to about 230 feet by about 2005. weight : to be determined by the tower structure chosen . blade length : 24 - 34 meters ( 79 - 112 feet ) . rotor diameter : 50 - 80 meters ( 165 - 263 feet ) . innovative rotors increase energy capture rotors are large , heavy , and crucial to capturing energy from the wind . because improvements in rotor design have a great impact on energy costs , the national renewable energy laboratory and sandia national laboratories have looked into new designs for airfoils ; innovative hub attachments that allow rotors to be more flexible ; and improved manufacturing processes for blades . airfoils specifically designed for turbine blades can greatly enhance turbine performance . airfoils are the cross-sectional shapes on airplane wings or turbine blades that convert airflow into forces that can lift an airplane or turn a turbine rotor . since 1984 , nrel researchers have created seven `` families '' of airfoils for turbine blades of specific sizes . the new airfoils can increase energy capture by as much as 30 % in constant-speed rotors . they are used on the z-40 , awt-26 , awt-27 , and aoc 15/50 wind turbines . turbine rotors with two blades capture about the same amount of energy as their three-bladed counterparts and are much less expensive to build . however , two-bladed rotors must be flexible enough to respond to wind gusts and dissipate forces in the wind that would otherwise impact the turbine . in 1994 , nrel began a research project at the nwtc to study hub designs that allow such flexibility . in 1997 , researchers built a new research hub that will allow them to evaluate two key strategies for designing flexible , two-bladed rotors . in one approach , each blade will have a hinge at its base ( root ) that allows both blades to bend downwind in high winds . in the other strategy , the blades will be linked together and attached to the low-speed shaft by means of a single hinge . researchers will install the hub on a research turbine , study both strategies , and determine which one works best . their goal is to prepare for the development of a new class of lightweight , flexible wind turbines whose high-performance rotors will significantly lower the cost of energy production . sandia is also striving to lower the cost of turbine rotors by working with industry to improve manufacturing of turbine blades . by improving manufacturing processes , shortening the time it takes to cure the blades , and making other improvements , researchers hope to reduce the blade costs by as much as 25 % . sandia is also working with industry and academia to improve blade-manufacturing processes for fiberglass and plastic blades . rotor speed ( variable ) : 11 - 34 rpm swept area : 20,000 - 50,000 square feet per turbine ( 65,840 - 164,600 square meters ) . gearbox type : integrated 2 stage with parallel shafts , or three-step planetary spur gear system . generator type : rotary current asynchronous . custom generators promise better performance today , most wind turbines use constant-speed generators to make electricity from the rotational energy produced when the wind turns the turbine rotor . these standard generators are widely available from industry . they are affordable but require costly transmissions and gears to operate . the gears increase the speed of the turbine rotor , which is 60 revolutions per minute ( rpm ) or less , to 1,800 rpm , the rotational speed required to operate a typical `` off the shelf '' generator . the development of generators that work at low rotational speeds holds promise for better performance at lower cost . because some generators can operate at the same rotational speeds as the turbine rotor , the expensive gearbox can be eliminated . designing the generators is a major technical challenge , however . to work , low-speed generators require custom-made , high-efficiency , solid-state electronic converters , called power electronic converters , to generate 60-cycle alternating current and allow the generator to operate at variable speeds . nrel researchers believe custom-made , low-speed generators with power electronics and variable-speed operation will be able to produce about 10 % more electricity than their constant-speed counterparts . because they can respond to changes in the wind , variable-speed generators can keep the turbine operating at maximum efficiency . plus , they are quieter and reduce wear and tear on the turbine . in a constant-speed machine , rotor speed must be held steady and can not increase once the turbine is producing maximum power . in a variable-speed machine , the rotor can spin faster in response to increases in wind speed , thereby using more of the power in the wind to generate electricity . variable-speed generators should work well with both standard , three-bladed machines and two-bladed , flexible turbines . designing custom generators and power electronics that both work efficiently at low wind speeds is essential , however . otherwise , poor performance at low wind speeds will offset some of the gains in efficiency at higher wind speeds . inverter type : igbt-frequency inverter . braking systems : individual pitch regulation brake control system : fail-safe . yaw system : motor driven with wind direction sensor and automatic cable unwind . control system : 32 bit microprocessor-based , embedded micro-controller , remote control operating system ; microprocessor-based programmable logic controller ( plc ) ; or equivalent . control systems improve plant efficiency computerized control systems can also help wind power plants run more efficiently . nrel 's partner second wind inc. < http : //www.secondwind.com > developed a sophisticated wind power plant control system . the system can monitor each turbine 's power output as well as current wind conditions . power plant operators can use this information to adjust the operation of individual turbines to maximize power output or minimize wear and tear on the machine . a supervisory computer also allows operators to see the entire power plant at one time by displaying a map of the turbines , meteorological towers , and substations . doe is using second wind 's power plant control system to monitor turbine performance in new projects being developed under the wind turbine verification program . < weu.html > lightning protection system : lightning protection installed on blade tips , discharge inside the rotor blades along nacelle and tower . sound

abstract the basic principle of wind turbine converting wind energy into electricity comes from the lift produced by the air flowing through the rotor . the shape of rotor blade plays an important role in determining the overall aerodynamic performance of a horizontal axis wind turbine . in this work , blade is designed for a 5kw horizontal axis wind turbine which is already in market . for designing blade , blade element momentum theory ( bemt ) is used and a computer program is developed to automate the complete procedure . two naca airfoils are taken for the comparative calculation of elemental power coefficient and other parameters such as chord , thickness and twist distribution . the airfoil taken for designing the blade is same from root to tip . stresses are maximum at the blade root . in this work , the blade root is thickest portion of the blade and twist is maintained such that the angle of attack will be maximum at every station of the blade . in the designed blade , the elemental power coefficient is maximum in transition segment . the present method is useful for predicting the performance of wind turbine blade . keywords : power coefficient , twist , chord , airfoil , design . 1. introduction the power efficiency of wind energy systems has a high impact in the economic analysis of this kind of renewable energies . the efficiency in these systems depends on many subsystems : blades , gearbox , electric generator and control . some factors involved in blade efficiency are the wind features , like its probabilistic distribution , the mechanical interaction of blade with the electric generator , and the strategies dealing with pitch and rotational speed control . it is a complex problem involving many factors , relations and constraints . the increasing awareness of the general public to climate change and global warming has provided opportunities for wind turbine applications in the uk . the uk claims 40 % of the wind energy resources of europe . study of ackermann , ( 2002 ) shows europe leads the world with 70.3 % ( 23gw peak ) of the total operational wind power capacity world wide . as well as large wind turbines operating in open areas on- and off-shore , more small-scale wind turbines are being installed and operated by homeowners and small enterprises . one of the differences between large- and small-scale wind turbines is that small-scale wind turbines are generally located where the power is required , often within a built environment , rather than where the wind is most favorable . in such location , the wind is normally weak , turbulent and unstable in terms of direction and speed , because of the presence of buildings and other adjacent obstructions . to yield a reasonable power output from a small-scale wind turbine located in this turbulent environment , and to justify such an installation economically , the turbines have to improve their energy capture , particularly at low wind speeds and be responsive to changes in wind direction . this means that small-scale turbines need to be specifically designed to work effectively in low and turbulent wind resource areas . according to spera , ( 1994 ) the glauert and wilson methods were mostly used for blade design . the objectives of these methods were to obtain the maximum power coefficient of each blade section at the design wind speed . because the time variation characteristics of wind speed are not taken into account , blades designed by these methods can not achieve the maximum annual energy output . furthermore , design results from these methods must be substantially amended to get smooth chord length and twist

distributions . because the amended results already deviate from the design points , effectively controlling design results pose problems . a resent study by maalawi et al , ( 2001 ) has indicated that the theoretical optimum distribution of the inflow angle can be adequately determined from an exact trigonometric function method , which is based on glauert ’ s , ( 1935 ) optimum condition . the developed approach eliminated much of the numerical efforts as required by the other iterative procedures , and a unique relation in the angle of attack was developed , ensuing convergence of the attained solutions . a prototype 3 kw horizontal upwind type wind turbine generator of 4 m in diameter has been designed by nagai et al . ( 2009 ) and examined under real wind conditions . the machine was designed based on the concept that even small wind turbines should have a variable pitch control system just as large wind turbines , especially in japan where typhoons occur at least once a year . a characteristic of the machine is the use of a worm and gear system with a stepping motor installed in the center of the hub , and the rotational main shaft . the machine is constructed with no mechanical breaking system so as to avoid damage from strong wind . in a storm , the wind turbine is slowed down by adjusting the pitch angle and the maximum electrical load . usually , the machine is controlled at several stages depending on the rotational speed of the blades . two control methods have been applied : the variable pitch angle , and regulation of the generator field current . the characteristics of the generator under each rotational speed and field current are first investigated in the laboratory . this paper describes the performances of the wind turbine in terms of the functions of wind turbine rotational speed , generated outputs , and its stability for wind speed changes . the expected performances of the machine have been confirmed under real wind conditions and compared with numerical simulation results . the wind turbine showed a power coefficient of 0.257 under the average wind speed of 7.3 m/s . an optimization model presented by liu et al . ( 2007 ) for horizontal axis wind turbine . the model refers to the wind speed distribution function on the specific wind site , with an objective to satisfy the maximum annual energy output . to speedup the research process and guarantee a global optimal result , the extended compact genetic algorithm ( ecga ) is used to carry out the search process . compared with simple genetic algorithm , ecga runs much faster and can get more accurate results with a much smaller population size and fewer function evaluations . using the developed optimization program , blades of 1.3 mw stall regulated wind turbine are designed . compared with the existing blades , the designed blades have obviously better aerodynamic performance . the design and selection procedure of airfoil sections for small wind turbine blades is discussed and implemented by habali , ( 1995 ) . it is found that for blades up to 5 m. long , two different airfoils mixed at the outer third of the span will be sufficient and have demonstrated good strength and aerodynamic characteristics . a mathematical model for fluid dynamics wind turbine design by lanzafame et al . , ( 2007 ) ( based on blade element momentum theory ) has been implemented and improved . the mathematical simulations have been compared with experimental data found in literature . the simulation was performed for the whole wind velocity range , in on-design and off-design conditions . several simulations were performed in order to maximize the agreement between the simulated and experimental data . particular attention was paid to the tangential induction factor and to the models for the representation of the lift and drag coefficients . several researchers have contributed to the insight into rotor design . snel ( 1998 , 2003 ) describe wind turbine aerodynamics in general and gives an overview of the available methods to compute the aerodynamic rotor performance . fuglsang , ( 2002 ) describes the methods needed in the rotor design process in terms of a guideline and tangler , ( 2000 ) gives a short historical overview of the rotor design investigations . also , aerodynamic optimization of rotors is described by fuglsang , ( 1999 ) giguere , ( 2000 ) nygaard , ( 1999 ) respectively . details in rotor design to increase the power efficiency have been investigated by several researchers ; johansen and madsen ( 2007 ) investigated especially the root part of rotors and found that a new root design of the rotors did not increase the power performance significantly . however , the interaction between different parameters in the rotor design , such as tip- speed-ratio , reynolds number etc . still needs to be investigated simultaneously when addressing design of rotors with maximum power performance . this paper focuses on performance investigation of wind turbine blade for a 5kw hawt . this work is carried out on a commercial available wind turbine manufactured by qingdao sea.silkroad int'l co.ltd . all through this work , the lift coefficient is taken as 1.1 which is constant throughout the blade . the lift and drag coefficients are taken from abbott , ( 1958 ) . these values are taken for reynolds number 3 x 106. under this investigation , two airfoils are taken , namely , the four digits and the five digit airfoil . the blade is divided into ten elements and power coefficient is calculated for each element with the help of a computer program . chord and thickness of the blade is maximum at the root because of stresses and the twist is maximum near the root . figure 1 shows the complete process of the work . 2. specification and airfoil properties 2.1 specifications table 1 : the specification of wind turbine taken , are made by qingdao sea.silkroad int'l co.ltd . the capacity of this turbine is 5kw . model hy-5kw rated power ( kw ) 5 maximum power ( kw ) 5.4

2.2 airfoil properties in this work , two airfoils are taken , one of them is four digit and the other is five digit airfoil . theory of wing section by abbott , ( 1958 ) is used for taking the properties of airfoils . the selection of airfoil is very important point in designing an efficient rotor . grifith , ( 1977 ) showed that the output power is greatly affected by the airfoil lift-to-drag ratio , while hassanein , ( 2000 ) recommended that the airfoil be selected according to its location along the blade to ensure its highest contribution to the overall performance . the numbering system for naca wing sections of the four-digit series is based on the section geometry . the first integer indicates the maximum value of the mean-line ordinate yc in per cent of the chord . the second integer indicates the distance from the leading edge to the location of the maximum camber in tenths of the chord . the last two integers indicate the section thickness in per cent of the chord . thus the naca 4412 wing section has 4 per cent camber at 0.4 of the chord from the leading edge and is 12 per cent thick . the numbering system for wing sections of the naca five-digit ( 643-218 ) series is based on a combination of theoretical aerodynamic characteristics and geometric characteristics . the first integer indicates the amount of camber in terms of the relative magnitude of the design lift coefficient ; the design lift coefficient in tenths is thus three-halves of the first integer . the second and third integers together indicate the distance from the leading edge to the location of the maximum camber ; this distance in per cent of the chord is one-half the number represented by these integers . the last two integers indicate the section thickness in per cent of the chord . 3. the blade element – momentum ( bem ) theory the basic assumption in blade element momentum theory is that the force of the blade element is solely responsible for the change of momentum in the air which passes through the annulus swept by the blade element . it is therefore to be assumed that there is no radial interaction between the flows through contiguous annuli – a condition that is strictly only true if the axial flow induction factor does not vary radially . in practice , the axial flow induction factor is seldom uniform but experimental examination of flow through propeller disk by lock ( 1924 ) shows that the assumption of the radial independence is acceptable . the component of aerodynamic force on n blade elements resolved in the axial direction is

δ l cos φ + δ d sin φ =

1 ρ w 2 nc ( cl cos φ + cd sin φ ) δ r 2

( 1 )

the rate of change of axial momentum of the air passing through the swept annulus is

ρ v0 ( 1 − a ) 2π rδ r 2av0 = 4πρ v02 a ( 1 − a ) rδ r
the drop in wake pressure caused by wake rotation is equal to the increase in dynamic head , which is

( 2 )

1 ρ ( 2a , ωr ) 2 2
therefore , the additional axial force on the annulus is

1 ρ ( 2a ' ωr ) 2 2π rδ r 2
thus ,

1 ρ w 2 nc ( cl cos φ + cd sin φ ) δ r = 4πρ [ v02 a ( 1 − a ) + ( a ' ωr ) 2 ] rδ r 2
simplifying ,

w2 c n ( cl cos φ + cd sin φ ) = 8π ( a ( 1 − a ) + ( a ' λμ ) 2 ) μ 2 v0 r
the element of axial rotor torque caused by aerodynamic forces on the blade elements is

( δ l sin φ − δ d cos φ ) r =

the rate of change of angular momentum of the air passing through the annulus is

equating the two moments

solving eqns . ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) to obtain values for the flow induction factors a and a ' using two-dimensional aerofoil characteristics requires an iterative process . the following equations , derived from eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) , are convenient in which the right-hand sides are evaluated using existing values of the flow induction factors yielding simple equations for the next iteration of the flow induction factors .

σ is defined as total blade area divided by the rotor disc area and is a primary parameter in determining rotor performance . chord solidity σ r is defined as the total blade chord length at a given radius divided by the circumferential length at
blade solidity that radius .

it is argued by wilson and lissaman ( 1974 ) that the drag coefficient should not be included in eqs . ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) because the velocity deficit caused by drag is confined to the narrow wake which flows from the trailing edge of the aerofoil . furthermore , wilson and lissaman reason , the drag-based velocity deficit is only a feature of the wake and does not contribute to the velocity deficit upstream of the rotor disc . the basis of the argument for excluding drag in the determination of the flow induction factors is that , for attached flow , drag is caused only by skin friction and does not affect the pressure drop across the rotor . clearly , in stalled flow the drag is overwhelmingly caused by pressure . in attached flow it has been shown by young and squire ( 1938 ) that the modification to the inviscid pressure distribution around an aerofoil caused by the boundary layer has an affect both on lift and drag . the ratio of pressure drag to total drag at zero angle of attack is approximately the same as the thickness to chord ratio of the aerofoil and increases as the angle of attack increases . one last point about the bem theory : the theory is strictly only applicable if the blades have uniform circulation , i.e . , if a is uniform . for non-uniform circulation there is a radial interaction and exchange of momentum between flows through adjacent elemental annular rings . it can not be stated that the only axial force acting on the flow through a given annular ring is that due to the pressure drop across the disc . however , in practice , it appears that the error involved in relaxing the above constraint is small for tip speed ratios greater than 3. the complete procedure can be written as : ( i ) guess a and a ' ( a = a ' = 0 is acceptable to start hau ( 2006 ) ) ; ( ii ) calculate φ form

4.2 twist distribution the twist of a wind turbine blade is defined in terms of the chord line . it is a synonym for the pitch angle . however , the twist defines the pitch settings at each station along the blade according to the local flow conditions . the pitch angle ( β ) is large near the root ( where local speeds are low ) , and small at the tip ( where local speeds are high ) . the apparent wind angle changes along the blade due to the increase in blade speed with increasing distance outboard . hence , to maintain optimum angle of attack of the blade section to the wind , it must be twisted along its length . in this work , the twist distribution is maintained such that the lift

5. conclusion this paper presents the investigation of blade performance for a 5 kw horizontal axis wind turbine based on blade element momentum theory . the most difficult issues for the bem theory are : mathematical representation of the correct lift and drag coefficient values and correct evaluation of the axial and tangential induction factors . the blades having constant lift to drag ratio corresponding to all elements are investigated . two naca airfoils are taken in this work ( the four digit one and the five digit one ) . for the selected airfoils and the blade number , the chord , thickness and twist decrease as we move from root to tip . at the blade root , chord and thickness attain their maximum values . twist is maintained in such a manner that the angle of attack gives the maximum lift coefficient . chord distribution is same for both airfoils at all tip speed ratios . twist distribution is different in both airfoils at different tip speed ratios . the value of elemental power coefficient is maximum for elements where r/r varies from 0.3 to 0.6. the nature of the flow pattern around an aerofoil is determined by the reynolds number and this significantly affects the values of the lift and drag coefficients . the power coefficient of a rotor varies with the tip speed ratio ( the ratio of rotor tip speed to free wind speed ) and is only a maximum for a unique tip speed ratio . the maximum power coefficient that can be achieved in the presence of drag is significantly less than the betz limit at all tip speed ratios . drag reduces the power coefficient at high tip speed ratios . structural and cfd analysis of the designed blade can also be done . nomenclature

the effect of blade pitch on small multi-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbines the effect of blade pitch on small multi-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbines m. curtis rector and dr. kenneth visser department of mechanical and aeronautical engineering the general goal in optimizing the aerodynamic performance of wind turbines is to increase power extraction with a minimal increase to the overall cost of the system . for this reason , utility scale wind turbines are optimized for least cost , since they are equipped with large , very expensive blades . it is believed , however , that the idea of aerodynamic optimization could play a larger role in the efficiency of small wind turbines , as these extreme costs do not apply on horizontal-axis wind turbines ( hawt ’ s ) more suited for smaller utilities such as home use . the goal of this study is to optimize the performance of small hawt ’ s by examining the effect of blade pitch on turbines with more than three blades . the optimization of a wind turbine ’ s aerodynamic performance relies on many factors and variables , including blade number ( b ) ; rotor solidity ( σ ) , the ratio of blade area to swept area ; blade pitch ( β ) , the angle between the chord line and the plane of rotation ; and tip speed ratio ( λ ) , the ratio of peripheral tip speed to wind speed . aerodynamic performance of small hawt ’ s has been an active research topic at clarkson over the past few years . initial numerical studies investigated the implications of solidity and blade number and have since been tested experimentally in the clarkson wind tunnel and at a full-scale level at the clarkson university wind turbine test site , located at the potsdam airport . the full scale experiment , comparing a standard three-blade bergey xl.1 with an experimental prototype six-blade turbine , shows an increase in power extraction at lower wind speeds for increased blade number and solidity . the prototype has also shown that its greater torque results in lowered operational tip speed ratio , a decreased tip speed ratio at maximum power coefficient ( cp ) , the ratio of extracted power to the power in the wind , and reduced cut-in wind speeds . the impact of blade pitch angle is a critical parameter for the aerodynamic optimization of untwisted blades . the numerical studies performed earlier for multi-bladed turbines include this parameter , as well , indicating a turbine with a 10° blade pitch angle resulting in a 20 % greater cp than one at 20° . they also suggest an increased tip speed ratio at maximum cp for a reduced blade pitch angle , greatly affecting the tip speed ratio range of operation . this thesis examines the effect of blade pitch on a six-bladed turbine in an effort to optimize its aerodynamic performance so as to extract the greatest power and energy production for given wind conditions . since this thesis is intended to complement the full-scale research regarding small hawt ’ s , data is being acquired at the clarkson university wind turbine test site . the site includes a silo , a meteorological tower and two fully operation 1kw wind turbines . a meteorological tower , located approximately 20 meters upwind of the two test turbines , is equipped with three anemometers to measure wind speed at heights of 6 , 12 and 18 meters . pressure , temperature and humidity are measured at 6 meters and corrected to the hub height of both turbines . the first of the two turbines , pictured in figure 1a , is that of an unmodified bergey xl.1 , and is used as the control for the experiment . this 3 bladed , horizontal-axis , upwind style wind turbine has a 6 % solidity , blade diameter of 2.5 m , and estimated blade pitch angle of 10° . it is positioned at a height of 18 m , approximately 5 blade diameters away from the prototype , perpendicular to the prevailing winds . the experimental prototype , pictured in figure 1b , is also a bergey xl.1 , modified to accept multiple blades at various pitch angles . in its current modified state , this turbine is a 6 bladed , horizontal axis , upwind style wind turbine having 12 % solidity and blade diameter of 2.5 m. a hub attachment was designed to enable the 6 blade configuration , which will remain throughout these studies , and variable pitch angles that are manually adjusted through the use of metal shims . all other aspects of the prototype turbine have remained unchanged from the as-bought condition in an effort to maintain uniformity with the control . both turbines have been installed as separate systems , each consisting of identical resistive load banks , length and grade of wire and safety equipment . data from the turbines and meteorological tower is collected every second and stored in a computer housed inside the test silo . the data acquisition system , within , uses two national instruments pci-6024e daq boards with a bnc-2120 interface in conjunction with labview 6.0i . current and voltage transducers located at the resistive load bank are used to determine power , and rpm is calculated from the frequency in the voltage signal . the resistive load bank , replacing what would be a battery charging unit during normal use , allows manual adjustment of the load between 1 and 25 ohms , for a more controlled study . analysis procedures follow the nerl performance test plans for a wind turbine very similar to the bergey xl.1 used on site , along with the test procedures developed by advanced wind turbines incorporated . the acquired data is sorted according to wind speed into bins 0.5 m/s wide , with bin centers located at half-integer multiples . from these averaged bins , power curves are then generated for each resistance value tested . performance curves of power coefficient versus tip speed ratio and total energy are also created to compare and analyze the overall performance of the turbines . the present study is investigating the impact of 10° and 20° blade pitch angles , as data has previously been obtained for a 15° pitch angle . since resistive loads directly impact the power output of the wind turbines , resistances ranging between 1 and 8 ohms were tested to represent a range of high-to-low load conditions . as can be seen in figure 2 , the prototype having greater torque is able to operate at a higher load for a given wind speed , so a comparison of identical loads does not reflect optimum conditions for either turbine . figure 2 compares the 2 ohm and 6 ohm cases for a 15° blade pitch angle . as the load increases from 6 ohms to 2 ohms , the rotor speed decreases on the control , closing the difference in energy extraction between the two turbines . figure 3 displays the overall power curve for each turbine , representing the optimum power output at a given wind speed . the results show the prototype turbine able to produce a greater power output than the control at lower wind speeds , under 3.5 m/s , while the reverse is true for wind speeds greater than 3.5 m/s . the energy extraction of each turbine for a given month , june 2004 , is illustrated in figure 4. the improved power of the prototype at low wind speeds results in a greater extraction of energy than the control turbine at these speeds . although it is not clearly evident from the figure , the wind speeds averaged 3.5 m/s and below for more than 60 % of the month . comparing the total energy extraction for the given month , the as-bought bergey xl.1 produced 9.7 kw·hr more than the prototype . class of 2005 , mechanical engineering , clarkson

summary
the theoretical development of a method of analysis for prediction of the aerodynamic performance of horizontal axis wind turbines is presented in this report . the method is based on the assumption that a helical vortex emanates collectively these vortices form a vortex system velocities induced by

from each blade element .

that extends infinitely far downstream of the blade .

this vortex system are found by applying the biot-savart law . accordingly , this method avoids the use of any interference factors which are used in many of the momentum theories . what 's more , the method can be used to predict the

performance of wind turbines with a small number of blades . the wind turbine performance of a two-bladed rotor is determined and compared to existing experimental data and to corresponding values computed from the widely used prop code . it was found that the present method com-

pared favorably with experimental data especially for low wind velocities . the wind turbine performance of a single-bladed rotor is determined subject to the condition that there was no lift on the counterweight or support span . output power for a one-bladed wind turbine was compared to

that of a two-bladed machine .

introduction over the past few years , interest in the use of windmills to produce power

has grown significantly .

in support of this interest , considerable research

has been directed toward the measurement and prediction of wind turbine performance . the majority of the theoretical effort employed thus far is

based on a variety of methods that have long been used in the calculation of propeller performance ; classical momentum theory along with a number of bladeelement theories have been utilized with varying degrees of success . a computer code developed by wilson and walker at oregon state university , [ 1 ] , and entitled prop , is at present widely used to determine the aerodynamic performance of horizontal axis wind turbines . this code was developed several years ago as a general purpose wind turbine performance computer program . flexibility . accordingly , prop has a certain amount of built-in

for example , the code contains four blade tip-loss models

( nasa , prandtl , goldstein , and no tip-loss ) which can be incorporated into the performance prediction ; however , the choice of which model to use is left to the user 's discretion . the prop code is based on a modified blade element analysis called the glauert vortex theory [ 1 ] . an essential assumption of this theory is that

vortices originate from the rotating blades to form a helical vortex system that passes downstream . of fundamental importance , this trailing vortex

system induces velocities which alter the flow around the blades and in turn affect the forces acting on the blades . it should be noted that because of

the complexity involved the induced velocities are not determined directly in the glauert vortex theory . instead , axial and radial interference factors are

calculated from which the induced velocity of the vortex system on any blade element can be evaluated . the calculation of these interference factors is

3

simplified by assuming that the rotor has an infinite number of blades . this assumption removes the complexity associated with the periodicity of the
,

blade flow and permits direct application of momentum theory for the evaluation of the interference velocities . however , for single and double-bladed

rotors , of principal interest here , this assumption is questionable . users of the prop code have frequently encountered problems with the convergence of the numerical procedure in the program . it has been found

that under certain operating conditions of a wind turbine , particularly those for large tip speed ratios ( generally small wind velocities ) , the local value of the axial interference factor can exceed a theoretically limiting value for all tip-loss models . when the axial interference factor lies in the range 1/2 state .

1 , this state is known as a turbulence wake or vortex ring

under such a condition , the velocity in the fully developed wake therefore , the

will then reverse direction and flow back toward the rotor .

momentum-blade element theory ceases to be valid , and it is then necessary to modify the analysis by using glauert 's empirical data . these empirical corrections have been developed for the momentum-blade element theory and discussed in some detail in [ 2,3j , however , theoretical performance estimations in the region are suspect even when corrected by empirical methods . experience has also revealed from comparison of prop code predictions with experimental data that for all blade tip-loss models , prop results tend to underestimate measured power output both near `` cut-in '' and rated wind speeds . because of the inherent limitations with the momentum-blade element theory and because of the need to develop an analytical method for predicting the aerodynamic performance of wind turbines with a small number of blades , it was decided that a different and more complete method of anlysis was in

4

order .

the purpose of this report is to describe the development of the

method which is termed a vortex wake model . in the analysis , the induced velocity is directly calculated by integration of the biot-savart law under the assumption that a filament of the trailing vortices is helical in form , extends infinitely downstream of the rotor , and has a constant diameter . it is also assumed that the helical

vortex system produced at the blade is traveling downstream with a constant velocity . this velocity is equal to the value at the rotor blade , i.e . , the inflow velocity through rotor 's plane of rotation . interactions between wake elements are ignored . used to model the blades . an analysis and a computer program for predicting the aerodynamic performance of a horizontal wind turbine by using a vortex wake method has also been developed by r. h. miller , et al [ 3 ] . the difference between that this implies that the

ihe lifting line theory is

analysis and the present one is in the modeling of the circulation around the blade and in the vortex wake and in the method of integrating the biot-savart law to evaluate local induced velocities . blade is modeled as a step function . in [ 3 ] , the bound circulation for

this means that each blade is divided

into a number of spanwise sections , which are , in general , of unequal length . each blade section is then represented by a bound line vortex of constant strength . since jump discontinuties exist in circulation between adjacent

spanwise blade sections , a trailing line vortex must be generated at each of these points . these helical vortices are further approximated by a series of straight line vortex segments , each spanning an angle of 10° or 15° over which integration is performed . in the current analysis , a continuous vari-

ation of circulation in the spanwise direction is used and the integration is

5

performed for the whole helical vortex sheet in the trailing wake to evaluate the local induced velocities .

,

the method developed was found to be very flexible and is capable of accurately predicting `` cut-in '' speeds and wind turbine output power . the

method can handle rotors having any number of blades and the blades may be arbitrarily shaped and twisted . however , this study will concentrate on one

and two-bladed rotors with blade geometry appropriate to nasa wind turbines
[ 4,5j .

it should also be mentioned that , although the analysis presented in the report is limited to steady uniform flow , the technique can be readily extended to non-steady wind with shear flow and to the case of an expanding wake . because the method proposed herein is based on a propeller model and because prop also is based on a number of propeller models , it was felt that a brief review of some propeller theories as applied to wind turbines was appropriate . hence , momentum theory , blade element theory and vortex theory

will all be briefly discussed in appendix a. in the following , the present method , which is based on the vortex theory of propellers along with moriya 's theory [ 6j , will be described . discussion

will be given as to how moriya 's theory may be implemented in determining wind turbine performance . results of a number of calculations will be comfinally , the method will be used to

pared with existing experimental data .

analysis

2.1 introduction to vortex theory from ideal flow theory it may be recalled that vorticity is defined as twice the angular velocity of an element of fluid . a region containing a

concentrated amount of vorticity is called a vortex and a vortex is said to have a strength equal to the circulation around the vortex area . helmholtz

theorems [ 7 ] are a set of propositions that apply to vortices and vortex mechanics . one theorem states that in an inviscid flow within which the

forces are conservative and the pressure is only a function of density , rotation of fluid particles , which travel along stream lines , is permanent . from this theorem , often referred to as the vortex continuity theorem , it becomes evident that a vortex filament can not end abruptly , and , unless the filament forms a closed path , it must extend either to infinity or to the boundaries of the fluid . associated with a vortex filament is a velocity

field that the filament generates . this velocity is commonly referred to as the induced velocity . the induced velocity can be calculated from the biot-savart law [ 8 ] as

where dwi

is the induced velocity due to a vortex element , of length ds
+
r

and strength y , and r is the position vector from the point at which the induced velocity is being calculated to the element of the vortex . 2.2 vortex theory of propellers the vortex theory of propellers is based on the concept that each element of the blade can be treated as a two-dimensional airfoil section

11

subject to a certain local resultant velocity wand that the local lift of the blade element , dl , is associated with the circulation r around the contour of the airfoil . the local resultant velocity is found from the

vector sum of the free stream velocity , the circumferential velocity of the section and the induced flow velocity . the kutta-joukowski theorem [ 9 ] , for each blade element , may be written dl = prwdr where p is the local density of the air and dr is the elemental blade length . in general , the circulation r around a blade will vary along the dr blade span . as the circulation changes by the amount -- - dr between the dr paints rand r + dr along the blade length , it follows , from the vortex
( 2-2 )

continuity principle , that a trailing vortex filament of the same strength emanates from the blade element and extends infinitely far downstream of the blade . because trailing vortices emanate from every point along the rotating

blade , they form a vortex sheet of approximately helical shape . the number of such sheets is equal to the number of blades . due to the trailing vortex sheets there is an induced velocity distribution , wi , in the plane of rotor . this induced velocity can be used to obtain the local resultant velocity w that may in turn be used in the kutta-joukowski theorem to determine the lift on a blade element .
2.3

general assumptions the principle assumptions on which the present analysis of the

aerodynamic performance of a horizontal axis wind turbine is based may be stated as follows : 1 ) that the air flow is incompressible and inviscid ,

12 2 ) that the free stream velocity is always parallel to the rotor shaft centerline and uniform along the span , 3 ) that the relative velocity of a blade element to the airstream is identical to the velocity that the blade element would have were it placed in a two-dimensional stream with an identical relative velocity , 4 ) that the trailing vortex system is helicoidal with constant pitch and diameter , extending infinitely far downstream of the blade , and moving with a constant velocity determined at the rotor ( semi-rigid wake ) , and 5 ) that the hub has no effect on the rotor flow . unlike other vortex theories e.g . , goldstein [ 10 ] and theodorson [ 11 ] theories , the present method of analysis , which will be termed the helical vortex method , does not restrict the circulation along the blade to that of an optimum distribution corresponding to a rigid helical vortex system moving backward from the blade with constant velocity . however , like other vortex

methods , the current method does assume that slipstream expansion is of secondary importance and thus may be neglected . slipstream expansion is due

to the gradual decrease of axial velocity behind the rotor which is caused by the decrease in pressure behind the rotor . the decrease in air pressure

behind a wind turbine and the increase in air pressure immediately in front of rotor is a direct reaction of the axial force on the wind turbine . it

should be noted that the first , second and third assumptions in the preceding list of assumptions are identical to those used in goldstein and theoderson theories . further , no hub is permissible in either of these theories ; all

integrations must begin at the origin and not at the hub radius .

13

the physical arrangement of the problem at hand is illustrated in fig . 2-1. the coordinate systems for the analysis are shown in fig . 2-2. the

cartesian coordinates x , v , and z are fixed in a space and were chosen such that the x-v axes form a plane of rotation and the z-axis is the axis of rotation . moreover , the z coordinate is the distance measured from the rotor

to a segment of trailing vortex parallel to the axis of rotation of the rotor . the second coordinate system used is a cylindrical coordinate system ( r , e , z ) which is fixed to the rotating blade . the r-axis is directed along the blade span , the e-axis measures the azimuthal angle measured from the kth blade and the z-axis is the axis of rotation . to facilitate the analysis , the blade whose induced velocity is to be calculated , is assumed to be coincident with the x-axis as shown in fig . 2-2 .
2.4 calculation of induced velocity

as has been mentioned , it is assumed that the vortex filament trailing from a blade element extends infinitely far downstream of the rotor . associated with this vortex is a velocity field , commonly referred to as the induced velocity . this velocity field can be calculated from the biot-savart law [ 8 ] i.e . , equation ( 2-1 ) . this law is stated in vector differential form as

13

in this equation , dwi is the differential velocity induced at a point r ' on the blade due to a segment , dn , of the trailing vortex filament which had dr originated at a point r on the kth blade . also dr , or -- dr , is the change in dr

it can be seen that difficulty arises when the integral in equation ( 2-41 ) ; s evaluated at the point

= ~i when e = ek = o. in this case , the integral

becomes infinitely large , and because of this singularity , the integral in equation ( 2-39 ) can not be accurately determined in the neighborhood of this particular point . however , the problem can be resolved by applying moriya 's

theory [ 6 ] which is qescribed in the next section .

25 2.5 application of moriya 's theory moriya [ 6j has developed a simple method for determining the downwash velocity . this was accomplished by introducing an additional parameter to the analysis . this factor is defined as the ratio of the induced velocity , due to a helical vortex , to the induced velocity , due to a straight vortex , of the same strength i.e . ,

i =-

( 2-42 )

where dwn and dwnl are induced velocities created by helical and straight vortices respectively . the factor i is appropriately termed an induction factor and may be considered to be a continuous function . induced velocity at point rl of the blade due to a helical vortex sheet emanating from point r of the blade can be obtained from equation ( 2-39 ) . the velocity induced at point rl of the blade due to a straight vortex sheet emanating from point r of the blade and extending infinitely far downstream of the blade can be obtained by applying the biot-savart law . the following apply for a straight vortex line

it should be pointed out that the integral in the above equation becomes infinitely large as

the second integral on right hand side of equation ( 2-70 ) , still contains the singularity ; however , it may be given an approximate treatment as follows . over all blades . the induction factor in equation ( 2-50 ) is summed

thus , the factor may be written ( 2-72 ) considering the

38 3.1 double-bladed , naca 23024 airfoil wind turbine calculations in this section , the power output of a double-bladed rotor wind turbine will be presented for four pitch angles and two different rotational speeds . the blade profile used in all calculations is an naca 23024 airfoil . this

particular blade section was chosen because it is the blade section used in the early nasa , large , wind turbines . displayed in table i. pertinent blade information is

the dimensions of the blade are given in fig . 3-1 ,

and the aerodynamic blade data , i.e . , the lift and drag coefficient curves , are shown in figs . 3-2 and 3-3. these curves were taken from [ 12 ] .

further , because portions of the wind turbine blades may operate in the `` stalled region , '' which occur at blade angles of attack approximately 13° and larger , the airfoil data had to be supplemented with additional information . this high angle of attack information was taken from [ 1 ] . it will be shown

later in this section that better understanding of this operating region is urgently needed if improvements in performance prediction are to be realized . it should also be mentioned that surface roughness has been accounted for in figs . 3-2 and 3-3 , and that the curves correspond to a `` haif rough '' ( average between rough and smooth curves ) values . the reynolds number is that calculated at the mid span of the blade , hence , no account of the reynolds number variation along the blade is included . subsequent evaluations can ,

however , easily account for both blade surface roughness and reynolds number effects simply by including this data as part of the computer input . at the

present time , these effects were considered secondary and therefore no effort was expended to implement them in the computer program . circulation distribution along the blade must first be determined in order to calculate wind turbine performance . this involves evaluation of the

assumed series for the circulation as described in the previous section .

39 a sample of the variation of this parameter against non-dimensional radius is plotted in fig . 3-4 for the operating conditions specified . figure 3-5 was constructed in order to compare predicted wind turbine power output to existing experimental data . the experimental data was taken predicted power

from nasa mod-o test results described in [ 4j , [ 5j and [ 12j .

output values were computed for a blade fixed at a pitch angle of 0° . experimental output data were obtained for a blade pitch angle of 0° for wind speeds below 18 mph ; at wind speeds larger than 18 mph , the blades were pitched in order to maintain the rated power level of the machine . it should be mentioned that the power output in fig . 3-5 is not rotor power . instead , an empirical relation , taken from [ 5j , relating the rotor this relationship accounts for

power to the alternator power has been used .

the losses in the power transmission ( gearing , friction , etc . ) and , of course , is not applicable to all wind turbine installations . the relation is given by where pg pr pg = 0.95 ( pr - 0.075pe ) ( 3-1 )

= generated

electrical power , kw

= power produced by the rotor , kw pe = rated electrical power , kw
from fig . 3-5 , it can bee seen that in general there is excellent agreement between predicted and mean values of output power . furthermore , the

present method predicts a `` cut-in '' wind speed of 8 mph which agrees very well with the actual value reported in [ 4j . figure 3-6 was drawn so as to compare predicted alternator power values of the present method to corresponding values found by using the prop computer code . as may be seen , four models of the prop code have been used : the

prandtl model , the goldstein model , the no-tip-loss model and the nasa model . the theoretical background for both the prandtl and goldstein models is

briefly treated in appendix a ; the no-tip-loss model is self descriptive as it does not account for any blade end effects ; the nasa model exploits the simplicity of the no-tip-loss model by accounting for blade end effects solely by a reduction ( 31 . ) of the blade radius -- this method is also called the effective radius model . reference to fig . 3-6 shows that results determined by the present method are anywhere from 10 to 15 % higher than those predicted by the prop code for wind speeds ranging from 8 to 20 mph . these results when combined with those of fig . 3-5 reveal that prop code methods underestimate the power output of wind turbines in the wind speed range of interest : `` cut-in '' to rated .

comparison of prop predictions with experimental data was also performed in [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] . it was found that the prop code methods underpredicted power clearly , these findings are

output and overpredicted `` cut-in '' wind speeds . in total agreement with the current findings .

when existing experimental data for blade pitch angles other than 0° were compared to predicted results from both current and prop models , it was found that agreement is not as good as that displayed in fig . 3-5. at present ,

questions have been raised as to the reliability of the experimental data [ 13 ] . thus , those comparisons will not be shown . however , it was believed

that comparison between prop prediction and cury'ent method calculations for different blade pitch angles may be of some value . this comparison is

presented in the form of tables ii , iii and iv where computed power output in kw is shown against wind speeds for the five methods of prediction at blade angles of _1° , +1° and +3° respectively . it must also be noted that the power

values presented aloe rotor power values i.e . , they have not been corrected by using equation ( 3-1 ) . moreover , the data are presented in tabular form

because of the difficulty in graphing results that are relatively close together over various portions of the wind spectrum .

effective angle of attack , ne , occur for negatively pitched wind turbine blades and that the smallest q occurs at positive pitch angles . to obtain an e idea as to how the effective angle of attack is distributed along the blade , as calculated by the present method , qe was plotted for five locations along the blade ( 3/8 span , 1/2 span , 5/8 span , 3/4 span and 7/8 span ) against wind velocity in figs . 3-8 to 3-11. pitch angle . each figure corresponds to a particular blade

reference to the four ' figures reveals that at any blade

location , q increases as the wind velocity increases and that the increase is e practically linear . moreover , it can be seen by comparison that at a given blade location and wind speed , qe decreases as the pitch angle is changed from _1° to +3° . thus , blades with negative pitch angles are `` stalled '' at lower wind velocities than are positively pitched blades . unfortunately the nature of this stall condition on rotating blades is not well understood at present . in particular , the effects of the centrifugal

force on the boundary layer near the tip of the blade may , in fact , delay the presence of stall . it should be noted that the stall condition could be

avoided , in the operating wind speed range of the wind turbine , by appropriately twisting the blade along its span . blade twist angles may be found by

applying the computational scheme developed in the preceding section . 3.2 single-bladed wind turbine calculations currently a large 5mw horizontal axis wind turbine is being designed for use in germany . what makes this work notable is that the machine has only one blade that is balanced by a large counterweight on a stubby arm as

depicted in fig . 3-12 .

it is believed that for very large wind turbines the

use of a single blade reduces capital costs without much reduction in aerodynamic efficiency . to test this premise , the computer program was used to compute the aerodynamic performance of a particular one-bladed machine . in the analyses ,

the counterweight was taken to be 2400 lbs and located at a radial position 25 feet from the turbine rotational axis . support spar are shown in fig . 3-13. the counterweight and cylindrical

calculation of counterweight effect on

the performance was based on the assumptions that there is no circulation around the counterweight or support spar and that the drag coefficients for these parts are 1 and 0.5 respectively . performance of a one-bladed and a two-bladed rotor are compared in figs . 3-14 and 3-15. maximum power . it can be seen that at 22 mph both machines produce their however , the one-bladed machine produces less than half as furthermore , fig . 3-15 reveals that clearly , rotor power of a

much power as the two-bladed machine .

the two-bladed machine is also more efficient .

one-bladed rotor can be increased , as shown in fig . 3-16 , by operating at higher rotational velocity . this , of course , would be accomplished at the cost of higher start-up or `` cut-in '' speed . inspection of figs . 3-14 , 3-15 , and 3-16 reveals that they are not sufficient to decide whether a single-bladed rotor wind turbine is practical or not . the feasibility of this concept strongly depends on the local annual with such wind statistical data , local annual power it should be mentioned that

wind distribution .

output of a one-bladed rotor could be estimated .

the same annual power of a two-bladed wind turbine may be obtained for a one-bladed turbine if diameter of this turbine is appropriately increased .

conclusion in this report , a method for the prediction of wind turbine performance

has been developed .

the equations presented are fairly general :

applicable

to any blade geometry or any airfoil section .

although calculations were

presented for only one and two bladed rotors , the method is applicable to wind turbines having any number of blades . the current method has been programmed on a high speed , digital computer to permit extensive analysis . two-dimensional airfoil data was used as input to the program . this input data can be extended to include variations in reynolds number and blade surface roughness , and therefore , can enable the computer program to better predict the performance of a blade element . further refinement of the computer method may be required to take into account an expanding wake and a non-uniform wind velocity . moreover , a more

suitable function for representing the circulation distribution than that used in this investigation may be warranted . the disadvantage of the fourier

series expansion that was used is that the computing time increases sharply as the number of terms increases . unfortunately , extensive comparison of

predicted wind turbine performance was not possible because of the unavailability of accurate data . such a comparison will be made in the

future , as soon as the data are available , and the results will be reported in volume iii of this report . it was predicted that large losses occur for a one-bladed wind turbine . and , that the peak power of a two-bladed rotor is approximately 50 % higher than that of one-bladed rotor operating at a particular rotational speed . however , by increasing the diameter , the same peak power of a two-bladed turbine may be obtained for a one-bladed turbine and may still be economically competitive with a turbine having more blades .

review of various

r~ethods

of wind turbine

aerodynamic : .-'~erformance

calculatior . ! .

the purpose of this appendix is to briefly present some of the theoretical background for a variety of the methods that have been used to predict the aerodynamic performance of horizontal axis wind turbines . should be mentioned that this review is not comprehensive , for such an undertaking would far exceed the practical limits of this work . the methods which will be described herein are : momentum theory , blade element theory , it

glauert vortex theory , prandtl theory and goldstein theory .

i .

momentum theory in the original , so-called , momentum theory developed by rankine [ 14 ]

and froude [ 15 ] , momentum and energy principles are applied to a simplified model that is based on the following three assumptions : 1 ) the thrust loading is uniformly distributed over the propeller disk ( this implies that there are an infinite number of blades in the disk ) . 2 ) no rotation is imparted to the flow . 3 ) a well-defined slipstream separates the flow passing through the propeller disk from that outside the disk . the momentum theorem is applied to the control volume shown in fig . a-i and it is found that
( a-l )

in this equation , f is the axial force on the wind turbine , m is the flow rate , vo is the freest ream velocity and the v2 is downstream velocity . also , density , area and velocity at the rotor disk are denoted by respectively .

if bp is the discontinuous decrease in the static pressure across the rotor disk , then the axial force on rotor may be expressed as f = abp an expression for bp can be obtained by applying bernoulli 's equation in front of and behind the rotor disk
po + -- - pv

121 = p + -- - pu2 202

subtraction and rearrangement brings bp = 122 p ( v - v ) 202

therefore , the axial force on the wind turbine is f

= abp = -

pa ( v - v ) 202

2

uniting this equation with equation ( a-i ) results in

( a-2 )
thus , the velocity of flow through the disk is the arithmetic average of the upstream and downstream velocities . an axial interference factor , a , is defined as the fractional change in the freest ream velocity that occurs ahead of the disk , i.e . ,
a

=

hence , the velocity of flow through the disk may be written
( a-3 )

69 equating equations ( a-2 ) and ( a-3 ) and rearranging reveals that
a
=

vo - v2 2vo

1 2

-

v2 2vo

( a-4 )

and it may be seen that when the rotor absorbs all the energy of the flow ( v2 = 0 ) , the interference factor will have a value of 1/2 . the power absorbed by the rotor is equal to the mass flow rate times the change in kinetic energy of the incoming fluid , i.e . ,

combining equations ( a-2 ) , ( a-4 ) and ( a-5 ) , yields p

= 2pav a ( l - a ) 2

3 o

( a-6 )

it can be seen that for a given wind speed , rotor size and air density , the power absorbed depends only on the interference factor . hence , maximum power dp is produced when -- - = o. it is easy to show that this condition occurs for da an axial interference value of
1 3 .

thus , from ( a-6 )

( a-7 )

and a power coefficient , defined as
cp
p =-i
( a-b )

has a maximum value of 0.593. if the rotation imparted to flo\'/ is included , in the analysis , the total reduction in translational kinetic energy of the flow is 6k.e .

= power

extracted + rotation k.e .

70

therefore , in order to obtain the maximum power from the stream , it is necessary to keep the rotational kinetic energy as small as possible . moreover , the element of torque is equal to the angular momentum imparted to the blade element in unit time . this equation for a blade element at radial distance r , if ow is the rotational velocity of the air , can be written as dq = 2nr3puowdr an angular interference factor is defined as ( a-io ) where ( a-g )

° is the rotational
dq

velocity of the blade .

introducing equation

( a-io ) into equation ( a-g ) yields

= 4n 3pu a'odr

( a-ii )

using this equation along with the previous theory , allows the incremental axial force , torque and power to be written respectively as df

= 4nrpv

( a-12 ) ( a-13 )

( a-14 ) it should be mentioned that momentum theory provides a good indication of the power coefficient , but fails to furnish the required design data for the rotor blades except for the limiting case of an infinite number of blades .

71

ii .

blade element theory an alternate method of analyzing the behavior of a blade consists

of directly estimating the forces experienced by the blade due to the motion of the air . this method , generally referred to as blade element theory [ 9j ,

is based on the assumption that the aerodynamic force acting on the blade element can be estimated as the force on a suitable airfoil of the same cross-section in an airflow with a uniform velocity wat the same angle of attack . and , that the force on the entire blade can be derived by summing from the velocity and

the contributions of all the elements along the blade .

is the angle between the resultant velocity and free stream velocity .

in addition , the incremental axial force and torque are

73

if the section lift and drag coefficients are known , the axial force and torque can be determined by integrating equations ( a-16 ) and ( a-17 ) along the blade . it should be mentioned that the blade characteristics are those of an

airfoil of the same cross-section in a two-dimensional airflow . the unsatisfactory feature of blade element theory is that it relies on certain airfoil characteristics which vary with aspect ratio and which depend on the interference between the adjacent blades of a rotor . further , this

theory using airfoil data corresponding to a moderate blade aspect ratio , has been found to properly represent observed behavior of a propeller , but fails to provide accurate numerical results [ 9 ] . to improve the accuracy of blade

element theory it has been suggested , [ 9 ] , that the resultant velocity of the blade should be estimated in terms of modified velocities such as those that were determined by the momentum theory . the combined momentum-blade element theory equations are similar to those of the glauert vortex theory , [ 16 ] which will be discussed in the following section .

iii .

glauert vortex theory glauert vortex theory is based on the assumption that trailing

vortices emanate from the trailing edge of rotating blades and form helical vortex sheets that pass downstream . the interference velocity experienced by

the blades is calculated as the induced velocity of this vortex system on any blade element . the calculation of these induced velocities is simplified by assuming that the rotor has an infinite number of blades .

in order to solve equations ( a-2i ) and ( a-22 ) , must first be determined .

and the interference factors

as an aid to this process , it may be assumed that

there is an infinite number of blades , thus , momentum theory equations can be directly applied . in addition , if the rotation in the slipstream is neglected

the following relationship is obtained from ( a-12 ) , ( a-21 ) and ( a-23 )

these equations strictly apply to a rotor with a large number of blades

method of correcting equations ( a-26 ) and ( a-27 ) to account for a rotor with a small number of blades is analogous to that used by prandt1 [ 17 ] . according to that method , the distribution of vortex strength over the blade is related to the shape and motion of the airscrew . the relation of the distribution of vortex strength to the velocity field produced by it has been determined by goldstein [ 10 ] for optimum loading . it should also be mentioned

that the glauert vortex theory does not account for the loss of lift toward the tips of the blades . however , for this theory the concept of an effective

radius may be used to account for this loss .

iv .

prandt1 theory for the optimum circulation condition , the vortex sheet is assumed

to be a rigid helical surface moving backward with constant velocity [ 18 ] . near the boundary of the surface there is flow around the edges of the vortex sheet and thus , the flow acquires an important radial component of velocity . prandt1 approximated the effect of this radial flow by replacing the helical vortex system , shown in fig . a-4 , with a series of parallel lines at a

thus , f ' is a reduction factor which must be applied to the momentum equation for the flow at radius r , since it represents the fact that only a fraction , f ' , of the fluid between successive sheets of the slipstream receives the full effect of these sheets [ 9 ] . applying this correction to the earlier

consisting of a finite number of coaxial helicoids of infinite length , but finite radius , moving through an inviscid fluid with constant velocity . further , the fluid motion is assumed to be irrotational . the results are

applied to the case of an ideal airscrew having a finite number of blades and a particular distribution of circulation along the blade for small values of thrust . goldstein [ 10 ] specifically considered betz 's optimum condition the essential result of goldstein 's

in reference [ 19 ] , it is shown that the velocity of the air relative to free stream velocity between successive sheets at a large distance behind the rotor is normal to the vortex sheets . now , if uz and ue are the axial and

16 abstract

the theoretical development of a method of analysis for prediction of the aerodynamic performance of horizontal axis wind turbines is presented in this report . the method is based on the assumption that a helical vortex emanates from each blade element . collectively these vortices from a vortex system that extends infinitely far downstream of the blade . velocities induced by this vortex system are found by applying the biot-savart law . accordingly , this method avoids the use of any interference factors which are used in many of the momentum theories . what 's more , the method can be used to predict the performance of wind turbines with a small number of blades . the wind turbine performance of a two-bladed rotor is determined and compared to existing experimental data and to corresponding values computed from the widely used prop code . it was found that the present method compared favorably with experimental data especially for low wind veloci- , ties . the wind turbine performance of a single-bladed rotor is determined subject to the condition that there was no lift on the counterweight or support span . output power for a one-bladed wind turbine was compared to that of a two-bladed machine .

1 introduction uvod
considering the fact that the construction of wind power plants is constantly increasing in the republic of croatia , which is understandable regarding the increasing trend of constructing wind power plants in the world , our analysis of the power system operation with the connection of wind power plants requires a presentation of the first two constructed wind power plants in the republic of croatia and their main characteristics . in 2004 , the first wind power plant was installed at the ravne site on the island of pag [ 1 ] . the system consists of seven vestas v52-850kw [ 2 ] wind turbines , which means the total installed power of 5,95 mw . the measurement of the average annual wind speed shows that the wind speed lies between 6 and 6,5 m/s . furthermore , measurements have shown that pag has 1.600 windy ( operation ) hours per year ( from the possible 8.760 hours per year ) . the wind power plant is expected to annually produce 15 gwh . the tower height is 49 m , while the rotor diameter is 52 m ( fig . 1 ) [ 3 ] . in 2006 , the second wind power plant was installed at the trtar-krtolin site near šibenik . 14 wind turbines of the company wpd international gmbh i enersys gesellschaft für regenerative energien mbh [ 4 ] have been installed with the nominal power of 800 kw , i.e . total installed power of 11,2 mw . analysis has shown that trt has about 2.000 windy ( operation ) hours per year . it is important to mention that the electricity generated by both wind power plants is purchased by hep under the agreement made for the next 15 years . after the installation of the two wind power plants , the trend to construct other wind power plants has continued on different locations . it is estimated that currently there are more than 50 wind power plants in the republic of croatia [ 3 ] in different phases of construction .

figure 1 wind power plant ravne on the island of pag slika 1. vjetroelektrana ravne na pagu

2 operation of the wind power plant pogon vjetroelektrane
from the engineering point of view , the most important issue to be solved is how to connect the electricity generated by wind power plants to the existing power system of the republic of croatia . furthermore , the question of output values , i.e . voltage , frequency , active and reactive power has to be solved . therefore , it is necessary to consider the operation of the first wind power plant ravne on the island of pag which consists of 7 vestas v52-850 kw wind turbines [ 1 ] . the wind turbines in question use an asynchronous doubly fed induction generator with variable speed ranging from 0,6 pu to 1,2 pu . bearing in mind that the rotation speed is the key factor for wind power plant operation [ 6 , 7 ] , it is necessary to explain the classification of wind power plants which fall into two groups :

1 ) with constant rotation speed 2 ) with variable rotation speed . the generator in wind power plants with constant rotation speed is directly connected to the power system . the frequency of the system determines the generator rotational speed , and hence the rotor speed . gearbox increases the speed of the shaft thus transforming low rotor rotational speed to high generator rotational speed . the generator speed depends on the number of pole pairs and the network frequency . the generator in wind power plants with variable speed is connected to the network either via an inverter system based on power electronics or via excitation windings fed from the inverter system of the external frequency . the speed of the rotating magnetic field of the generator , and thus the rotor , is separated from the frequency system . the rotor has a variable speed and adapts to wind speed . nowadays , the application of wind power plants having variable speed wind turbines is on the increase , and the size of the wind turbines in question is constantly growing . the main goal of the variable speed wind turbines is to maximize utilization of available wind energy . the variable speed drive can be achieved by using appropriate combinations of generator and power electronic converter .

the wind turbine speed . the bold line connects the power curve relative to optimal operation points with regard to different wind speeds . in low wind-speed conditions , power curve values are monitored in order to determine the maximum energy output of wind turbines . at higher wind speeds , operation limitations regarding mechanical speed , rated torque and system power occur . then , the pitch regulation system is employed to set the generator momentum to nominal value .

figure 2 doubly fed induction generator - dfig slika 2. dvostrano napajani indukcijski generator - dfig

the advantages of asynchronous dfig based wind power plants are as follows : a relatively wide area of change of rotor speed ranging ! from 50 % to 130 % of synchronous speed low power of the semiconductor converter ( up to 30 % ! of the generator nominal power ) total regulation of active and reactive power output of ! the generator . the asynchronous dfig must have contact rings and brushes which represents the main disadvantage of this type of generator [ 8 ] . the electric power of the asynchronous dfig injected into the power system depends on the wind speed which can be seen in fig . 3 for any variable speed wind power plant [ 9 ] . the upper part of the curve lying between the nominal wind speed and wind speed output presented for the asynchronous dfig based wind power plants utilizing variable speed technology , can be maintained linear according to equal amount of nominal generator power . at wind speeds below the rated speed , the pitch control enables us to obtain larger output power compared with the basic type of constant speed wind turbine and constant frequency . moreover , aerodynamic efficiency is optimized through the speed control system for dfig wind turbines by exploiting the highest available power at every wind speed . figure 4 shows the power of dfig which depends on

the wind power plant can operate at four different types of wind speed changes : 1 ) linear change of wind speed 2 ) noise change of wind speed 3 ) gust change of wind speed 4 ) continuous change of wind speed . this is presented in the following sections [ 9 ] .

2.1 linear change of wind speed linearna promjena brzine vjetra

power qg control systems are applied . reactive power regulation of generator stator is carried out by controlling the power factor between 0,98 cap and 0,95 ind . the wind turbine speed can also be controlled through the voltage in generator rotor ( fig . 7 ) . regarding the voltage in the connection point of the wind power plant , it is important to mention that the voltage in the connection point depends both on the reactive power of the wind power plant and the type of connection to the distribution system , i.e . place of connection .

figure 6 voltage in a connection point depending on reactive power of the wind power plant ( connection 1-kiršina , connection 2-čve ) ( voltage/reactive power ) slika 6. napon u čvorištu priključenja u ovisnosti o jalovoj snazi vjetroelektrane ( priključak 1.- kiršina , priključak 2.- čve )

figure 5 linear change of wind speed and the influence on active and reactive power of dfig slika 5. linearna promjena brzine vjetra i utjecaj na djelatnu i jalovu snagu dfig

accordingly , there are two possibilities to connect the wind power plant ravne on the island of pag to the distribution system , and these are connection point 1 – node ts kiršina 10 kv and connection point 2 – node čve 10 kv ( fig . 7 ) . in the inductive operation of the wind power plant , the voltage increase in the connection point is considerably higher if compared with capacitive operation . discrepancies due to different types of connections are significant . moreover , voltage deviations/changes in the connection point are present in the case when the wind power plant is connected to the node čve which lets us conclude that the connection point 2 has lower voltage stiffness than connection point 1 .

2.2 noise change of wind power šumna promjena brzine vjetra
noise change of wind speed ( fig . 8 ) illustrates capability of the dfig based wind power plant to regulate the reactive power exchange with the network . noise change of wind speed causes fluctuations of output power which can be seen in fig . 9 .

figure 9 influence of reference and real speed of the wpp on voltage value in a connection point slika 9. utjecaj referentne i stvarne brzine vrtnje ve na iznos napona u čvorištu priključenja

the active power generated by the wind power plant depends on wind speed changes , while reactive power is kept at the initial value by regulating the unity power factor of generator stator through rotor voltage vrd .

2.3 gust change of wind power udarna promjena brzine vjetra
at gust change of wind speed , fast fluctuations of active p and reactive power q occur ( fig . 8 ) . at the initial and final value of wind speed of 8,5 m/s , the wind power plant injects approximately 1,8 mw of active power while the reactive power is totally compensated . in variable wind speed conditions , the wind turbine generates variable reactive power ranging from 1,1 mw to 4,0 mw . furthermore , due to the applied control system the reactive power generated by dfig based wind power plants is kept at approximately zero value during gust change of wind speed . output power fluctuations due to gust change of wind speed cause the occurrence of voltage fluctuations . the reference and real rotation speed of the wind turbine ( nωtref and nωt ) vary between 0,8 pu and 1,28 pu ( fig . 9 ) .

2.4 continuous change of wind speed stalna promjena brzine vrtnje
the total amount of active p and reactive power q were measured in the in-feed point at the 10 kv side during 48hour period ( fig . 10 ) depending on constant and continuous variable wind speed .

figure 10 total active and reactive power depending on constant and continuous variable wind speed slika 10. ukupna djelatna i jalova snaga u ovisnosti o stalnoj i stalno promjenjivoj brzini vjetra

the influence of two constant speeds ( 4 and 16 m/s ) and one continuous variable speed ( 4 - 25 m/s ) have been analysed . the defined wind speeds cause variability of active and reactive power that the wind power plant injects into the 10 kv network ( fig . 11 ) . the wind power plant injects a variable amount of active power into the network , while the reactive power of the asynchronous generator is

compensated through a continuous control system . the reference value – rotation speed of the wind turbine ( nωtref ) is variable and depends on the wind speed .

3 criteria for connection of a wind power plant to the transmission system kriteriji priključenja vjetroelektrane na prijenosni sustav
for the purpose of connecting a wind power plant to the transmission system technical criteria are considered which ensure a quality connection of larger wind power plants ( ≥ 50 mw ) to a high voltage transmission system ( 110 kv ) . due to a sudden change of the wind power plant output power according to the change of wind speed , it is important to analyze dynamic properties of the system that also depend on the technology of wind power plant design and an interaction of adjacent synchronous generators connected to the same voltage level . the purpose of technical criteria and general network rules is to preserve the most important properties of the power system , such as security of power supply , power reliability and quality for a short-term and long-term period [ 3 , 10 , 11 , 12 ] .

3.1 requests with respect to frequency zahtjevi s obzirom na frekvenciju
important factors under consideration with respect to connection of a wind power plant to the transmission system are as follows : frequency range in the system during normal and ! disturbed operating conditions ; wind power plant characteristics within the whole ! system frequency range ; participation of a wind power plant in frequency ! regulation and active power control ; speed change referring to wind power production ; ! ensurance of spare power by the wind power plant . ! table 1 shows frequency ranges regulating conditions of the expected wind power plant operation in certain european power systems in which there exist network rules for wind power plants [ 3 , 10 , 11 , 12 ] . table 2 gives requests with respect to participation of wind power plants in frequency regulation and active power production in some european systems . on the basis of these data it can be stated that frequency response of a wind power plant is required in most of the european countries , i.e . participation of a wind power plant in frequency regulation in the distribution network . according to croatian requests [ 12 ] , wpp power must be regulated according to frequencies based upon a characteristic given in figure 12 .

figure 11 total active and reactive power depending on reference speed of the wind power plant slika 11. ukupna djelatna i jalova snaga u ovisnosti o referentnoj brzini vjetroturbine

based on the analysis and considering different wind speed conditions as well as different connection points , it can be concluded that the output values of the same wind power plant at different voltage level connection locations vary considerably . in other words , electrical conditions in the network can limit the quality of wind power plant operation regardless of its high technological design . five main criteria to be fulfilled with the aim of connecting wind power plants to the distribution system are as follows : 1 ) 2 ) 3 ) 4 ) 5 ) requests with respect to frequency requests with respect to voltage requests with respect to fault ride-through capability requests with respect to quality of delivered energy requests with respect to signals , communications and control .

the netherlands contribution of wpp to primary frequency regulation is required with limitations set by control strategy and wind conditions .

individual european systems . in table 3 power factor is defined either only by the registered capacity of the wind power plant or within the overall production power range . mutual comparison of requests with respect to reactive power shows a tendency to have wind power plants resemble conventional power plants as much as possible in terms of great construction and connection to the transmission system operating at the greatest power factor range possible .

according to the technical regulation given in figure 12 , disconnection of a wind generator is conditioned if the value of frequency increases above 51,5 hz , and the wind generator can be connected to the system again if the value of frequency decreases below 50,5 hz .

3.2 requests with respect to voltage zahtjevi s obzirom na napon
principal requests in relation to voltage in the transmission system to which a wind power plant is connected refer to voltage ranges and its change , automatic voltage regulation and the ability of reactive power production . two requests are considered . these are voltage range that has to be maintained in the connection of a wind power plant to the transmission system and a certain level of reactive power compensation , i.e . its exchange with the system [ 3 , 10 , 11 , 12 ] . table 3 shows requests set for

in case of power failures or faults in the system , connections between the power system and a wind power plant prove to be very significant , so that it is necessary to know the influence of a connection of large wind power plants to the transmission system and their response during power failures like short circuits in the system . since the size of wind power plants is constantly increasing , the ability of wind power plants to overcome power failure conditions becomes more and more important , because this is linked to the overall stability of the power system [ 3 , 10 , 11 , 12 ] . requests of individual european systems regarding the ability of a wind power plant to overcome a power failure ( the fault ride-through capability ) are shown in table 4. according to the given data , it can be concluded that system requests are rather difficult , which actually implies that every system is unique as to its attitudes referring to states of faults . according to croatian requests [ 12 ] , every wind power plant must be capable of standing voltage dips to the level of 15 % of the nominal voltage in the period of 625 ms without disconnecting the connection . if the voltage value in the connection point decreases quasi-stationary ( it does not change faster than 5 % per minute ) to the level below 90 % of the nominal voltage . a wind power plant must be disconnected in 3 seconds at the earliest , figure 13 .

short-term period is also required . in addition to the electrical power quality , implementation of iec regulations is proposed for all measurements , e.g . measurements of flickers , harmonics , peak power , power factor , etc . [ 3 , 10 , 11 , 12 ] .

3.5 requests with respect to signals , communications and control zahtjevi s obzirom na signale , komunikacije i upravljanje
system of communications must be designed for every wind power plant that is built for every single wind generator . the owner of a wind power plant is responsible for getting signals indispensable to the control of power system operation . in addition to active and reactive production power , other signals might be requested as well , such as the status of a wind power plant and wind speed on the location where it is built . fundamental data for connection of a wind power plant to the transmission system are as follows : information signals from the wind power plant towards ! the system operator ; control signals from the system operator towards the ! wind power plant ; prediction of production active power and power ! declaration . all european system regulations require availability of voltage signals , active power , reactive power and the operation status of a wind power plant . some european systems individually require the following as well : availability of the wind speed signal ; ! wind speed , temperature and pressure signal in real ! time ; frequency regulation status ( on/off ) and information ! on disturbances causing shutdown and restarting of a wind power plant within 15 minutes ; information on regulation abilities ; ! information on the position of a transmission ratio ! switch of a transformer by means of which a wind power plant is connected to the transmission system ; ability of controlling a wind power plant from outside . ! e.g . for a wind power plant larger than 20 mw sweden requires functional ability of local manual control or remote control 15 minutes after a fault occurs for the purpose of separation from the system , connection to the system , and control of active and reactive power , while denmark requires the possibility of connecting and separating a wind power plant from the system outside .

3.4 requests with respect to the quality of distributed electrical power zahtjevi s obzirom na kvalitetu električne energije
when it comes to the quality of electrical power , it must be taken into consideration that by means of the generated electrical power wind power plants might affect other users in the system , especially those ones located in their vicinity , i.e . it is necessary to define the procedure by whose application aggravation of the quality in the transmission system upon connection of a wind power plant could be avoided . estimation of the distributed electrical power quality is carried out on the basis of the following factors : flicker emissions – voltage disturbances in the area of ! low frequencies ; fast voltage changes , single fast changes of effective ! voltage values , whereby voltage changes have a certain duration ( e.g . they occur by circuit operations of wind turbine generators ) ; harmonics – periodic voltage or power disturbances ! with frequencies n ´ 50 hz ( n is an integer ) . this might be exemplified by scottish and danish rules setting requests with respect to the quality in 50-60 kv systems according to which voltage changes should be less than 3 % of the nominal voltage in the point where a wind power plant is connected to the system . denmark sets additional requests with respect to fast voltage changes as to the rate of changes ( from the rate of 10 times per hour < 2,5 % to the rate of 100 times per hour < 1,5 % ) . in addition , definition of special requests with respect to flicker emissions and harmonics in a long-term and a

influence of wind power plants on power system operation – part one : wind power plant operation and network connection criteria

d. crnković , d. šljivac , m. stojkov

it can be said for all technical criteria referring to connection of wind power plants that they are necessary for connection of wind power plants to the power system , and they are generally referred to as network rules for wind power plants [ 3 , 10 , 11 , 12 ] .

4 conclusion zaključak
based upon the aforementioned , it is obvious that building wind power plants in the republic of croatia has been encouraged in recent times . for future development of building it is important to be familiar with all technical aspects of wind power plant operation that are key to selecting a wind power plant type on a certain location , since every location has a special regime of wind speed change . after harmonization of wind power plants with the present state of regime of wind speed change on some location it is necessary to satisfy all criteria as to connection of a wind power plant to a distribution network , such as frequency , voltage , overcoming the state of failure , quality of the delivered electrical power , signals , communications and control . on the basis of that a conclusion can be drawn that the selection of a wind power plant and its connection to the distribution network is a rather complex procedure .

large wind turbines - commercial applications

wind energy
a guide for wind site development
wind power development
putting wind to work has been a goal of civilization down through the ages . wind is a free , renewable fuel that has been used to power ships , grind grain , and pump water . technical improvements over the past decade have increased the size and power output capacity of wind turbines , significantly reducing the cost of using wind to generate electricity . federal and state funded research , development , and other financial incentives , such a payments tied to production and tax benefits , have spurred wind project development in recent years . the new york state energy research and development authority ( nyserda ) has funded major projects to map new york ’ s wind and encourage the development of wind power across the state . with assistance from nyserda , several large-scale wind farms have been developed in new york state and several other projects are at various stages of development .

what is wind energy and how does it work ?
wind is created when the sun unevenly heats the earth ’ s surface . wind turbines capture the wind in their blades ( or rotor ) and then convert the wind energy to rotational or mechanical energy . the rotor drives an attached shaft and a gearbox and generator to produce electrical energy . together , the gearbox and generator are called the drive train . the electricity generated by the wind turbine is metered and then delivered to the electric transmission grid for consumption . the wind turbine includes a tower that supports the rotor , drive train , and other equipment such as the controls , electrical
continued

cables , and interconnection hardware . each turbine is controlled by a computer . in large projects with multiple wind turbines , each turbine computer is connected to a central computer where plant operators can remotely monitor the turbines . each turbine has a wind vane that sends a signal to the computer , which then turns the turbine directly into the wind . wind turbines are designed with a cut-in speed , or wind speed , at which it begins to produce power , and a cut-out speed , or the wind speed at which the turbine will be shut down to prevent the drive train from being damaged . cut-in speeds are typically seven to nine mph . maximum electric gener-ation occurs at speeds of 30-35 miles per hour ( mph ) . as wind speeds increase beyond 30-35 mph , the generator maintains its maximum electrical generation until wind speeds reach 55-65 mph and the turbine cuts-out . when the cut-out wind speed is reached , the turbine automatically stops production and is revolved from the wind to protect the drive train from mechanical damage . as high winds subside , the computer automatically revolves the turbine back into the wind and the unit returns to operation . output from a wind turbine , or a wind energy plant , is always changing because the wind is never constant . over the course of a year , wind power plants typically operate at an average of 30-35 percent of their rated capacity . output depends on factors such as average wind speeds , the design of the turbine ( i.e . , blade shape ) , and operating characteristics such as cutout speed , reliability , and the efficiency of the drive train . a 100 megawatt ( mw ) wind power plant in new york state will produce 30-35 mw and could produce the same amount of electricity that is used by approximately 44,000 households .

what are the steps associated with developing and constructing a wind energy project ? the essential steps are : locate a region that offers good wind resource potential , appropriate amounts of land with open and accessible acreage , interested communities and landowners , access to transmission lines , and no obvious environmental concerns . assess wind characteristics at specific locations and acquire landowner approval to install a meteorological tower ( about 130160 feet tall ) to collect wind data for a year or longer . develop a project layout and conduct meetings with local governments and landowners to secure access , permits , and approvals . perform environmental evaluations to ensure the project poses no significant environmental impact . negotiate power sale contract ( s ) with financially stable energy purchasers . evaluate and purchase wind turbines and finalize installation contracts . begin construction - construction requires six to nine months once a notice to proceed is granted . test and evaluate functions of the completed plant to ensure proper operation . this entire process takes about two to three years depending on local conditions .

what makes a good wind site ? do i have a good wind site ?
sustained wind speeds are critical to a project ’ s economic viability . wind turbines require a minimum annual average wind speed above 15 mph , or 6.7 meters per second . the proximity of turbines to electric transmission lines is another important factor in evaluating the economic viability of a project . due to the high costs associated with building transmission lines , most wind projects are located within three miles of high-voltage transmission lines . also , land features ( hills and ravines ) , vegetation , and nearby structures can affect how valuable a site is for wind energy development . in new york , high hilltops , relatively free of trees and buildings , are favorable for a wind energy project . factors such as the accessibility of the land for construction , soil type , and terrain impact construction as well as maintenance needs and costs . environmental impacts related to view-sheds , noise , birds , wetlands , and historical preservation are crucial to the viability of a project and its community acceptance .

how much land is required ?
large wind projects require 10-30 acres of land per turbine to provide adequate exposure to the wind , proper setbacks from homes and roadways , and appropriate spacing between turbines . terrain features also need to be considered . space is needed around a turbine for a 20-foot , gravel access road , a 10x12 foot concrete pad for an electrical transformer , and the turbine foundation . excavating requirements and the type of foundation needed for each turbine will depend on turbine size , soil conditions , and methods employed . foundations are concrete and can be a buried slab with a support column or

how big are wind projects in comparison to local power plants ?
a buried cylinder . buried slab foundations are 30-50 feet in diameter . buried cylinder foundations are about 15 feet in diameter . excavations for both foundation types are approximately 30-60 feet in diameter . power cables between turbines are buried at least three feet below the surface to accommodate farming needs . a project usually includes a substation where power is transformed to be compatible with the high-voltage transmission system or grid .
local power plants

what is the visual impact on the landscape ?
wind energy projects alter the visual landscape of an area or region . wind turbines will most likely be the largest structure in the landscape and the blades attract attention because they rotate . surrounding terrain features can also influence the look of a wind energy project . since wind turbines are commonly located on the highest areas in a region , the surrounding terrain can often block the views of the turbines from different view points . project views will vary in different seasons and even during different times of the day . to meet federal aviation administration requirements , turbines must be illuminated at night with red or clear strobe lights . view-shed analysis and computer-aided visualizations of potential project layouts provide communities with realistic examples of how a project will look from different perspectives . it is common to modify proposed turbine locations to enhance the visual appeal of a project , assuming it does not adversely impact the energy output from the project .

can i hear the turbines ?
noise issues were associated with some early wind projects , however , noise has been reduced through advances in system designs and the appropriate use of setbacks from residences . typical noise levels from turbines , at the base of a tower , are 80-90 decibels ( db ) , or the same level of noise you would routinely hear inside a home or office . noise levels drop to about 35 db at onequarter of a mile ( 1,300 feet ) from the turbine . at this distance , the turbines are barely discernible above normal conversation and their noise is typically muted by the naturally occurring noises at a site . if turbines are sited 1,000 feet or more from residences , noise concerns are usually mitigated .

how big are today ’ s commercial turbines ?
wind energy projects are being built with turbines ranging in size from 660 kw to 1500 kw ( 1,000kw= 1mw ) . examples of turbines are :
vestas v-47 – 660 kw wind turbine rotor diameter : 154 ft ( 47 m ) blade length : 75.5 ft ( 23 m ) tower height : 196 ft ( 60 m ) total height ( tower and blades ) : 273 ft ( 83.5 m ) ge wind energy – 1.5 mw wind turbine rotor diameter : 231 ft ( 70.5 m ) blade length : 111 ft ( 34 m ) tower height : 213 ft ( 65 m ) total height ( tower and blades ) : 328 ft ( 100 m )

how much revenue do turbines provide ?
payments to landowners are commonly structured in a land lease , but developers may purchase the land or seek wind easements . in a land lease , the developer obtains exclusive access to the land for wind energy-related requirements , for a period of 20-30 years . in return , land-owners are paid in a lump sum , or through annual royalty payments based on the amount of energy produced by the turbines installed on the land , and can continue to use most of the land for routine activities such as farming . annual payments depend on a variety of factors and can range from $ 300 to $ 3,000 per mw . wind easements are often used by developers to ensure that vital land and associated air space are kept available for transmission access , additional turbine installations , or to ensure adequate exposure to the wind . wind easements are normally negotiated in perpetuity and developers are usually compensated with a one-time , up-front payment .

today ’ s turbines are taller than niagara falls and about the height of the statue of liberty .

what are the benefits of wind energy ?
wind energy is inexhaustible and non-polluting . it is also compatible with mixed land use such as grazing or agriculture . wind energy projects are modular and the development and construction process is relatively fast when compared to bringing a new coal or nuclear plant on line . wind output prices
continued

large wind turbines - commercial applications

are not susceptible to price fluctuations like petroleumbased fuels , although the sale of the wind plant output must compete in the marketplace against competing fuels .

additional rural benefits include :
economic diversification - wind energy provides farming communities with a new source of long-term revenue without a significant impact to existing agricultural operations . new jobs for wind turbine construction , operation , and maintenance are created , some materials and supplies can be purchased locally , and landowners will benefit from payments from developers . increased tax base - wind projects make payments to local taxing authorities ( school districts , town , county , or state governments ) that broaden the local tax base and provide new local revenue , with the potential to reduce tax burdens on local residents .

potential , the developer will install monitoring equipment , pursue power purchase contracts , and initiate other development activities at no cost to the landowner . the risks to a landowner in a land lease are relatively low , since the landowner does not have a financial position in the project . another landowner strategy is to pursue some level of development activities independently , or in a partnership with others . this approach may be more risky , requires significantly more time and financial investment , and only makes sense in areas with a strong market for wind energy . in this strategy , an experienced consultant is hired to collect wind resource measurements on the affected land . the landowner is responsible for the costs of data collection , with the risk that the wind resource is insufficient to attract development . if the a good wind resource exists , a landowner can begin additional development activities or negotiations with developers for land leases or other agreements from a stronger position of knowing the wind resource , based on an independent analysis . 3 ) make contacts - use lists of developers and consultants from sources such as the american wind energy association ( www.awea.org ) , and contact industry members to make them aware of local interest . as discussed above , there are a number of factors that help determine if a site is suitable for a wind energy project , so be prepared to answer questions such as : • how many acres do you own ? what is the current land use ? • are there limitations for construction or operation ? what are neighboring land uses ? • what is the elevation of your land ? how does it compare to the surrounding area ? is your land the highest , or is it otherwise well exposed to prevailing winds ? • how close are you to the nearest high-voltage transmission line ? does it cross your property ? who owns the line ? what is the voltage of the line ? wind projects usually require 69-115 kv transmission lines , 230 kv service may add additional development costs to the project . 4 ) assess community interest - discuss a potential wind project with neighbors , local government officials , and business interests to determine opinions about wind energy development in the area . work with local authorities to develop an approach to attract wind-energy developers to your area that balances community values and needs .

i think i have land that can be developed for wind - what should i do next ?
1 ) educate yourself - first , see how experts have characterized new york state ’ s wind patterns in the wind energy map found at : http : //www.truewind.com . this map will help you learn more about the estimated wind speeds at your site . then , visit sites such as www.powernatrurally.org to learn more about the development process , wind technology , the major stakeholders in the wind industry , and landowner experiences . consider the long-term desirability for hosting a wind turbine or participating in a wind energy project , weighing all the risks and rewards associated with such projects . consult with a attorney regarding landowner rights and responsibilities . 2 ) consider various development strategies as mentioned above- the most common agreement available to a landowner is a land lease with a developer in return for a lump sum payment , or annual payments , or perhaps some combination of the two . developers often start by signing a land-lease option and then collect wind data ( data is typically collected for one year ) before signing a long-term lease . it is important to note that a land lease with a developer does not guarantee that a project will be built on your land . a developer must have both the financial means to build the project and the ability to sell the project ’ s output over the long-term to make the project economically viable . if it looks like the site has

'' for smaller wind turbines , the problem of ice prevention is even more severe due to the higher ice collection efficiency and smaller potential power output when compared with a larger turbine . for more severe icing events , stopping the turbine may be the most logical solution due to the energy required for ice prevention and wear on the machine . stopping a wind turbine during the presence of every icing condition , however , would be non-productive . for slight to moderate icing events , where the turbine continues to operate but at reduced levels of efficiency , it may be beneficial to continue operation with , or perhaps , without anti-icing devices in place . the determination of the best option to maximize energy output from the turbine operating in an icing environment requires a knowledge of the performance loss that can be expected during the icing event . there have already been several investigations of airfoils operating in icing conditions as related to aircraft . these studies , however , have mainly focused on a range of angles of attack up to sta : ' for airfoils with ice accretions based on aircraft flight conditions . expanded angle of attack ranges through stall are necessary to properly predict wind turbine performance . furthermore , blade leading-edge ice shapes based on meteorological conditions prevalent during wind turbine icing events must be generated for good correlation of airfoil performance experimental data to full-scale wind turbines .

abstract
the effects of rime ice on horizontal axis wind turbine performance were estimated . for typical supercooled fog conditions found in cold northern regions , four rime ice accretions on the s809 wind turbine airfoil were predicted using the nasa lewice code . the resulting airfoil/ice profile combinations were wind-tunnel tested to obtain the lift , drag and pitching moment characteristics over the reynolds number range 1-2 x 106. these data were used in the propid wind-turbine performance prediction code to predict the effects of rime ice on a 450-kw rated-power , 28.7-m diameter turbine operated under both stall-regulated and variable-speed modes . performance losses on the order of 20 % were observed for the variable-speed rotor . for the stallregulated rotor , however , a relatively small rime ice profile yielded significantly larger performance losses . for a larger o.osc long rime ice protrusion , however , the rated peak power was exceeded by 16 % because at high angles the rime ice shape acted like a leading edge flap , thereby increasing the airfoil c^max and delaying stall .

introduction
for many northern regions of the world , the best locations for the placement of wind energy stations are along coastal areas or on the tops of hills and mountains . these locations , however , are inherently susceptible to atmospheric icing events during the winter months . performance degradation of horizontal axis wind turbines ( hawts ) due to ice accretion has been investigated on a number of machines at different locations.1 '' 6 power output can be negligible for a wind turbine operating under extreme icing conditions . furthermore , random shedding of ice from the rotating turbine blades can cause severe out-of-balance loads on the wind turbine . these copyright©1997 by william j. jasinski , shawn c. noe , michael s. selig and michael b. bragg . published by the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics , inc. with permission . *graduate research assistant . student member aiaa . f graduate research assistant . currently engineer , hughes missile systems co. , tuscon , az 85734 t assistant professor . member aiaa . s professor . member aiaa .

to predict the degradation in wind turbine performance due to icing , wind tunnel tests were conducted on the s809 wind-turbine airfoil8 ( see fig . 1 ) under clean and various icing conditions . lift , drag and pitching moment data were taken over the reynolds number range of 1-2 x 106. the icing conditions studied included initial ice accretions and four rime ice accretions that were determined using the nasa lewice code.9 the airfoil performance data were then used in the strip-theory code propid10 to predict the effects of ice accretions on wind turbine performance .

experimental methods
the experiments were performed at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign ( uiuc ) low-turbulence subsonic wind tunnel . the tunnel is a conventional open-return type with a contraction ratio of 7.5:1. test section dimensions are approximately 2.8 x 4 ft , widening approximately 0.5 in . over the 8-ft length of the test section to allow for boundary-layer growth . the tunnel inlet settling chamber contains 4-in . thick honeycomb
followed by four anti-turbulence screens . test section

flow velocity can be varied up to 160 mph ( 235 ft/sec ) , which corresponds to a reynolds number of approximately 1.5 x 106/ft . the two-dimensional s809 airfoil model was cantilevered vertically in the tunnel , spanning the test section height . the 18-in . chord model was constructed of

a carbon-fiber skin surrounding a foam core . steel pipe spars spanned the length of the model at the 20 % and 60 % chord stations and attached to the balance force
plate through a flange . to ensure that the model did not

touch the tunnel walls , the model was fixtured to allow for ~ 0.020 in . gap at the balance ( floor ) and ~ 0.035 in . at the free end ( ceiling ) . to determine the profile accuracy of the model , it was digitized with a brown & : sharpe coordinate measuring machine . the measured coordinates at the model centerline were compared with the true coordinates using a 2-d least squares approach ( rotation and vertical translation ) . figure 1 shows the comparison of the s809 measured model coordinates ( dot-dash line ) and true coordinates ( solid line ) . the figure depicts the differences between the model airfoil and the true for the airfoil upper surface ( solid line ) and lower surface ( dot-dash line ) . a displacement above or below the axis means that the model surface lies above or below the true , respectively . thus , the s809 was thicker than the true airfoil by approximately 0.015 in . over most of the airfoil chord . airfoil lift and moment data were taken with a threecomponent external floor-mounted balance manufactured by aerotech ate limited of heathfield , uk . the normal and axial forces measured by the balance were

used to determine the lift force . drag data over the low drag range ( typically —7 to 8 deg ) was determined by the standard wake momentum deficit method reported by jones11 and described in schlichting.12 three total-head pressure probes spaced 3 in . apart were traversed horizontally through the wake ( perpendicular to the model span ) at 0.15-in . intervals . the center probe approximately corresponded to the center of the model . pressures were acquired using a pressure systems , inc. 8400 electronically scanned pressure system with ±1 psid and ±5 psid pressure scanners . for angles of attack higher than approximately 8 deg , drag data used later in the wind turbine performance prediction section were taken from balance measurements . lift , drag and moment data taken on the s809 model for re = 1.5 x 106 is shown in fig . 2 and compared with data taken at delft13 and the ohio state university ( osu ) .14 although there are some differences , particularly at the corners of the polar , the agreement shown is good , and this serves to validate the current approach.15

icing conditions and simulation
the model was tested with simulated initial and rime ice accretions based on predictions that were determined using the nasa-lewis lewice code ( version 1.6 ) ,9 which uses the messinger ice-accretion model.16 in the model , any unfrozen water runs back on top of the frozen water layer in a uniform wet film . this assumption works well for the rime accretions where the temperatures are so low that the freezing occurs quickly with little run back.17 the particular icing conditions considered are listed in table 1. these ground icing conditions are representative of those experienced by the primary airfoil ( 75 % blade-radius station ) of a typical 450 kw wind turbine in operation during supercooled fog/cloud conditions ( hereafter simply referred to a supercooled fog ) . supercooled fog conditions , which give rise to rime ice accretions , mainly occur along coastal regions and/or mountain peaks in the northwestern united states , alaska , greenland , and valleys in western europe . rime ice ac-

erections on wind turbines are particularly problematic in some regions of finland where conditions for rime ice can last for 20-25 consecutive days.18 in the current study , the principal parameters varied included the accretion time and droplet size . the resulting ice profiles are shown in fig . 3 and are typical of rime ice profiles seen on wind turbines under such conditions . the table lwc refers to the liquid water content . the onset of ice accretion ( light rime ice ) was simulated by applying aluminum oxide grit over the model leading edge . the limits of simulated accretion were on the upper surface x/c = 0.005 and on the lower surface x/c = 0.05. two different degrees of rough-

ness were simulated by using 46- and 16-grit aluminum oxide , which corresponded to k/c values of 0.0009 and 0.0019 , respectively , where k is the nominal grit diameter . the approximate grit densities for the initial ice accretions were 400/in2 for k/c = 0.0009 and 15/in2 for k/c = 0.0019. simulated rime ice accretions for the profiles shown in fig . 3 were manufactured from foamcores covered with carbon-fiber skins . these ice profiles were secured to the model leading edge with tape along the span and screws at the end cap ribs . again , 46and 16-grit aluminum oxide was used to simulated the rime ice roughness ; however , due to the more lengthy ice accretion times , the grit densities were increased to approximately 1000/in2 for k/c = 0.0009 and 85/in2 for k/c = 0.0019. the grit in this case was only applied to the rime ice profile .

test results
in this section , highlights of the airfoil performance data are presented and discussed . figure 4 shows the ci-a , ci-cm^n and ci-cd curves for re = 1 x 106 and 2 x 106. data are shown for the airfoil under clean conditions with leading-edge grit roughness ( legr ) and with ice profiles r2 and r4 for k/c = 0.0019. it should be realized that the coefficients are normalized by the
nominal airfoil chord . if the data for the ice profiles were

horn , the corresponding coefficients would be reduced by 2.5 % and 7.2 % for cases r2 and r4 , respectively . the two most obvious features of the polars are the large loss in lift and the increase in drag as the degree of icing increases . it is particularly noticeable that the lowest drag for the icing cases corresponds to the angle of attack used to generate the ice profiles , that is a = 5 deg — a result that is typical of other tests on iced airfoils . above and below this angle of attack , significant flow separation occurs on the upper and lower surfaces , respectively . the result is an increase in drag above and below the 5 deg angle of attack . the sharp rise in drag above 5 deg is caused by the rapid growth of upper surface separation , which is also reflected in the change in the lift curve slope .

several other interesting features can be identified . firstly , fig . 4 illustrates important reynolds number effects . as expected , the drag was reduced with increasing reynolds number for the clean case . for the icing cases , however , the reynolds number effects were minimal because transition to turbulent flow was promoted artificially by the grit roughness—a process that is known to be rather insensitive to reynolds number for large roughness . secondly , the rather dramatic increase in citmax and stall delay for ice profile r4 as compared with the clean case and the other icing cases is surprising . it is , however , similar to the effects produced by leading-edge flaps.19'20 thirdly , as the icing becomes more extreme , the separation pocket on the lower surface at zero lift grows , thereby producing a

slight increase in the zero-lift angle of attack . finally , the pitching moment curves change rather dramatically as compared with the clean case . this trend is most easily explained by considering the r4 case . as the angle of attack is increased , the pitching moment becomes more positive , which is indicative of a center of pressure
that moves forward . this movement is attributable to

the large upper-surface leading-edge suction peak , which becomes more extreme with increasing angle of attack . additional tests were performed to determine the effect of roughness on the ice shapes . the results shown in fig . 5 for case rl at re = i x 106 and 1.5 x 106 are quite typical of the other cases . when the roughness is reduced from k/c = 0.0019 to 0.0009 , there is a small drag reduction . when no roughness is used , however , drag is substantially reduced and the low drag range is extended to both higher and lower lift coefficients . these changes result from less separated flow as can be deduced from the increase in lift over the entire positive lift range . clearly , these results underscore the importance of simulating the roughness of the rime ice .

figure 7a shows the predicted performance for the stall-regulated rotor for the clean case and for rime ice cases r2 and r4 with k/c = 0.0019. corresponding data is shown in fig . 7b for the variable-speed rotor . it is known that for the variable-speed rotors in operation at constant tip speed ratio , the ( ^-distribution along the blade span remains the same for wind speeds below that for rated power . thus , the percentage loss in performance due to icing is nearly constant at all wind speeds—14.5 % for rime ice profile r2 and 20 % for r4 . for the stall-regulated rotor , the lift coefficient along the blade span changes with wind speed , and this leads to substantially different effects as compared with the variable-speed case . for wind speeds above approximately 13 m/s , the power curves are dictated largely by the airfoil characteristics in the vicinity of stall . in particular , a higher cltmax produces a higher peak rotor power . for rime ice profile r2 , the ci > max is below that for the clean airfoil ( see fig . 4 ) . consequently , the power curve falls below that for the clean case . both the loss

in lift and increase in drag lead to the substantial loss

in peak rotor power . for rime ice profile r4 , however , the airfoil ci , max is increased over the clean case and the stall is delayed to a higher angle of attack—effects that are produced by the streamlined rime ice profile that acts similar to a leading-edge flap . thus , for rime ice profile r4 , there is a rather large increase in peak power , which unfortunately leads to greater generator and blade loads . this result provides supporting evidence to speculation that ice build-up has been responsible for stall delay and associated peak power excursions on wind turbines in icing environments.21 below 13 m/s

acknowledgments
the support of the national renewable energy laboratory under subcontract xaf-4-14076-03 is gratefully acknowledged . also , the several discussions with
j.l . tangier of nrel proved to be quite helpful during

increase in giimax and a delay in stall to a higher angle of attack . these changes in the airfoil performance lead to a 16 % increase in the peak rotor power—an undesirable result that can lead to generator burn-out and high blade loads . finally , these estimates are conservative since the ice accretion studied here did not attempt to model the extreme icing events sometimes observed on real rotors under more prolonged rime ice conditions .

wind turbine technology

bwea brieﬁng sheet wind turbine technology

since earliest times , man has harnessed the power of the wind , with the ﬁrst mill recorded as long ago as the 6th century ad . the technology has diversiﬁed over the years to include pumping water , grinding grain , powering sawmills and most recently generating electricity , now the fastest growing energy sector worldwide . wind turbine technology has developed rapidly in recent years and europe is at the hub of this hightech industry . wind turbines are becoming more powerful , with the latest turbine models having larger blade lengths which can utilise more wind and therefore produce more electricity , bringing down the cost of renewable energy generation . the ﬁrst commercial wind farm in the uk , built in 1991 at delabole in growth in size of commercial wind turbine design © ewea cornwall , used 400 kilowatt ( kw ) turbines , while the latest trials have involved turbines ten times more powerful , of four megawatts ( mw ) and above . the average size of an onshore wind turbine installed in 2005 was approximately 2 mw . wind turbines have an average working life of 20-25 years , after which the turbines can be replaced with new ones or decommissioned . old turbines can be sold in the second hand market and they also have a scrap value which can be used for any ground restoration work .

how does a wind turbine work ?
wind turbines produce electricity by using the natural power of the wind to drive a generator . the wind is a clean and sustainable fuel source , it does not create emissions and it will never run out as it is constantly replenished by energy from the sun . in many ways , wind turbines are the natural evolution of traditional windmills , but now typically have three blades , which rotate around a horizontal hub at the top of a steel tower . most wind turbines start generating electricity at wind speeds of around 3-4 metres per second ( m/s ) , ( 8 miles per hour ) ; generate maximum ‘ rated ’ power at around 15 m/s ( 30mph ) ; and shut down to prevent storm damage at 25 m/s or above ( 50mph ) . wind turbine technology generating electricity from the wind is simple : wind passes over the blades exerting a turning force . the turbine rotating blades turn a shaft inside the nacelle , which goes into a gearbox . the gearbox increases the rotation speed for the generator , which uses magnetic ﬁelds to convert the rotational energy into
components of a typical wind

electrical energy . the power output goes to a transformer , which converts the electricity from the generator at around 700 volts ( v ) to the right voltage for the distribution system , typically between 11 kv and 132 kv . the regional electricity distribution networks or national grid transmit the electricity around the country , and on into homes and businesses .

offshore technology
offshore wind farms are an exciting new area for the industry , largely due to the fact that there are higher wind speeds available offshore and economies of scale allow for the installation of larger size wind turbines offshore . offshore wind turbine technology is based on the same principles as onshore technology . foundations are constructed to hold the superstructure , of which there are a number of designs , but the most common is a driven pile . the top of the foundation is painted a bright colour to make it visible to ships and has an access platform to allow maintenance teams to dock . subsea cables take the power to a transformer , ( which can be either offshore or onshore ) which converts the electricity to a high voltage ( normally between 33 kv and 132 kv ) before connecting to the grid at a substation on land .

operation and maintenance
both onshore and offshore wind turbines have instruments on top of the nacelle , an anemometer and a wind vane , which respectively measure wind speed and direction . when the wind changes direction , motors turn the nacelle , and the blades along with it , around to face into the wind . the blades also ‘ pitch ’ or angle to ensure that the optimum amount of power is extracted from the wind . all this information is recorded by computers and transmitted to a control centre , which can be many miles away . wind turbines are not physically staffed , although each will have

www.embracewind.com

periodic mechanical checks , often carried out by local ﬁrms . the onboard computers also monitor the performance of each turbine component , and will automatically shut the turbine down if any problems are detected , alerting an engineer that an onsite visit is required . the amount of electricity produced from a wind turbine depends on three factors : 1 ) wind speed the power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed . therefore if the wind blows at twice the speed , its energy content will increase eight-fold . turbines at a site where the wind speed averages 8 m/s produce around 75-100 % more electricity than those where the average wind speed is 6 m/s . 2 ) wind turbine availability this is the capability to operate when the wind is blowing , i.e . when the wind turbine is not undergoing maintenance . this is typically 98 % or above for modern european machines . 3 ) the way wind turbines are arranged

wind farms are laid out so that one turbine does not take the wind away from another . however other factors such as environmental considerations , visibility and grid connection requirements often take precedence over the optimum wind capture layout .

stand-alone and grid-connected small wind turbines
small scale wind turbines can be used in domestic , community and smaller wind energy projects and these can be either stand-alone or grid-connected systems . standalone systems are used to generate electricity for charging batteries to run small electrical applications , often in remote locations where it is expensive or not physically possible to connect to a mains power supply . such examples include rural farms and island communities , with typical applications being water heating or pumping , electric livestock fencing , lighting or any kind of small electronic system needed to control or monitor remote equipment . with grid-connected turbines the output from the wind turbine is directly connected to the existing mains electricity supply . this type of system can be used both for individual wind turbines and for wind farms exporting electricity to the electricity network . a grid-connected wind turbine can be a good proposition if your consumption of electricity is high .

can we rely on the wind ?
wind generation is often described as intermittent , as the wind does not blow continuously . this is a misnomer as it implies an ‘ all or nothing ’ delivery of energy . an individual wind turbine will generate electricity for 70-85 % of the time and its electricity output varies between zero and full output in accordance with the wind speed . however , the combined output of the uk ’ s entire wind power portfolio shows less variability , given the differences in wind speeds over the country as a whole . whilst the amount of wind generation varies , it rarely ( if ever ) goes completely to zero , nor to full output . in order to maintain security of supplies , a second-bysecond balance between generation and demand must be achieved . an excess of generation causes the system frequency to rise whilst an excess of demand causes the system frequency to fall . the electricity system is designed and operated in such a way as to cope with large and small ﬂuctuations in supply and demand . no wind turbine nacelles . picture supplied by slp energy . © charles hodge power station is totally reliable photography , lowestoft and demand is also uncertain . therefore , the system operator establishes reserves that provide a capability to achieve balance given the statistics of variations expected over different timescales . the variability of wind generation is but one component of the generation and demand variations that are considered when setting reserve levels . the gb system operator , national grid transco stated in their seven year statement that “ based on recent analysis of the incidence and variation of wind speed we have found that the expected intermittency of wind does not pose such a major problem for stability and we are conﬁdent that this can be adequately managed.4 ”

summary
wind turbine technology has developed and matured over the years and this technology now forms an increasingly important part of the uk ’ s electricity industry . renewable energy is vital in our ﬁght against climate change and technologies such as wind energy can help in building a sustainable electricity generation system for the future .

marine renewable energy research and development at virginia tech ’ s advanced research institute ( vt-ari )
the past ten years have seen substantial progress in harnessing marine renewable energy resources , particularly offshore winds , waves , and tidal currents . vt-ari researchers are studying the feasibility of these technologies in a variety of north american collaborative projects , as well as investigating their potential contribution to virginia ’ s energy needs .
offshore wind energy is the most commercially mature of the marine renewable energy

technologies , with denmark , germany and the united kingdom being particularly active in its deployment . nearly thirty offshore wind projects are under development in the uk , and these could supply more than 8 % of that nation ’ s annual electricity demand in the coming decade .
the 60-megawatt north hoyle project off the coast of wales is typical of today ’ s offshore wind farms . installed in may 2003 , it consists of thirty vestas 2-mw turbines , each having a rotor diameter of 80 meters . this project occupies an area of six square kilometers .

local fabrication and installation contracts account for about $ 500-600 per kilowatt of an offshore wind farm ’ s capital cost . marine service contracts amount to about one cent per kilowatt-hour . these represent large new business opportunities for the hampton roads region . offshore aquaculture might also be incorporated into such projects , improving the business case and providing added sustainable economic development potential for virginia ’ s coastal communities .
to meet this 20 % level of demand , 6,500 mw of wind turbine capacity would have to be installed , occupying just over a quarter of virginia ’ s continental shelf area between 6 and 20 nautical miles offshore

using the same size and spacing of wind turbines as shown in above photos , an ocean shelf area the size of virginia beach could supply 20 % of the state 's annual electricity demand

the virginia coastal energy research consortium
the virginia coastal energy research consortium was established by the virginia general assembly in 2006. the virginia tech advanced research institute was named as one of five founding members , along with old dominion university , the virginia institute of marine science , norfolk state university , and james madison university . the consortium serves as an interdisciplinary research , study , and information resource for the state on coastal energy resources , including offshore winds , waves , marine biomass , and methane hydrates .

in addition to quantifying the potential energy and economic benefits of offshore wind energy development in virginia , vt-ari researchers also are identifying opportunities for the state ’ s innovative manufacturers to develop lower-cost fabrication materials and methods for marine renewable energy structures . the development of an offshore test bed for large wind turbines and integration of intermittent wind and wave power with other generation sources in the state are other key areas of vt-ari research for the virginia coastal energy research consortium .
tidal current energy can be harnessed by underwater turbines driven by the ebb and flow of the tides . this innovation in tidal power avoids the environmental impacts of damming a bay or estuary . vt-ari is collaborating with the electric power research institute ( epri ) , utilities , and the appropriate state or provincial government agencies to plan and develop demonstration projects for tidal current turbines in the puget sound region and the bay of fundy . vt-ari also is doing tidal and river current modeling studies for verdant power .

turbine operating

this 35-kilowatt underwater turbine was developed by verdant power and assembled in charlottesville , virginia . six of these turbines have been operating in a 200 kw demonstration project in new york ’ s east river ( pictured at left ) since may 2007. the 5 m diameter rotor has three blades and is on the downstream end of the turbine nacelle , which yaws 180° when the tide turns .

wave energy is less mature than offshore wind or tidal current energy , but an epri feasibility

study , in which vt-ari also participated , found that for many sites in the united states , wave power is likely to realize economies of mass production more quickly than wind power . vt-ari is now doing a wave energy forecasting feasibility study for bonneville power administration .

snowtown wind farm snowtown wind farm project facts location : 140 km north of adelaide , south australia project size : 98.7 mw with a capacity factor of over 40 % project timing : 2002 – site development started 2004 – approval for 130 turbines 2007-2008 - stage1 construction ( 47 turbines ) 2010-2011 – stage 2 to be constructed project participants : • owner : trust power ( new zealand-based ) • developer : wind prospect ( adelaide-based ) • wind turbine supplier and head contractor : suzlon ( india-based ) • electrical contractor : downer engineering ( sydney-based ) project development the snowtown wind farm was developed in a similar manner to most wind farms . the development was completed in four stages : site selection - wind prospect selected the site for trust power on the basis that it had all the required characteristics : wind that blows hard and often , close to transmission powerlines and unlikely to cause any ‘ visual amenity ’ objections . site development - requires a lease with the landowners , measurement of the wind resource by erecting 10 m masts for 12 months , grid connection design and costs . site approval – site planning approval requires assessments of ecology , aboriginal heritage , aviation lighting requirements , noise and community objections . culminates in the development of an environmental impact statement ( eis ) . also need to finalise a power purchase agreement , a power generation licence and a transmission connection agreement . construction – suzlon won the engineering , procurement and construction ( epc ) contract to supply turbines and manage the entire construction . project challenges project d elay - the project was delayed for three years between getting approval in 2004 and the start of construction in 2007. this delay was due to a south australian state government moratorium on the development of more wind farms whilst it assessed the impacts of increased wind energy generation on the stability of the power grid . aboriginal h eritage – the site was assessed for both anthropological heritage concerned with dreamtime stories and sites of importance and archaeological heritage concerned with the presence of artefacts . community e ngagement – community concerns and expectations were carefully managed from project inception into ongoing operations . the construction phase is particularly disruptive for landholders and issues such as gates being left open and fences not being repaired can cause major problems and were managed very carefully . site layout – there were many issues to consider when finalising the layout of the site . in addition to heritage and landholder considerations , the site was designed to optimise the economic returns through consideration of soil types , topography , access routes , construction sequence and environmental impacts . detailed wind maps were also developed to ensure the turbines were constructed in the spots showing the greatest wind resource . career opportunities the following roles were filled by people in their 20s for the snowtown wind farm : development officer – driving the development activity , managing design and ecological consultants , providing input to the eis . development engineer – designing the wind farm payout , access points and construction sequence . wind engineers – responsible for installation and monitoring of wind masts and analysis of associated data . construction engineers and technicians – working on the foundations , construction and installation of the towers , turbine installation and commissioning , crane operations . consultant engineers and scientists – civil design , ecologists , archaeologists . electrical engineers and technicians – working on transmission lines . maintenance technicians – six full-time electrical and mechanical technicians manage the ongoing operations . each of these people now has the opportunity to work on wind farms anywhere in the world . snowtown wind farm what are the key criteria for a good wind farm site ? why is each of these important ? draw a flow chart to show the process required to set up and run a wind farm . explain all the factors that are considered in finalising the design of a wind farm . what conflicts might arise from these different factors ? when thinking about ecology , heritage , community and engineering issues , what might be discovered in the approval stage that could mean that a wind farm will not be approved ? what community benefits can be generated by a regional wind farm project such as the snowtown wind farm ? what negative community impacts might occur ? show that the calculations of the electrical energy produced per hour and of the number of households that can have electrical energy in the box on the bottom right of the first page are correct .

abstract
this article describes the development of the musgrove vertical axis wind turbine ( v wt ) a concept , the uk ‘ carmarthen bay ’ wind turbine test programme , and uk government ’ s wind power programme to 1990. one of the most significant developments in the story of british wind power occurred during the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s , with the development of the musgrove vertical axis wind turbine and its inclusion within the uk government ’ s wind turbine test programme . evolving from a supervisor ’ s idea for an undergraduate project at reading university , the musgrove v wt was once seen as an able competitor to the a horizontal axis wind systems that were also being encouraged at the time by both the uk government and the central electricity generating board , the then nationalised electricity utility for england and wales . during the 1980s and 1990s the most developed musgrove v awt system , along with three other commercial turbine designs was tested at carmarthen bay , south wales as part of a national wind power test programme . from these developmental tests , operational data was collected and lessons learnt , which were incorporated into subsequent wind power operations .

1. introduction
it was said in the 1980 ’ s that the uk had more wind power experts per unit of wind energy generated than any other country in the world ! despite the sarcasm of this remark , it is correct that the uk has produced continuing interest in wind power , from the earliest patent by blyth [ 1 ] , through post second world-war developments by experts such as golding [ 2 ] to the post 1973 lobbying of the british wind energy association , which was a key founding influence for the initiation of the european wind energy association . this article aims to tell the story of one aspect of uk wind energy progress , namely the carmarthen bay test site in south wales . this site was established by the largest nationalised utility of the time , the central electricity generating board , for the development of commercial-scale wind turbines for grid-electricity supply . background for this requires an understanding of the historical context and a summary of the uk government ’ s wind-energy policy and funding at the time . a further aim is to outline the background for the most noteworthy type of turbine tested at carmarthen bay , namely the musgrove vertical axis turbine . other sites in the uk hosted the commercial development of wind turbines , the most noteworthy probably being the burgar hill site on the main island of orkney , to the north of mainland scotland . however , the carmarthen bay site was nearest to london .

uk large-scale wind power programme from 1970 to 1990

the intention of the author is to ‘ tell the story ’ and point to the manner of developments . it is not the intention to analyse the engineering features of the machines , nor their performance . such information is mostly buried in reports to the funding agencies and in technical articles . surprisingly few of the latter are in archive journal publications , however , more may be found in conference proceedings .

2. initial stages before large-scale development
even though contemporary policy seems to be to buy danish and german machines , the first industrial-scale electricity-generating wind turbines to be built in the uk were constructed under the direction of the british electrical and allied industries research association ( more commonly known as the electrical research association , or simply the era ) during the 1950s and 1960s . three machines were constructed , all of which were prototype 100kw horizontal axis machines , viz . [ 3 , 4 ] : 1 . 2 . 3. a variable pitch , 3-bladed , 15 m diameter machine installed by the glasgow shipbuilders , john brown ltd. , during 1950 on orkney , scotland . a de havilland propellers ltd. , 24 m diameter 2-bladed enfield-andreau type turbine erected during 1953 in st. albans . another 3-bladed , 15 m diameter machine , with fixed pitch aluminium blades , installed on the isle of man during 1960. coincidental with this wind-power research was a political shift toward technological change that was influencing uk energy policy . the forthcoming prime minister , harold wilson , had been fervently promoting technological advancement , part of which encouraged new energy supply technologies such as nuclear and wave power [ 5 ] . in a speech to the labour party conference in 1963 , wilson painted ‘ an image of progress through technology and [ so ] provided a blueprint for modernisation , which crystallised around the ministry of technology ’ [ 6 ] . at the time , wave power was seen by its supporters as the most favourable non-fossil fuel alternative source , although some held reservations as to how much energy supply systems such as nuclear and wave power could contribute to the nation ’ s energy supply mix . nonetheless the ‘ official view in the mid-1970s was that wave power was the only renewable energy option that merited support ’ as some waves in seas around the coast of britain had a power density of about 77 kw/m of wave front and so had the potential to supply a large proportion of the uk ’ s electricity needs [ 4 , 5 ] . so with the expectation in the 1960s of ‘ abundant nuclear power which would be too cheap to meter ’ , funding for wind power research in the uk was terminated [ 4 ] . however , the oil price crisis of 1973 which increased the price of oil from usd 2 to usd 12 per barrel unexpectedly made renewable sources of energy again of interest . as a result the era established an industrial consortium for uk wind power development , particularly that of horizontal axis turbine technology . this consortium became the wind energy group , ( weg ) in the early 1980 ’ s , with tripartite participation by taylor woodrow construction , by hawker siddeley dynamics and by the cleveland bridge and engineering company . taylor woodrow construction , the largest company in the whole taylor woodrow group , was then in 5 divisions [ 7 ] . one was the design and research division , within which sat the alternative energy systems department , employing 15 engineers responsible for the development of renewable energy supply businesses such as wave , tidal , biomass , and wind power . the major interest however was in wind power , which led to taylor woodrow becoming the managing agent for the weg consortium . weg designed , manufactured and installed , the largest , wind turbine ever built in the uk ; the 60 m diameter , 3 mw ha wt ls-1 located at burgar hill , orkney in scotland . prior to this , weg had installed a

smaller 250 kw , 20 m diameter ha wt at the same site , monitoring this prototype in preparation for operating the larger machine . in a separate project , weg analysed the feasibility of large , off-shore arrays of wind power machines . combining the results of this feasibility study with the experience of operating the 60 m diameter burgar hill ls-1 wind turbine , the next planned phase of weg ’ s wind power programme was to design and test a 100 m diameter ha wt . however , uk government policy shifted towards a more cautious approach , and weg later chose rather to test a smaller , 2-bladed machine . nevertheless , the ls-1 machine continued to operate for several years [ 8 ] .

3. uk large-scale wind power development policy
the uk ’ s government-led wind energy programme , which began in earnest in 1979 , was initially focussed upon ‘ determining the technical and economic feasibility of the [ wind power ] technology ’ [ 9 ] . however the programme subsequently evolved , progressing from technical feasibility assessment activities ( which ran during the mid-1970s to mid-1980s ) , to technology development and demonstration projects ( which continued into the mid-1990s ) . during the 1970s and 1980s responsibility for the uk ’ s wind energy research and development was part of the remit of the uk government ’ s department of energy , ( doe ) . after the doe had published its assessment of ‘ the prospects for the generation of electricity from wind energy in the united kingdom ’ it was able , during 1977 , to further its wind energy programme by allocating £200,000 ( which was to be spent between 1977 and 1979 ) to wind energy research [ 4 , 10 ] . the remit of this part of the research programme was to evaluate industrial-scale , electricity generating turbine designs . this included the aerodynamic efficiency of the machines , how much energy they were able to extract , as well as an analysis of structural engineering issues , such as operational vibrations , stresses , strains and costs [ 7 ] . throughout this early phase of development of the uk large wind turbine industry , it was thought that an expansion of wind power was likely and would result in a need for associated concrete structures such as foundations and wind turbine towers . this attracted civil engineering companies such as t aylor woodrow , sir robert mcalpine and sons ltd , and balfour beatty construction ltd. all these companies became involved in wind turbine development , as they predicted that the construction of wind power plant would provide a substantial market for their civil engineering expertise . so , during the 1970s and 1980s , the uk ’ s large-scale wind energy programme was being spearheaded by consortia comprising large engineering companies such as james howden and co. , the wind energy group ltd. ( which involved t aylor woodrow construction ) , and vertical axis wind turbine ltd. , ( which was a subsidiary of sir robert mcalpine and sons , which later transmuted into res ltd. ) . figures 1–3 show details of the projects [ 11 ] . these consortia undoubtedly affected the form , pace , and direction of the uk wind industry as these companies co-operated in lobbying , but also pursued their own agendas . during the financial year 1985/6 over 50 % of the doe ’ s total renewable energy research and development budget was planned to be spent on wind power , something that ‘ underlined the department ’ s commitment to the development of wind energy technology ’ and the doe ’ s hope that the cost of electricity generated by wind power would fall to 2.5 – 3.2 p/kwh ( 1984 prices ) [ 12 ] . cumulatively until march , 1985 the doe had spent a total of £17 million on wind energy , split as shown in fig . 4 , with a further £6 million planned for expenditure during 1985/6 [ 13 ] . during 1986/7 the doe spent £3 million on its large-wind machine programme , and approximately £1 million ‘ in support of underlying research and development ’ [ 11 ] . until 1986 , the doe had supported uk wind power development in two ways , i.e . , gaining operational experience of the 3 mw ls-1 orkney ha wt and , separately , development of a 135 kw , 25 m diameter v wt at carmarthen bay constructed by vertical axis wind turbines a

culmination of the department of energy ’ s programme in support of the development of large machines for uk main grid operation successful operation of the wind park could lead to a similar off-shore array demonstration in subsequent years ’ [ 14 ] . as table 1 shows , the doe expected to have a ‘ medium-sized machine demonstration wind park ’ built by 1990 which would pave the way for a larger , multi-mw wind park by circa 1995. spending over £4 million per year on large machine developments , the doe held the view ( in 1986 ) that only large-scale multimegawatt machines could substantially contribute to uk energy supplies , and so wanted to support this highly commercially-risky area of development . however , such funding was justified by its successes as by march , 1986 the uk wind power programme had made substantial progress , viz . it had ‘ increased commitment and achievements being made by british companies and progressed with major new wind power construction projects whilst also expanding research focussed on more generic issues ’ [ 13 ] . reinforcing this view , in 1990 the energy-under-secretary noted that ‘ a £10 million project the country ’ s biggest wind farm would be built on ovenden moor , west yorkshire ’ [ 15 ] . however , by 1987 government wind power policy was becoming more cautious . instead of planning windfarms with multi-mw machines , there was [ 11 ] : ‘ a growing body of opinion in the uk which believed that it would be valuable both from a technical and operational point of view to gain experience with a modest array of successfully demonstrated medium-sized machines ( circa 300 kw ) before attempting to construct any demonstration array based on megawatt-sized turbines ’ . however , if all went well , projections made in 1987 described a wind farm comprising 1 mw machines as a ‘ reasonable ’ consideration for construction sometime between 1991 and 1993. during 1988 the government ’ s wind programme was still within its technical feasibility phase . programme tasks therefore were still focused upon four areas , viz . studies of the resource , machines , systems , and supporting research and development , the latter being aimed at better ‘ understanding the technology , to obtain data for input into the machine design and development and to investigate new concepts which offer lower costs or increased energy capture ’ [ 16 ] .

4. the uk central electricity generating board , cegb
during the 1980s the nationalised electrical supply industry for england and wales , the cegb operated a total of 80 coal- , oil- and nuclear-fired power stations with a combined capacity of 50 gw and therefore , was seen by some to be disinterested in renewable energy sources [ 17 ] . however , decision-makers in the cegb realised that they needed to be ‘ sufficiently knowledgeable about wind energy to be able to assess its potential ’ as it was likely that the wind industry would grow , especially with government encouraging industrial-scale wind power development [ 17 ] . so in order to be ready to exploit wind power ’ s commercial possibilities , during 1978 the cegb started its own wind power programme [ 18 ] . the first stage of the programme was aimed at issues such as meteorology , wind effects within wind farm arrays and , with the doe ’ s help , offshore wind resource studies . the cegb also explored exploiting wind power from lowland sites , via the testing of a 200 kw , 24 m diameter ha wt which the cegb had purchased from wtg energy systems inc. , usa . this machine was the first wind turbine to be situated at the cegb ’ s carmarthen bay test site , near burry port in south wales , and was ‘ switched-on ’ on 16th november , 1982 [ 19 ] . at a cost of £650,000 , the cegb chairman at the time , lord marshall , noted that ‘ the wind turbine—was tangible evidence that the cegb was interested in all forms of energy ’ and that they had plans to order a larger ( 300 kw ) wind turbine during 1983 , for operation by 1985 [ 19 ] . the cegb also wanted to select a site for a larger machine at one of 3 locations around the uk : in lincoln , kent or essex . on this site , approximately 10 machines would then be erected .

the cegb also ‘ offered to host an internationally mounted offshore prototype wind machine ’ , although the viability of such a ‘ concept could [ not ] be established before the 1990s ’ . so during the 1980s , the cegb had to focus efforts on developing on-shore wind power technologies [ 19 ] . however , the performance of this first foray into wind power for the cegb , the howden turbine , was ‘ disappointing due to a number of technical details . the operation of the machine [ had ] been severely curtailed as a result of problems experienced with the blades and control systems ’ [ 17 , 20 ] . also , ‘ although considerable effort [ was ] put into obtaining satisfactory operation of the machine—there were a number of technical difficulties which severely limited its operation ’ , resulting in the machine being in use for only 400 hours [ 13 ] . not to be put off , the cegb learnt from the experience and by 1987 , the view of the cegb was that ‘ the best commercial prospects amongst machines actually built , appear to be with medium-sized machines—in the range of 200-350 kw ’ [ 18 ] . other advantages of this size of machine ( and the authors then pre-empting some of the public negativity which was to plague the uk wind industry in the 1990s ) , was that they were quieter and not ‘ too conspicuous and therefore more easily assimilated into the landscape ’ . however , even with these advantages , during the 1980s it was still ‘ not clear—how best to exploit the onshore resource— [ as ] the large numbers needed for bulk generation are [ sic ] a drawback ’ and that ‘ the ultimate exploitation of onshore wind energy will depend on its economic and public acceptability ’ [ 18 ] . such concerns remained at the heart of the cegb ’ s wind power programme .

4.1 the carmarthen bay wind power test programme
the wind power test site at carmarthen bay near burry port , south wales , was located adjacent to an out-of-service cegb coal-fired power station which had been operational between 1954 and 1984. with the a484 road to the north and the sea to its south , the wind

energy demonstration centre was situated on the tip of the coast—see fig . 5. the carmarthen bay site was used by the cegb to host wind turbines made by the three leading uk turbine manufacturers , james howden , weg and v wt ltd. the site , officially named ‘ the a carmarthen bay wind energy demonstration centre ’ , also had a visitor ’ s information centre which was visited by up to 16,000 people per year , as well as a gatehouse to aid site-security [ 21 ] . by hosting uk wind turbines , the cegb wanted to act ‘ as a shop window for uk designs ’ as well as offering to buy the machines , once testing had finished [ 13 ] . in total 5 wind turbines were installed and tested throughout the 1980s—see table 2. after the failed howden machine , the next turbine to be installed at carmarthen bay was a shrouded-vertical axis machine , installed by balfour beatty power construction ltd. during 1985 [ 23 ] . this was nicknamed the ‘ magic mushroom ’ from its unusual appearance . this v wt a was 6 m in diameter , the rotor comprised 5 vertical blades , spring-operated to avoid rotor over-speeding in high winds . located around the rotor , and concentric to it , was a fixed shroud made up of 8 fixed ducts built into an annular dome—see fig . 6. the dome was so designed to increase the amount of energy that the machine could extract from oncoming wind . field tests began in june 1985 , and after 21 months of testing it was concluded that the turbine was ‘ non-cost effective ’ and that an ‘ economic analysis indicated that a cost effective machine could be achieved by reduction in material content and careful design ’ [ 23 ] .

5. the musgrove vertical axis wind turbine
vertical axis turbines have been used ever since the 7th century b.c . , although it was not until 1922 that the design was modernized by savonius , a finnish engineer [ 24 , 25 ] . during 1931 darrieus developed a unique type of v wt , having aerofoil-shaped blades instead of the a cup-shaped blades of the savonius design , therefore employing the more efficient

making it more efficient and easier to manufacture . to avoid over-speeding the first musgrove turbine design had an integrated reefing system which automatically feathered the blades in strong winds . during 1975 , musgrove and his reading-based research team investigated the potential of uk wind power , particularly aiming at enhancing wind turbine efficiency and effectiveness [ 27 , 28 ] . funding given in 1976 from the science research council enabled musgrove to appoint a phd research student , ian mays ( who is now managing director of renewable energy systems ) to further develop the musgrove-v wt . the a research built upon previous work undertaken in britain by the era and others , for british wind research up until 1960 see for example [ 3 , 29–33 ] for american wind power research developments see for example [ 34 ] for a description of the russian balaclava plant see [ 2 , 35 ] . the early experiments which musgrove and his small team undertook at reading university during 1976 and 1977 ‘ validated the basic concept ’ and led to a successful application being made to the uk government for financial support for a feasibility study to consider scaling-up the musgrove turbine [ 5 , 36 ] . as a result , half of the £200,000 doe funding ear-marked for wind turbine development in the late 1970s was used to develop two different types of turbines , including the feasibility of scaling-up a ‘ laboratory scale ’ prototype ‘ musgrove ’ v wt into a ‘ multimegawatt vertical axis wind turbine ’ . research and development into this a had started during 1978 , the results of which encouraged—the department of energy to invite industry to carry the project forward with design studies for a medium sized machine , 25 m in diameter , as a stepping stone to a multimegawatt sized unit ’ [ 37 ] . this initial v wt design a and development work was carried out by a consortium comprising british aerospace aircraft group ( bristol ) , taylor woodrow construction ltd and reading university . however , as large wind tunnel testing was prohibitively expensive , the largest musgrove turbine built and tested at reading university had been limited to 3 m in diameter . upon conclusion of the tests during 1979 , the doe decided that to test the design fully , a life-sized trial was required . however , the doe wanted a ‘ consortium quite separate from the uk horizontal axis wind turbine design group , and [ so ] sir robert mcalpine and sons ltd. were asked to take over project leadership in mid-1979 ’ [ 36 ] . the new consortium , which also included aircraft designs ( bembridge ) ltd. , engineering and power development consultants ltd and nei cranes ltd. , put to the doe in 1980 , a wind power development plan which aimed to develop a 4 mw , 100 m diameter prototype machine by 1986. the detailed plans for the first phase of this programme , i.e . , the development of a 25 m diameter v wt , a was agreed by the doe , and by 1983 funding of £3.5 million was made available [ 36 ] . three contracts were subsequently entered into by v wt ltd and the doe , to ensure funding for a the following v wt work [ 37 ] , i.e . , to : a 1 . 2 . 3. construct a 25 m diameter prototype v wt . a test and monitor the prototype v wt for at least 2 years . a carry out preliminary studies leading to the design of a multimegawatt v wt unit . a

by 1984 v wt ltd. were well underway with the design of the v wt-450 ( 130 kw capacity ) . a a also , the tower and ‘ manufacture of the major components ’ of the machine had made ‘ substantial progress ’ [ 12 ] . by january 1986 the manufacture of the rotor blades , struts and cross-arms of the 25 m musgrove machine was almost complete , with the assembly of the rotor scheduled for the following april . by 28th november , 1986 the completed machine was inaugurated by the under-secretary of state for energy , thus becoming the third turbine to be installed at carmarthen bay . [ 37 ] outline the work undertaken , whilst table 3 gives the specification for the v wt-450 . the v wt-450 turbine had 18 m long vertical blades and could a a produce up to 130 kw in an oncoming wind of 11 m/s ( see fig . 7 ) .

in order to protect the machine from spinning out of control , as well as being a way to control the power output , the machine ’ s automatic computer controlled “ reef ” the blades ( i.e . , blade elements folded to reduce swept area , as in fig . 8 ) so enabling safe operation in wind speeds to 30 m/s . in faster wind speeds , the machine would ‘ shut down ’ by ceasing rotation and being braked . the 25 m tower was built from post tensioned pre-cast concrete rings and the rotor was steel with glass reinforced plastic fairings [ 38 ] . electric generators and other equipment were housed in a plant room at the base of the tower . with more than 200 sensors recording operational data , the computer system was also used to monitor the machine ’ s performance [ 13 ] . also during 1986 , a review of ‘ the commercial and technical potential ’ of the v wt was commissioned by the doe a to consider the operational experience gained from the v wt-450 prototype . other work was a also underway by v wt ltd and funded by the doe , to explore the scaling-up of the v wt-450 a a into a land-based 1 mw machine , as well as a multi-mw offshore machine .

simultaneously to their investigation of the v wt-450 at carmarthen bay , v wt ltd built a a a 17 m diameter , 100 kw v wt demonstration project on the isles of scilly , with part-financing a from the european commission [ 13 ] . another similar machine was built in sardinia [ 7 ] . the isles of scilly were chosen because there was then no undersea electricity link to the uk mainland and so islanders relied upon expensive diesel generators for their electricity needs and for desalinisation . during 1988 , preliminary design work on a larger v wt ( the v wt-850 ) was started [ 16 ] . a a tests had shown that the reefing system was unnecessarily complex ( as power control was automatically achieved by the natural passive-stalling of the aerofoils , even in strong winds with the blades remaining vertical ) . the reefing mechanism was not included in the design for the second machine ( see fig . 8 ) . the v wt-850 was a larger machine , with a rated capacity of 500 kw , again with a ‘ h ’ -shaped blades [ 16 ] . the machine was at the time , europe ’ s biggest vertical axis wind turbine , standing approximately 45 m ( 140 ft ) high , and with a rotor diameter of about 38 m ( 115 ft ) [ 39 ] . it was installed at the carmarthen test site during 1990 , with tests starting in august . this machine operated only until 26th february , 1991 when one of the blades broke , due to an error in the manufacture of the fibreglass blades [ 7 , 40 ] . this led to reports in the local press of the ‘ massive wind turbine—plung [ ing ] to the ground ’ ! [ 40 , 41 ] . nationally , the independent newspaper noted that the turbine had been ‘ the victim of a gust that tore down one of its blades and with it the dreams of many an environmentalist ’ [ 21 ] . the v wt-850 design was a also prohibitively costly , since the concrete tower and supporting structure had to cope with large cycling fatigue-loads as the blades rotated [ 38 ] . another turbine to be built and tested at carmarthen bay was a 2-bladed weg ha wt , shown in fig . 9. it was one of the first weg turbine to use a steel tower , rather than concrete . during 1991 , national wind power , ( nwp ) was formed as a joint venture between the cegb and the parent companies of weg . the responsibility of the carmarthen bay test site

was then transferred to nwp . however by the early 1990s the test site had served its purpose . windfarms ( notably the delabole windfarm , developed as a private venture by farmer peter edwards , i.e . , without government research and development support ) , were being built and so the carmarthen bay test site was closed in late 1990s and the machines removed ! the land is now a coastal park , the nearby power station having also been demolished .

6. conclusions
the carmarthen bay wind power programme provided a ‘ shop window ’ for the electricity supply industries , government , and the public to view the performance of what were then novel , large wind turbines . without this facility , uk companies would not have gained the valuable experience of operating a range of different cutting-edge horizontal and vertical axis wind machines . the uk ’ s wind power test programme of the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s was therefore an example of how government and industry worked together to push technological development . the carmarthen bay tests have also left a valuable legacy that is still shaping worldwide wind power development . the fact remains however , that subsequent history shows that no uk manufacturer of wind turbines continued with a successful run of commercially marketed machines , neither in europe nor elsewhere . danish wind turbines dominated the later uk market , as elsewhere , to be joined mostly by german manufactured machines . there were but a few us manufactured machines . the success of denmark , germany and spain in both manufacture and installing capacity on their own networks is surely due to their policy of feed-laws , rather than giving development grants to specific companies . the uk relied on supporting a small group of uk companies , rather than encouraging a market . whatever the success or otherwise of particular uk manufactured machines , their possible success was doomed by lack of uk market support . post script : dr musgrove , later joined national wind power and was awarded a special lifetime achievement award at the bwea ’ s 24th annual conference in 2002 .

wind turbine technology

bwea brieﬁng sheet wind turbine technology

since earliest times , man has harnessed the power of the wind , with the ﬁrst mill recorded as long ago as the 6th century ad . the technology has diversiﬁed over the years to include pumping water , grinding grain , powering sawmills and most recently generating electricity , now the fastest growing energy sector worldwide . wind turbine technology has developed rapidly in recent years and europe is at the hub of this hightech industry . wind turbines are becoming more powerful , with the latest turbine models having larger blade lengths which can utilise more wind and therefore produce more electricity , bringing down the cost of renewable energy generation . the ﬁrst commercial wind farm in the uk , built in 1991 at delabole in growth in size of commercial wind turbine design © ewea cornwall , used 400 kilowatt ( kw ) turbines , while the latest trials have involved turbines ten times more powerful , of four megawatts ( mw ) and above . the average size of an onshore wind turbine installed in 2005 was approximately 2 mw . wind turbines have an average working life of 20-25 years , after which the turbines can be replaced with new ones or decommissioned . old turbines can be sold in the second hand market and they also have a scrap value which can be used for any ground restoration work .

how does a wind turbine work ?
wind turbines produce electricity by using the natural power of the wind to drive a generator . the wind is a clean and sustainable fuel source , it does not create emissions and it will never run out as it is constantly replenished by energy from the sun . in many ways , wind turbines are the natural evolution of traditional windmills , but now typically have three blades , which rotate around a horizontal hub at the top of a steel tower . most wind turbines start generating electricity at wind speeds of around 3-4 metres per second ( m/s ) , ( 8 miles per hour ) ; generate maximum ‘ rated ’ power at around 15 m/s ( 30mph ) ; and shut down to prevent storm damage at 25 m/s or above ( 50mph ) . wind turbine technology generating electricity from the wind is simple : wind passes over the blades exerting a turning force . the turbine rotating blades turn a shaft inside the nacelle , which goes into a gearbox . the gearbox increases the rotation speed for the generator , which uses magnetic ﬁelds to convert the rotational energy into
components of a typical wind

electrical energy . the power output goes to a transformer , which converts the electricity from the generator at around 700 volts ( v ) to the right voltage for the distribution system , typically between 11 kv and 132 kv . the regional electricity distribution networks or national grid transmit the electricity around the country , and on into homes and businesses .

offshore technology
offshore wind farms are an exciting new area for the industry , largely due to the fact that there are higher wind speeds available offshore and economies of scale allow for the installation of larger size wind turbines offshore . offshore wind turbine technology is based on the same principles as onshore technology . foundations are constructed to hold the superstructure , of which there are a number of designs , but the most common is a driven pile . the top of the foundation is painted a bright colour to make it visible to ships and has an access platform to allow maintenance teams to dock . subsea cables take the power to a transformer , ( which can be either offshore or onshore ) which converts the electricity to a high voltage ( normally between 33 kv and 132 kv ) before connecting to the grid at a substation on land .

operation and maintenance
both onshore and offshore wind turbines have instruments on top of the nacelle , an anemometer and a wind vane , which respectively measure wind speed and direction . when the wind changes direction , motors turn the nacelle , and the blades along with it , around to face into the wind . the blades also ‘ pitch ’ or angle to ensure that the optimum amount of power is extracted from the wind . all this information is recorded by computers and transmitted to a control centre , which can be many miles away . wind turbines are not physically staffed , although each will have

periodic mechanical checks , often carried out by local ﬁrms . the onboard computers also monitor the performance of each turbine component , and will automatically shut the turbine down if any problems are detected , alerting an engineer that an onsite visit is required . the amount of electricity produced from a wind turbine depends on three factors : 1 ) wind speed the power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed . therefore if the wind blows at twice the speed , its energy content will increase eight-fold . turbines at a site where the wind speed averages 8 m/s produce around 75-100 % more electricity than those where the average wind speed is 6 m/s . 2 ) wind turbine availability this is the capability to operate when the wind is blowing , i.e . when the wind turbine is not undergoing maintenance . this is typically 98 % or above for modern european machines . 3 ) the way wind turbines are arranged

wind farms are laid out so that one turbine does not take the wind away from another . however other factors such as environmental considerations , visibility and grid connection requirements often take precedence over the optimum wind capture layout .

stand-alone and grid-connected small wind turbines
small scale wind turbines can be used in domestic , community and smaller wind energy projects and these can be either stand-alone or grid-connected systems . standalone systems are used to generate electricity for charging batteries to run small electrical applications , often in remote locations where it is expensive or not physically possible to connect to a mains power supply . such examples include rural farms and island communities , with typical applications being water heating or pumping , electric livestock fencing , lighting or any kind of small electronic system needed to control or monitor remote equipment . with grid-connected turbines the output from the wind turbine is directly connected to the existing mains electricity supply . this type of system can be used both for individual wind turbines and for wind farms exporting electricity to the electricity network . a grid-connected wind turbine can be a good proposition if your consumption of electricity is high .

can we rely on the wind ?
wind generation is often described as intermittent , as the wind does not blow continuously . this is a misnomer as it implies an ‘ all or nothing ’ delivery of energy . an individual wind turbine will generate electricity for 70-85 % of the time and its electricity output varies between zero and full output in accordance with the wind speed . however , the combined output of the uk ’ s entire wind power portfolio shows less variability , given the differences in wind speeds over the country as a whole . whilst the amount of wind generation varies , it rarely ( if ever ) goes completely to zero , nor to full output . in order to maintain security of supplies , a second-bysecond balance between generation and demand must be achieved . an excess of generation causes the system frequency to rise whilst an excess of demand causes the system frequency to fall . the electricity system is designed and operated in such a way as to cope with large and small ﬂuctuations in supply and demand . no wind turbine nacelles . picture supplied by slp energy . © charles hodge power station is totally reliable photography , lowestoft and demand is also uncertain . therefore , the system operator establishes reserves that provide a capability to achieve balance given the statistics of variations expected over different timescales . the variability of wind generation is but one component of the generation and demand variations that are considered when setting reserve levels . the gb system operator , national grid transco stated in their seven year statement that “ based on recent analysis of the incidence and variation of wind speed we have found that the expected intermittency of wind does not pose such a major problem for stability and we are conﬁdent that this can be adequately managed.4 ”

summary
wind turbine technology has developed and matured over the years and this technology now forms an increasingly important part of the uk ’ s electricity industry . renewable energy is vital in our ﬁght against climate change and technologies such as wind energy can help in building a sustainable electricity generation system for the future .

executive summary
with the recent surge in fossil fuels prices , demands for cleaner energy sources , and government funding incentives , wind turbines have become a viable technology for power generation . currently , horizontal axis wind turbines ( hawt ) dominate the wind energy market due to their large size and high power generation characteristics . however , vertical axis wind turbines ( vawt ) are capable of producing a lot of power , and offer many advantages . the mechanical power generation equipment can be located at ground level , which makes for easy maintenance . also , vawt are omni-directional , meaning they do not need to be pointed in the direction of the wind to produce power . finally , there is potential for large power generation with vawt because their size can be increased greatly . however , there are also downfalls to the vawt . firstly , boundary layer affects from the ground influence the air stream incident on the vawt , which in some cases leads to inconsistent wind patterns . secondly , vawt are not self-starting ; currently , an outside power source is required to start turbine rotation until a certain rotational speed is reached .

the main objective of this project is to design and build a self-starting vertical axis wind turbine . this report outlines the first term efforts in the design of our full-scale vawt , which is to be built early in the second term .

the self-starting issues surrounding vawt will be tackled by the use of alternative blade profiles and pitching mechanisms . a model that carries out turbine theory calculations was created to aid in the design of the full-scale turbine . the model inputs include naca 0012 airfoil lift and drag coefficients , angles of attack and relative wind speeds as determined from a matlab program , and user inputs such as wind speed , tip speed ratio , overall blade and turbine dimensions , and power required . the model outputs forces and torques produced over a wide range of tsr . the model also uses various angles of attack to determine performance results when pitching is used . analysis results indicated that passive pitching is an affecting way to boost the turbines ability to selfstart . however , the naca 0012 profile was unable to achieve self-starting status , as it

ii

does not have large lift coefficients at low reynolds numbers . it was concluded that a profile with large lift at low speeds used along with passive pitching could achieve selfstarting status . as a result , three blade profiles will be tested and compared over the holiday break in the wind tunnel facility at dalhousie university . results from prototype testing in the wind tunnel will reveal the blade profile that offers the best performance for self-starting .

the full-scale vawt will be approximately 10ft tall , with a blade height of 5ft , and a diameter of 8ft . three blades will be cnc machined from aluminum stock . the full-scale model will be built early next term to allow for adequate testing time .

to date the group has received $ 1000 from richard rachals , $ 600 from our client , the mechanical engineering department , and $ 864 left over from the previous year wind turbine design project . the primary expense of this project is the costs associated with cnc machining the three aluminum blades . other expenses include bearings , a generation unit , and materials . to cut down on costs , equipment from previous year design projects will be used where applicable .

introduction

with the recent surge in fossil fuels prices , demands for cleaner energy sources , and government funding incentives , wind turbines are becoming a more viable technology for electrical power generation . fortunately there is an abundance of wind energy to be harnessed . currently , horizontal axis wind turbines ( hawt ) dominate commercially over vertical axis wind turbines ( vawt ) . however , vawt do have some advantages over hawt .

1.1 horizontal versus vertical axis wind turbines
the hawt is the most common turbine configuration . the propellers and turbine mechanisms are mounted high above the ground on a huge pedestal . it is a matter of taste as to whether they enhance the landscape . however , there is no denying that the height at which their mechanisms are located is a disadvantage when servicing is required . also , they require a mechanical yaw system to orient them such that their horizontal axis is perpendicular to and facing the wind . as potential power generation is related to the swept area ( diameter ) of the rotor , more power requires a larger diameter . the blades experience large thrust and torque forces , so size is limited by blade strength . figure 1.0 shows ge wind energy ’ s 3.6 megawatt hawt . larger wind turbines are more efficient and cost effective .

figure 1.0. ge wind energy ’ s 3.6 megawatt hawt . [ ref,1 ]

a vawt does not need to be oriented into the wind and the power transition mechanisms can be mounted at ground level for easy access . figure 1.1 shows a picture of an h-darrius rotor vawt .

figure 1.1. an h-darrius rotor vawt . [ ref,2 ]

the perceived disadvantage of the vawt is that they are not self-starting . however , it could be argued that the hawt is also not self-starting since it requires a yaw mechanism for orientation . currently , vawt are usually rotated automatically until they reach the ratio between blade speed and undisturbed wind speed ( tip speed ratio or tsr ) that produces a torque large enough to do useful work . through the use of drag devices and/or variable pitch blade designs , it is hoped that a vawt will be able to reach the required tsr without the use of a starter .

1.2 how wind energy is harnessed
turbines relying on drag , such as the anemometer and savonius models , can not spin faster than the wind blows and are thus limited to a tsr of less than 1. other turbines , such as the darrieus , rely on lift to produce a positive torque . lift type wind turbines can experience tsr as high as 6. this is possible because the natural wind is vector summed with the wind opposing the forward velocity of the airfoil . this combined velocity is known as the relative wind .

1.3 how turbines work
the wind imposes two driving forces on the blades of a turbine ; lift and drag . a force is produced when the wind on the leeward side of the airfoil must travel a greater distance than that on the windward side . the wind traveling on the windward side must travel at a greater speed than the wind traveling along the leeward side . this difference in velocity creates a pressure differential . on the leeward side , a low-pressure area is created , pulling the airfoil in that direction . this is known as the bernoulli ’ s principle . lift and drag are the components of this force vector perpendicular to and parallel to the apparent or relative wind , respectively . by increasing the angle of attack , as shown in figure 1.2 , the distance that the leeward air travels is increased . this increases the velocity of the leeward air and subsequently the lift . the bernoulli principle is illustrated in figure 1.3 .

3

figure 1.2. force vectors for a hawt . [ ref,9 ]

4

figure 1.3. effects of angle of attack on lift . [ ref,4 ]

lift and drag forces can be broken down into components that are perpendicular ( thrust ) and parallel ( torque ) to their path of travel at any instant . the torque is available to do useful work , while the thrust is the force that must be supported by the turbine ’ s structure .

1.4 turbine size as a function of power required .
the power of the wind is proportional to air density , area of the segment of wind being considered , and the natural wind speed . the relationships between the above variables are provided in equation [ 1 ] below [ ref , 10 ] .

5

pw = ½ ρau3 where pw : power of the wind ( w ) ρ : air density ( kg/m3 ) a : area of a segment of the wind being considered ( m2 ) u : undisturbed wind speed ( m/s )

[ 1 ]

at standard temperature and pressure ( stp = 273k and 101.3 kpa ) , equation [ 1 ] reduces to : pw = 0.647au3 [ 2 ]

a turbine can not extract 100 % of the winds energy because some of the winds energy is used in pressure changes occurring across the turbine blades . this pressure change causes a decrease in velocity and therefore usable energy . the mechanical power that can be obtained from the wind with an ideal turbine is given as : pm = ½ ρ ( 16/27 au3 ) where pm : mechanical power ( w ) in equation [ 3 ] , the area , a , is referred to as the swept area of a turbine . for a vawt , this area depends on both the turbine diameter and turbine blade length . for an h-type vawt the equation for swept area is :

[ 3 ]

as = dt lb where as : swept area ( m2 ) dt : diameter of the turbine ( m ) lb : length of the turbine blades ( m )

[ 4 ]

6

the constant 16/27 = 0.593 from equation [ 3 ] is referred to as the betz coefficient . the betz coefficient tells us that 59.3 % of the power in the wind can be extracted in the case of an ideal turbine . however , an ideal turbine is a theoretical case . turbine efficiencies in the range of 35-40 % are very good , and this is the case for most large-scale turbines . it should also be noted that the pressure drop across the turbine blades is very small , around 0.02 % of the ambient air pressure .

equation [ 3 ] can be re-written as

pm = cp pw where cp : coefficient of performance .

[ 5 ]

the coefficient of performance depends on wind speed , rotational speed of the turbine and blade parameters such as pitch angle and angle of attack . the pitch angle for a hawt is the angle between the blades motion and the chord line of the blade , whereas for a vawt the pitch angle is between the line perpendicular to the blades motion and the chord line of the blade . the angle of attack is the angle between the relative wind velocity and the centerline of the blade . for fixed pitch turbines , these angles do not change and the cp is directly related to the tsr . see table 1 for typical cp values for various types of wind turbines .

example calculation 1.0 : if we take the average wind speed to be 6 m/s ( 5-7 m/s for halifax ) , and consider a turbine 2.5m in diameter and 1.5m high , the power of the wind is , pw = 0.647 ( 2.5m ) ( 1.5m ) ( 6m/s ) 3 = 524 ( w ) however , we know from the betz coefficient that pw can not be obtained . using a cp = 0.1 ( 10 % efficiency ) and the value of pw ( 524 w ) calculated above , we can see that for a 2.5m x 1.5m turbine in 6 m/s wind at stp , the mechanical power realized is : pm = 0.1 ( 524w ) = 52.4 w these equations can also be used to calculate the frontal area required from the output power required , wind speed , and the efficiency estimate . then , the linear dimensions needed to support that frontal area are calculated . generally , for both the eggbeater darrieus and the straight–blade design , the height roughly equals the diameter .

1.5 turbine solidity as a function of tsr
the operating tip–speed ratio ( tsr ) for a darrieus rotor lies between 4 and 6. this design tsr then determines the solidity , gear ratios , generator speeds , and structural design of the rotor . using this tsr and the graph in figure 1.4 , a value of the solidity is selected . as with the prop–type rotor , the solidity allows for the calculation of blade area . solidity times the rotor frontal area gives the total blade area . dividing the total blade area by the number of blades ( usually 2 or 3 ) gives the individual blade area . the individual blade area divided by the rotor height gives the chord length [ ref,3 ] .

1.6 chosen sizing and discussion
the dimensions for the vawt being built for this project are given in table 1.1. the diameter ( 2.56 m ) is larger than the height ( 1.5m ) to provide a longer chord length for the same solidity . this design selection provides an increased reynolds number for the flow over the blades , and subsequently , increases the lift . also , given the large thrust forces involved , a shorter airfoil length will be less likely to undergo bend .

design process – engineering analysis model

self-starting is the major obstacle to be overcome for successful design of a vawt . it has been suggested [ ref,5 ] that pitching the turbine blades such that the pitch angle is not 90 degrees allows for self-starting . to understand the physics surrounding pitching , an in depth engineering analysis was carried out for a common airfoil profile , naca 0012. performance data and characteristics for the symmetric naca 0012 airfoil are available for analysis as the airfoil is commonly used in various applications . the next series of paragraphs explain the steps involved in the engineering analysis of the naca 0012 airfoil with various pitching arrangements .

4.1 model inputs
a model was assembled so that various inputs were used to influence and generate desired outputs that described the turbines performance . the model is excel based , with a matlab program for calculating additional information . the design team created the model to produce desired outputs from available inputs , and to avoid conducting repetitions and lengthy calculations by hand .

model inputs were primarily controlled by a sizing spreadsheet as shown in table 4.0. the key inputs of the sizing spreadsheet include tsr , and solidity , as solidity has effects on the chord length and blade height of the airfoil . the wind speed was kept constant throughout the engineering analysis at the average wind speed value for nova scotia of 6m/s .

13

table 4.0. sizing spreadsheet for model inputs . inputs undisturbed wind speed 6 m/s density of air 1.204 kg/m3 viscosity of air 1.81e-05 ns/m2 tsr 4 solidity 0.15 number of airfoils 3 blade height 1.50 m power required 50 watts estimated coefficient of 0.1 performance

another model input was the naca 0012 airfoil lift and drag coefficients , [ ref,6 ] . these coefficients were supplied for various reynolds numbers , and were input into the model as a lookup table . naca 0012 lift and drag coefficients are supplied in appendix a .

the primary objective of the engineering analysis model was to understand the effects of blade pitching . therefore , pitch angles were another required input for the model . it is known that during high rotational speeds , the most efficient operation of the turbine occurs when the pitch angle is zero , or stated another way ; the angle of attack is 90 º. as a result , blade pitching is only necessary during start up when large torques are needed . a range of pitch angles was chosen for the model analysis to determine how different angles affected performance . the range was input into the model as angles of attack that would be added to a pitch angle of 90º , and included angles of attack of -10 , -5 , -2 , 0 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 12 , 15 , and 17. these 10 angles of attack resulted in pitch angles ranging from 80º to 107º . the reason for not choosing larger or smaller pitch angles was that eventually the blade would have to return to 90º . angles further from the range chosen would involve a large angle change and would likely induce turbulent flow over the airfoil .

14

4.2 model calculations
after the inputs are specified , the next step of the analysis involves calculations . the first calculation was to determine the reynolds number associated with the flow over the airfoils . the equation for reynolds number is given below as

re = where re : reynolds number w : wind speed ( m/s ) tsr : tip speed ratio

w × tsr × ρ air × cl

υair

[ 6 ]

ρair : density of air ( kg/m3 )
cl : chord length ( m )

ν air : viscosity of air ( ns/m2 )
because the turbine is spinning about a central shaft , the wind speed that the blades experience is not equal to the ambient wind speed . the angle of attack of the turbine blades is continuously changing throughout the blades ’ 360º revolution . as a result , the magnitude of the relative wind speed changes throughout rotation , and is the parameter used to calculate the reynolds number as given in equation [ 6 ] . because the relative wind speed changes for each degree of the 360º revolution , and also changes for different values of tsr , it would be monotonous to carry out the calculations for relative wind speed by hand . to avoid iterative calculations , a matlab program was written to automatically calculate the angles of attack and the relative wind speeds for a specified tsr throughout the revolution of 0º to 360º . the matlab program was only able to output angles of attach and relative wind speeds for one tsr ; therefore , the program had to be run numerous times to obtain angles of attack and relative wind speeds for tsr ranging from 0.25 through to 7. the matlab output file was converted to an excel file

15

and added to the analysis model . the matlab code for the mentioned programs is provided in appendix c .

the model used the relative wind speed as specified by matlab to calculate the reynolds number as given by equation [ 6 ] . after the reynolds number is calculated , the lift and drag coefficients can be obtained from the naca 0012 coefficients look up tables . however , lift and drag coefficients are dependant on the reynolds number and the angle of attack . to calculate the angle of attack , the angle specified from the matlab program is added to the desired blade pitching angle of attack , as specified in the model inputs . because there are ten angles of attack being considered for the pitching analysis , it is necessary to carry out all calculations for ten scenarios . once the actual angle of attack is determined , the model uses the reynolds number along with the angle to lookup the appropriate lift and drag coefficients . when the lift and drag coefficients are determined , the lift and drag forces can be calculated using the following equations , respectively .

fl =

1 ρ airw 2 × cl × bl × cl 2 1 fd = ρ airw 2 × cl × bl × cd 2

[ 7 , 8 ]

where fl : lift force ( n ) fd : drag force ( n ) bl : blade length ( m ) cl : lift coefficient cd : drag coefficient the lift and drag forces were then resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the blades ’ path of rotation . the following four equations were used to resolve the lift and drag forces into parallel and perpendicular components .

α actual : angle of attack with added pitching ( rad )
finally , parallel forces are added , and perpendicular forces are added to obtain expressions for f1 and f2 , as given by equations [ 8 ] and [ 9 ] .

f1 = fl , help − fd , hurt f2 = fl , circ + fd , circ

[ 13 , 14 ]

where f1 : forces contributing to torque ( n ) f2 : centrifugal forces ( n ) the resulting forces , f1 and f2 , are the forces experienced by a turbine with one blade rotating about a central axis . to obtain the forces experienced by a turbine with 2 blades , the forces are split at 180º and doubled . for example , the forces experienced by the first

17

blade at 90º are the same forces to be experienced by the 2nd blade at 270º . this was also done for a 3-blade turbine ; however , the forces were split at 120º , and added three times .

as mentioned previously , there are ten angles of attack considered for this analysis . as a result , the above analysis was carried out for each angle to be considered , and also for tsr ranging from 0.25 to 7. this range of tsr coverage provided a complete picture of how pitching effects turbine performance from start up to high rotational speeds .

4.3 model outputs
the major results from the engineering analysis model are stated below . graphs are used to illustrate key points .

4.3.1 number of blades
before choosing a final vawt design , it was necessary to determine the number of blades the turbine would have . for a 2-blade turbine , there are times when both blades are in a position such that the wind does not encourage rotation . this is known as the stall position . for a 3-blade turbine , the stall condition is eliminated . this is a conceptual reasoning ; however , the analysis model was used to test this conceptual reasoning . the original analysis in the model determined the overall forces for a one-bladed turbine . these forces were easily manipulated to represent overall forces for a 2 and 3-blade turbine . the results showed that the 2-blade turbine generally produces a smaller average f1 than the 3-bladed design . for a 90º pitch angle , there are tsr ranges where the 2blade design produces larger f1 than the 3-blade ; however , because the blades can be pitched at this low tsr range , and pitched blades produce a more favorable f1 result , it is noted that the 3-blade design is still superior to the 2-blade design . as a result , the 3blade design was chosen for the full scale vawt design . figures 4.0 through 4.3 illustrate the torque producing forces , f1 , experienced by 2 and 3-bladed turbines for tsr of 0.25 , 1 , 2 and 3. the pitch angle for figures 4.0 through 4.3 is kept constant at 90º so that the only variable among the figures is the tsr . figures 4.4 though 4.7 illustrate the

18

f1 forces experience by 2 and 3-blade designs at tsr of 0.25 , 1 , 2 , and 3 as well ; however , figures 4.4 through 4.7 are taken at pitch angles other than 90º . it is noted that at tsr below 3 , the optimal pitch angle ( the pitch angle producing the largest f1 ) , is 107º , while at tsr higher than 3 have optimal pitch angles closer to 90º .

4.3.2 active pitching
active pitching involves the use of a mechanism or actuator to pitch the blades at various instances about the blades 360˚ revolution such that the maximum f1 is obtained throughout the entire revolution . as mentioned previously , the angle of attack continuously changes throughout the 360º revolution of the blades around the turbine shaft . as a result , the optimal pitch angle continuously changes . in some instances , the optimal angle of attack changes in as little as 10º of blade revolution . note that the optimal angle of attack is defined as the angle of attack that gives the largest f1 . physically changing the pitch angles every 5º or 10º of revolution is not physically possible , especially at high rotational speeds . also , the optimal angles of attack sometimes vary between as low as 85º to as high as 105º in 5º of revolution . this is highly impractical , not only in the physical sense , but also because it would disturb the

23

flow over the airfoil , causing turbulent flow and therefore not generating a continuous or steady lift force . figure 4.8 shows f1 fluctuations about the 360º revolution for 5 different pitch angles at a tsr of 0.75. it is clear from figure 4.8 that when certain pitch angles are at a low f1 value , other pitch angles achieve high f1 . table 4.1 shows the pitch angles that produce the maximum f1 for every 5º of revolution . it can be seen from table 4.1 that the pitch angle varies very frequently , which would relate to a constantly moving blade .

it is possible ; however , to choose two pitch angles such that one angle is optimal while the other is not , and vice-versa . if this can be done , and if the two pitch angles are within a close range to each other , it could be practical to vary the pitch angle between these two angles during the blades ’ revolution . figure 4.9 shows the average f1 for all ten pitch

25

angle inputs , at a tsr of 0.75. pitch angles of 107º and 105º achieve the largest average f1 values throughout their 360º revolution , as shown in figure 4.9. as a result , it would be practical to vary the pitch angle from 105º to 107º degrees to maximize turbine performance .

figure 4.9. average f1 for pitch angles of 80º through 107º for a tsr of 0.75. to achieve this varying pitch , a mechanical device such as an actuator would be required . as our design requirements specify that a self-starting turbine with no external power sources will be fabricated , the outside power source needed to run the actuators would violate the design requirements . as a result of the active pitching analysis , it is concluded that continuously varying the pitching angle is , in many cases , not a practical solution to achieve self-starting .

the idea of passive pitching is that an initial pitch angle other than 90º is set with a spring , and when the turbine reaches a certain rotational speed , the forces from the blade pull on the spring , extending it such that the blades achieve a pitch angle of 90º , again , to achieve maximum performance . results from the analysis model were used to determine what pitch angle would be optimal before the turbine reached a desired speed where the blades could return to 90º . from the analysis , it was determined that a pitch angle of 107 degrees provides the largest average torques over the range of tsr from 0.25 to 2.25. a printout of the model results for various pitch angles from a tsr range of 0.25 , to 7 are provided numerically in appendix b. these tables present the overall performance of difference pitch angles at difference tsr , and they clearly show that the pitch angle of 107º is optimal for tsr below 2.25. the naca 0012 , however , experiences very low torques around a tsr of 2 , which represents the ‘ deadband ’ phenomenon . although the torques produced in this tsr range are positive , they are only slightly positive . after a tsr of 2.25 , the maximum average torque is obtained with pitch angles close to 88-90 degrees . again , these results are shown in the tables in appendix b .

4.4 analysis conclusions
as a result of the engineering analysis carried out for the naca 0012 airfoil at various pitch angles , it was shown that the ‘ deadband ’ phenomenon could be overcome , but only slightly . to overcome the ‘ deadband ’ with a level on confidence , torques in the tsr range of 0.75 to 2.75 must be increased to values further above zero . to achieve this , an airfoil with high lift coefficients at low reynolds numbers is needed . it has been suggested that both the naca 4415 [ ref,7 ] and the naca 0018 [ ref,8 ] experience these characteristics . the naca 0018 , another symmetric airfoil , has a fatter profile than the naca 0012 , while the naca 4415 is a cambered airfoil , meaning that the airfoil has a curved shape rather than a symmetric one . cambered blades are also thought to experience better performance on small-scale turbines because the backwash from the blades is aimed in the direction of successive blade travel . the team was unable to find

27

evidence to prove that the naca 0018 and 4415 experience larger lift coefficients than the naca 0012 at low reynolds numbers . however , data was found for the naca 0018 and 4415 for high reynolds numbers , and the trends in lift coefficients showed larger values than the naca 0012 experiences at the same high reynolds number . although it is thought that these lift coefficient trends may continue into lower reynolds numbers , it is not known for certain . as the mentioned airfoils are usually used in applications with fast wind speeds , the area of vawt self-starting is fairly new so there is not a lot of information available for low speed applications such as this . to determine which profile has the best performance at low speeds , prototype testing will be carried out with the three profiles as a means to compare performance data . results from the prototype testing will be used to determine which profile will be used for the full-scale model vawt .

5.1 base
the base from previous year design projects will be reused for our project . the existing steel base will be modified with a steel connecting bracket and plywood base extension . the base components are discussed below .

5.1.1 steel base
we plan to use the base from previous years design projects , with a few modifications . the base is steel and stands approximately 3 feet high and weighs roughly 70 lbs , as shown in figure 5.1. on its own the base will not support the torque and moments produced from our wind turbine , so a base extension and a connecting bracket will be required . a cad drawing of the steel base is shown in appendix d .

5.1.2 plywood base extension
to modify the base , we are going to purchase 4 sheets of 4 ’ x 8 ’ x ¾ ” plywood to construct a base extension that will give us a larger footprint on which to place weights . a cad drawing is provided in appendix d. for our purposes , we have determined that sandbags will be the optimal blend between weight , cost effectiveness , and transportability . the plywood sheets will be oriented with 2 sheets side-by-side , with 2 other sheets on top at 90 degrees rotation to the bottom 2 sheets . reinforced 8 ’ x 8 ’ base . this creates a

5.2.3 steel connecting bracket
to connect the 4 sheets of plywood to the steel base we will use a bottom bracket made of 1/8 ” x 2 ½ ” steel , as shown in appendix d. this bottom bracket will be bolted from the bottom up through the sheets of plywood and up through the steel base . this 36 ” x 36 ” structure will provide quick assembly and disassembly of the turbine base structure . the bottom bracket will require 4 simple corner welds and flat head bolts welded in position that will encourage quick assembly .

31

5.2 shaft
the shaft from existing design projects will be used for our project . to minimize weight , the 69 ½ ” , 1 ½ ” diameter section of the shaft will be milled down to 1 3/8 ” to make the shaft uniform and to reduce weight . the existing shaft can be seen in figure 5.2 , and a cad drawing of the shaft , showing the section to be milled , is provide in appendix d .

32

figure 5.2. existing shaft from previous year design project .

5.3 bearings
minimizing required start-up torque is essential for the wind turbine to self-start and thus , the success of our project . without proper bearings our wind turbine will either not operate properly , or ruin the bearings that were used improperly , which could result in unsafe operating conditions . the bearings that were used in previous years wind turbine design projects , shown in figure 5.3 , are inferior units that are not salvageable . bearings can be very expensive , and for our particular setup we will require 2 roller bearings that are going to primarily centralize the shaft , and a turntable bearing to take the majority of the weight . this combination will provide the least amount of friction , while maximizing bearing life and maintaining safe operating conditions .

33

figure 5.3. bearings from previous year design project .

5.4 center mounts
in order to connect the radial arms and the turbine blades to the center shaft , there needs to be a strong connection that will withstand the centrifugal and inertial forces caused by the rotation of the wind turbine . the center shaft mount , machined from aluminum , will slide over the end of the shaft and will be fastened with setscrews , enabling quick assembly and disassembly . the three radial arms will be bolted into the center mount via female clamps at 120 degree angles of separation . this will be a one-piece unit , designed using finite element analysis , to minimize weight and to reduce the possibility of failure . a cad drawing of the center mounts is provided in appendix d .

34

5.5 radial connecting arms
aluminum will be used for the six radial connecting arms to maintain a lightweight assembly with minimal inertial , moment , and centrifugal forces . the connecting arms provide a means to mount the blades to the center mounts and thus the center shaft . there will be two 3/8 ” bolts connecting each arm to the center mounts , while a pivoting device allows the blade to pitch on the opposite end . the arms will be purchased as ½ ” x 1 ½ ” and may need to be cut to the appropriate 4 ’ lengths . the arm edges will be rounded to reduce drag . a cad drawing of the radial arms is provided in appendix d .

5.6 airfoils
selecting appropriate airfoils for our 3-bladed vertical axis wind turbine is one of the most important design decisions . different profiles provide various advantages and disadvantages that must be considered . wind tunnel prototype testing results will provide information that will be used to choose the optimal blade profile for a self-starting application . once a profile is selected , 3 blades will be cnc machined from aluminum flat-bar into an accurate representation of the selected airfoil . the estimated weight of each aluminum airfoil is 22 lbs . the top and bottom of each blade will be a 1 ” x 5 ” x 1 ” deep rectangular section to allow for easier connections to the radial arms and passive pitching system . a cad drawing of the airfoils is provided in appendix d .

5.7 blade connecting assembly
the blade connecting assembly will be used to connect the blades to the radial arms . the current design is to drill a 3/8 ” hole through the radial arm , and also into the blade to a depth of 3 ” . a steel dowel will be used for the connection . a washer and bushing will be located between the connecting arm and the top of the blade , and a set screw cap will

35

secure the blade to the radial connecting arm . assembly is provided in figure 5.4 .

5.8 pitching device
pitching the turbine blades is thought to improve turbine performance characteristics . the following pitch design has been discussed ; however , our chosen blade pitching design will be determined in early january .

5.8.1 linear spring / slotted bracket pitch system
for this design , a linear spring will be connected to the radial arm . it will initially be in compression when the turbine is at rest , pulling the pointed end of the airfoil towards the center of the turbine . as the turbine begins to rotate , the centrifugal forces will apply tension to the spring , and the blade will gradually be let out . this design will be used in 36

conjunction with a slotted bracket to ensure that the blade pitches between the desired pitch angles . figure 5.5 shows the linear spring pitching design , while figure 5.6 shows the slotted bracket . the first diagram in figure 5.5 shows the start-up blade orientation , set at the optimal pitch angle of 107˚ . as the tsr increases , the centrifugal forces increase . when the tsr reaches 3 , the centrifugal force will be enough such that the force causes the spring to extend until the pitch angle is 90˚ . also incorporated into the linear spring pitch design will be a stop mechanism such that the blade is not able to rotate to a pitch angle smaller than 90˚ . this stop will be designed such that the forces on the blade while it is in the 90˚ position will not be held by the spring . the stopping device will also be used to withstand the centrifugal forces for this condition .

5.8.2 pitch control bracket to manipulate the pitch angle
for this design , three pitching control brackets will be machined from aluminum as seen in figure 14. these brackets will be bolted to the top radial arms and will have a series of holes drilled to correspond to different pitching angles . the blade will have a pin in the top to align with the bracket holes . the slotted bracket is shown in figure 5.6 .

status

testing will be the major factor that determines the blade profile for the full-scale turbine . currently , there are plans to test three different blade profiles that were selected based on high reynolds number performance characteristics . the three blade profiles are

naca 0012 naca 0018 naca 4415

the existing three blade h-type vawt set-up from last years wind turbine tester design project will be used for testing , as it has already been designed for use with the university ’ s wind tunnel and torque transducer . the existing 3-blade h-type vawt prototype can be seen in figure 6.0 , and the wind tunnel is shown in figure 6.1. due to the three blade profiles , modifications to existing support arms shown in figure 6.2 will be required . alterations will involve removal of the rounded end portion of the supports , and the existing holes may have to be drilled again . the group plans to contact stewart carr to perform this work . the test blades will be made from clear pine , using a table saw to cut out a rough profile for each blade shape . albert murphy has volunteered to do this work . the profiles will then be sanded by hand and painted with oil based paint to obtain a smooth profile . figure 6.3 shows the naca 0012 wooden blade profile before sanding and painting . each set of blades will be manufactured from one piece of pine , then cut to their appropriate 1 ’ lengths , in an effort to make each set of blades as uniform as possible . the blades will be bolted to the supports and a series of nuts will be used to position them radially and vary the pitch angle .

once the results of the tests are known , the blade profile with the best results will be chosen for use in the full-scale version of the turbine .

conclusions

the first part of the design process , which included research , brainstorming , engineering analysis , and turbine design selection was completed during the fall term . the initial research and analysis portion of the project provided its share of complications ; however , once completed it provided valuable information about the final design . to date , the major components of the turbine have been settled on , in particular , full-scale aluminum blades have been chosen , and will be machined in the cnc lab at dalhousie . there are still some final design options that must be finalized , and these decisions will be made before turbine construction begins in early january .

testing will be a major part of the design selection , as blade profile selection will occur over the christmas break based on prototype testing results . the test results should provide insight as to which blade profile provides the most torque and shows the most significant effects due to blade pitching . in addition to prototype testing , finite element analysis will be performed on each blade profile in an effort to confirm the wind tunnel results . the blade connectors and pitching system designs will also be finalized , and a spring selection for the passive pitching system will be made . a device used to couple the torque transducer and generator to the shaft will be designed as well . this will occur in conjunction with the selection of a generator , and design of a device that would couple the generator to the turbine after it reaches a certain rotational speed . the last item to be decided on is a brake mechanism that must be incorporated into the design for safety reasons . these items will be decided on before issuing of the second build report in january .

construction of the full-scale turbine will begin during the first week of the winter term , with the goal of finishing the final product by the end of february . this will allow for a month of testing and data analysis , as well as provide time for making any design alterations that are needed . a project timeline for the second term can be seen in the gantt chart in appendix e. based on current progress , the group is confident that the final product will meet all the requirements set out in the fall term .

45

finally , the group will like to thank dr. murat koksal and dr. larry hughes for their ongoing guidance , as well as the mechanical engineering department technicians for their help with prototype testing . thanks are also extended to richard rachals and the mechanical engineering department for their donations to the project .

introduction

wind power plants are generally used to convert wind energy into electrical energy . these plants consist of a wind turbine and an electrical generator connected by means of a gear box . the wind turbine converts wind kinetic energy into mechanical energy and the latter into electrical energy by means of the electrical generator . these plants are controlled by an appropriate control system . the ﬂow ﬁeld around a wind turbine is unsteady and three-dimensional . mathematical models for such complex ﬂows are available in the literature . they may be divided into momentum , vortex , and ﬁnite-difference models . the momentum models use actuator surfaces to approximate wind-turbine effects and subdivide the ﬂow domain into a ﬁnite number of stream-tubes ( wilson and lisseman , 1974 ; strickland , 1975 ; shankar , 1976 ; templin , 1974 ; lapin , 1975 ; paraschivoiu , 1981 ; loth and mccoy , 1983 ; fortunato and de martino , 1989 ) . vortex models simulate the wind-turbine blades and use bounded , distributed vortices ( brown , 1991 ; wilson et al . , 1976 ; holme , 1976 ; wilson , 1978 ; fanucci and walters , 1976 ; strickland et al . , 1979 ; wilson and walker , 1975 , 1983 ; wilson et al . , 1983 ) . finally , ﬁnite difference models solve the ﬂuid-dynamic governing equations by means of ﬁnite-volume or ﬁnite-difference methods ( chviaropoulos and papailiou , 1988 ; rajagopalan and fanucci , 1985 ; fortunato et al . , 1995 ; rajagopalan et al . , 1995 ) . to regulate these wind power plants , a control system must yield an asymptotic reduction of the disturbances in order to minimize the differences between the actual and reference values

of the output voltage and frequency . applications to wind-power plants of open-loop ( steinbuch , 1986 ) and closed-loop ( madsen , 1988 ; sandhu and dias , 1988 ) classical control techniques can be found in the literature . in the present paper we propose the estimator-based adaptive fuzzy logic ( eafl ) control , which represents an innovative type of adaptive fuzzy logic control system ( mendel , 1995 ; andersen et al . , 1997 ) . the eafl controller continuously optimizes the internal parameters of the fuzzy logic rule base , in order to adapt these parameters to the system-dynamic behavior ( mendel , 1995 ; andersen et al . , 1997 ) . indeed , starting from a ﬁrst glance fuzzy logic rule base , the eafl minimizes a cost function in order to adapt the fuzzy controller parameters to the controlled wind system . this control technique employs a gradient descent algorithm to minimize the cost function which is based on the control error estimated one step ahead . such errors are estimated by using the least square algorithm ( lsa ) in recursive form ( goodwin and sin , 1984 ; dambrosio , 1994 ; dadone et al . , 1998 ) . the eafl requires the observability of the controlled plant , while it does not require any a priori knowledge of its deterministic model . in the present paper , instead of a real wind plant , a numerically simulated wind system is considered . in particular , a rather simple momentum model for the wind turbine is adopted , while a complete dynamic model of the rotor and stator windings of the induction generator is employed ( fitzgerald et al . , 1992 ) . taking into account that the power plant is assumed to be an isolated power source , the disturbances here considered are the wind speed variability and the external load changes . obviously , the eafl has to counterbalance such disturbance variables in order to control the system outputs represented by the voltage and by the rotational speed of the self-excited induction generator . the required control is obtained by acting on the control variables , which are assumed to be the resistance of the induction generator rotor windings ( fitzgerald et al . , 1992 ) and the transmission ratio of the gear box . in the next sections , the mathematical models of the horizontal wind turbine and of the induction electrical generator are ﬁrst outlined . next , the fuzzy logic system and the estimatorbased adaptive fuzzy logic control technique are described . finally , some results of the application of the eafl control algorithm to the numerically modelled wind system are presented .

2 model of the horizontal-axis wind turbine
the mathematical model of a horizontal-axis wind turbine here employed is based on the stream-tube discretization ( wilson and lisseman , 1974 ) . momentum conservation in both the axial and tangential directions is considered . the aerodynamic characteristics of the wind turbine blades are represented by the lift ( cl ) and drag ( cd ) coefﬁcients , which depend on the inﬂow angle . according to wilson and lisseman ( 1974 ) , the thrust and torque acting on a blade element dr , at a distance r from the center of the rotor , are given by cos φ cd 1+ tan φ dr , sin2 φ cl cd 1 sin φ dq = ρ π r2 σ ( 1 + a ) 2 ( ω r ) 2 cl 1− dr , 2φ cos cl tan φ dt = ρ π r σ ( 1 − a ) 2 v0 2 cl

( 1 )

where σ = ab /a is the solidity ratio , while a and ab are the rotor area and the total blade area , respectively . moreover , r , a , a , φ represent the air density , the axial and tangential induced velocity coefﬁcients , and the inﬂow angle , respectively . finally , ω is the rotor angular speed , and v0 is the undisturbed wind velocity . following eqs . ( 1 ) , the wind turbine torque , qt , and

p = q ω ,

where rmin , and rmax represent the internal and external rotor radii , respectively . the windturbine power coefﬁcient is evaluated from eq . ( 3 ) as cp = p . 1/2 ρ a v0 3 ( 4 )

in the present paper , we consider a three-blade horizontal-axis wind turbine . its external , rmax , and internal , rmin , rotor radii are 5 m and 0.5 m , respectively . the considered standard conditions are the following : v0 = 10 m/s ; p = 22 kw ; tip speed ratio λ = 7 , being λ = ω rmax /v0 . maximum power and maximum airfoil efﬁciency criteria have been adopted to design the outer section of the rotor blade , while the constant chord criterion has been used for its inner section . a naca 0012 airfoil proﬁle has been selected for the rotor blade and the corresponding analytical expressions for the lift and drag coefﬁcients have been taken from prouty ( 1986 ) .

mathematical model of the self-excited induction generator

the wind turbine drives a three phase self-excited induction generator . since the stator and rotor windings of the induction generator together with the external load are balanced , a perphase analysis can be adopted ( fitzgerald et al . , 1992 ) . accordingly , a ﬁxed axis reference system , dq , can be used to determine the governing equations of both the stator and rotor windings ( fitzgerald et al . , 1992 ) : v1d = r1 i1d + l1 v1q = r1 i1q 0 = r2 i2d 0 = r2 i2q d i1d dt d i1q + l1 dt d i2d + l2 dt d i2q + l2 dt + lm + lm + lm + lm d i2d , dt d i2q , dt d i1d + p ωg ( l2 i2q + lm i1q ) , dt d i1q − p ωg ( l2 i2d + lm i1d ) , dt

( 5 )

where r1 and r2 are the stator and rotor internal resistances , respectively , while l1 and l2 are the corresponding inductances . moreover , lm , ωg , and p represent the mutual inductance , the rotor angular speed , and the number of polar pairs , respectively . the voltages v1d , v1q and the currents i1d , and i1q have no direct physical meaning , although they are related to the phase voltages and currents , as it will be shown lately . being the external load represented by a capacity , c , an inductance , l , and a resistance , r ,

the corresponding governing equations in the dq system of reference are : v1d = l v1q d v1d dt d v1q c dt c d ild , dt d ilq = l , dt v1d = − − i1d − ild , rl v1q = − − i1q − ilq . rl

( 6 )

the dynamic equilibrium of the moving parts of both the wind turbine and the induction generator can be expressed as : d ωg 1 qt = − qe , ( 7 ) dt j τ where j represents the moment of inertia of all the rotating parts , referred to the electrical generator shaft , while τ and t are the transmission ratio of the gear box and the time . moreover , qe is the rotor electromagnetic torque given by : qe = 3 p ( i1d i2q + i1q i2d ) . ( 8 )

eqs . ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) represent a set of nine equations in the nine unknowns i1d , i1q , i2d , i2q , v1d , v1q , ild , ilq , e ωg , which can be solved , provided that the wind turbine torque is computed by means of eq . ( 2 ) . finally , the phase voltages can be obtained from the unphysical voltages v1d and v1q by means of the following relations : va = v1d , vb vb √ 3 1 v1q , = − v1d + 2 2 √ 1 3 v1q . = − v1d − 2 2 ( 9 )

fuzzy logic system

the fuzzy logic system ( fls ) employs a set of n fuzzy linguistic rules . these rules may be provided by experts or can be extracted from numerical data . in either cases , engineering rules in fls are expressed as a collection of if − then statements . therefore a fuzzy rule base r containing n fuzzy rules can be expressed as : r = [ rule1 , rule2 , ... , rulei , ... , rulen ] , where the i-th rule is : ˜ rulei : ifz ( k ) is a then u ( k ) is βi , where k refers to the variable values at time t = k ∆t . moreover , the vector z ( k ) = [ z1 ( k ) , ... , zl ( k ) ] t ( 12 ) ( 11 ) ( 10 )

represents all the l fuzzy inputs to the fls . on the other hand , u ( k ) represents the fuzzy output of the fls . in the antecedent of the i-th rule , the term ˜i ˜i ˜ a = [ a1 ... , al ] t ( 13 )

represents the vector of the fuzzy sets referring to the input fuzzy vector z ( k ) . the membership ˜ functions of both the input vector z ( k ) and the vector a of the fuzzy sets are gaussian , and assume the following expressions :
z µz j ( k ) = e−1/2 [ ( zj ( k ) −^j ) /σzj ] ,

will be shown , these parameters will be adapted to the controlled wind system by minimizing an appropriate cost function . the output of the fuzzy controller , u ( k ) , assumes the following expression ( mendel , 1995 ) :

is the value of the j-th input that maximizes eq . ( 16 ) . the maximization of eq .

in the next section , a procedure that allows an on-line adaptation of the parameters θ ( k ) to the controlled wind system will be introduced . the fuzzy logic control system adopted in the present paper is represented in fig . 1. the fuzzy input vector is deﬁned as : z ( k ) = [ y ( k − 1 ) , r ( k ) , u ( k − 1 ) ] t , ( 19 )

where y ( k ) is the output of the plant ( controlled variable ) , u ( k ) is the control variable ( output of the fuzzy controller ) , and r ( k ) represents a reference signal for y ( k ) .

estimator-based adaptive fuzzy logic

in general , an adaptive fuzzy logic ( afl ) control starts from an initially assumed set of parameters θ ( 0 ) , whose only requirement is to stabilize the plant . then , at each time step , the afl control adapts the set of parameters θ ( k ) , in order to minimize the cost function : j ( k ) = where ey ( k ) is the control error deﬁned as : ey ( k ) = r ( k ) − y ( k ) . ( 21 ) 1 2 e ( k ) , 2 y ( 20 )

the control error ey ( k ) can be determined only if a deterministic model of the controlled system is available . in the present paper , we suppose that no a priori deterministic model of the controlled system is available . the estimator-based adaptive fuzzy logic ( eafl ) control here suggested allows to solve this class of problems . indeed , instead of deriving the appropriate change in each internal parameter from the control error ey ( k ) , the eafl refers to an approximate estimation of the control error ey ( k ) = r ( k ) − y ( k ) , ^ ^ ( 22 ) and to the corresponding cost function : 1 ^ j ( k ) = e2 ( k ) . ^ 2 y ( 23 )

in eq . ( 22 ) , y ( k ) represents the estimated value of the output at the time k , to be evaluated . ^ as stated in ( goodwin and sin , 1984 ) , the present system , can be expressed as follows : y ( k ) = ak y ( k − 1 ) + bk u ( k − 1 ) , ( 24 )

where ak and bk represent the time-varying coefﬁcients of model ( 24 ) . if the controlled plant is observable , then eq . ( 24 ) represents its model in state space notation . in such a case , the model coefﬁcients ak and bk are unknown . these coefﬁcients can be on-line estimated by applying the least square algorithm ( lsa ) in recursive form ( goodwin and sin , 1984 ; dambrosio , 1994 ; dadone et al . , 1998 ) . as a consequence , the basic scheme of the fuzzy control system has to ^ be modiﬁed as shown in fig . 2 , where the lsa estimator evaluates the coefﬁcients ak and bk . ^ assuming that such coefﬁcients do not change from the time k to the time k + 1 , the estimated

figure 2 : layout of the fuzzy control system . model of the controlled system one-step-ahead , i.e . , at time k + 1 , assumes the following expression : ^ y ( k + 1 ) = ak y ( k ) + bk u ( k ) , ^ ^ ( 25 ) which is the output of the lsa parameter estimator ( fig . 2 ) . the signal y ( k+1 ) is compared to the reference signal r ( k+1 ) and the difference determines ^ the modiﬁcation of the fuzzy controller parameters θ ( k ) . this is implemented by rewriting the cost function ^ at time k + 1 as : j 2 ^ + 1 ) = 1 r ( k + 1 ) − ak y ( k ) + bk u ( k ) ^ ^ . ( 26 ) j ( k 2 the minimization of the cost function ^ + 1 ) can be easily accomplished by using the gradient j ( k descent algorithm as follows : θ ( k ) = θ ( k − 1 ) − η ∂^ + 1 ) j ( k , ∂θ ( 27 )

results

in the computed application , we have considered a controlled system starting from rest . we have also assumed that the control system reaches a steady-state condition after a starting time interval . during such a steady-state time period , we have hypothesized that appropriate disturbances perturb the system status . the control system acts during the starting time interval in order to guarantee the required time sequence of the system status . moreover , during the steady-state time period , the control system has to counteract the disturbance effects , in order to preserve the desired steady-state conditions . the aimed target is to control the output voltage and the rotational speed of the induction generator . the control variables are the rotor resistance , r2 , and the transmission ratio , τ , of the gear box connecting the wind turbine to the induction generator . in the presently considered control case , the system disturbances are represented by abrupt changes of the wind velocity and of the resistance load . in particular , we have assumed that the wind velocity instantaneously changes from 10 m/s to 11 m/s at time t=150 s , while it instantaneously returns to the original value at t=170 s. as far as the resistance load disturbance is concerned , we have assumed an instantaneous change from 9 ω to 15 ω at t=170 s and an opposite variation at t=200 s. figure . 3 shows the time history of the rotational speed , ωg , of the induction generator , while fig . 4 presents the corresponding percentage control error , ∆ω % . in fig . 3 , dotted and solid lines represent the target and the actual rotational speed , respectively . a quick glance to such ﬁgures allows to state that the actual and the target angular speeds are practically coincident during the considered time interval with the obvious exception of small errors during the very ﬁrst part of the starting time interval . in particular , the disturbance effects , acting during the steady state time interval , appear to be effectively counteracted by the present control system . the only evidence of the disturbance actions is represented by the small spikes in fig . 4 ( ∆ω % < 0.2 % ) due to the instantaneous variation of the disturbance variables . figure . 5 shows the output voltage , v , while fig . 6 represents the corresponding percentage error , ∆v % . as shown in fig . 5 , the actual and the target output voltages are practically coincident for most of the considered time interval . nevertheless , signiﬁcant differences between the actual and the target voltages can be observed at the beginning of the starting period . such differences are due to the lack of the auto-excitation of the induction generator at the very beginning of the starting interval . obviously , such errors can not be suppressed by any control system . moreover , fig . 6 shows two signiﬁcant spikes , during the steady state time interval , which denote the voltage sensitivity to the instantaneous changes of the resistance load , while no practical effect of the instantaneous changes of the wind velocity can be noticed . finally , ﬁgures . 7 and 8 show the time variations of the control variables , i.e . , the gear box transmission ratio , τ , and the rotor resistance , r2 . these variables vary in accordance to the disturbances , in order to counterbalance their effects . such an important characteristic proves

the adaptive nature of the eafl control technique , which automatically tunes itself in order to take into account all the non-linearities and time-variances of the system under control . in particular , it adaptively annihilates the time delays of the system components . therefore , we can state that the eafl control system has the property of forcing a physical system characterized by inherently relevant time delays to promptly react to external disturbances .

conclusions

in the present paper , an estimator-based adaptive fuzzy logic ( eafl ) control technique is proposed . the eafl controller is used to control a wind system operating as an isolated electrical power generation station . the wind system is composed by an horizontal-axis three blade wind turbine connected to an electrical induction generator through a gear box . instead of a real wind system , a numerically simulated wind system is considered and the mathematical models of its components are presented . after a brief review of the fuzzy logic system , the estimator-based adaptive fuzzy logic controller is described . its main features are the onestep-ahead estimation of the control error and the on-line optimization of the fuzzy rule base parameters . it is noteworthy , that no a priori deterministic model of the controlled system is required . we apply the estimator-based adaptive fuzzy logic controller to control a wind system starting from rest and reaching a steady state condition , which is then perturbed by abrupt changes of the wind velocity and of the electric load . the proposed eafl technique controls the output voltage and the induction generator rotational speed in all the considered control case the eafl control system proves its ability to adequately control the output variables under the actions of relevant and abrupt disturbances . the control system automatically tunes itself in order to counterbalance all the non-linearities and timevariances of the system under control , thus proving its adaptive characteristic . in particular , it has the property to force a physical system characterized by inherently relevant time delays to promptly react to external disturbances .

introduction

1.1 background
wind energy is the fastest growing source of energy in the world today , with an average growth rate of nearly 30 % per year for the past 10 years . 1 the u.s. installed capacity surged 45 % in 2007 , now totaling more than 16,800 mw , which generates an estimated 48 billion kilowatt-hours ( kwh ) , enough to power 4.5 million homes . 2 for many utility companies , wind energy has become not only the renewable energy of choice , but also the least-cost option for new generation . with global warming , energy security , and rising fuel prices being main public concerns , it is feasible to assume that the growth of the wind energy industry will continue . however , it is still important to improve upon the technology in order to keep wind energy economically competitive with traditional and other renewable energy sources . this is done by lowering the cost of energy ( coe ) , which can be accomplished in a number of different ways . there are three independent variables that go into calculating the cost of energy ; the energy capture of the turbine over its lifetime , the capital cost of the turbine , and the operations and maintenance ( o & m ) costs . o & m costs can be further divided into scheduled and unscheduled costs . coe = lifetime energy capture capital cost + o & m cost
( eqn . 1 )

there are several different ways to lower the coe .

by simply looking at the

equation , one way is to make more reliable turbines , thereby reducing the downtime and o & m costs . another is to decrease the amount of materials or improve manufacturing techniques that would allow the capital cost to drop . technological advances to wind

13

turbines is becoming even more critical because capital costs are rising due to increasing raw material costs , high turbine demand , and increasing cost of energy inputs . another technique used to reduce the coe is by increasing the rotor diameter and turbine size ; this has been happening since the beginning of the commercial wind industry . a larger turbine can capture more energy throughout its lifetime , and although the cost of the turbine will increase and potentially o & m will increase as well , the coe has been able to decrease . significant growth of wind turbine size and weight over the past few decades has made it impossible to control turbines passively as they were controlled in the past . modern turbines rely on sophisticated control systems that assure safe and optimal operation under a variety of atmospheric conditions . as turbines grow in size , the structural and fatigue loads become more pronounced . implementing new and innovative load control techniques could decrease excessive loads , which affect the rotor and surrounding components . extreme structural and fatigue loads are key factors in turbine design and the reduction of these loads could create a significant decrease in turbine cost by reducing required materials , lessening scheduled and unscheduled maintenance , and improving overall turbine reliability . this engineering challenge , which is economically driven by the push to lower the coe , has led to intensive research around the globe to improve the techniques of controlling rotor power and loads . there are four areas that influence the control of rotor power and turbine loads for a given wind speed . they can all be addressed when analyzing the lift equation for a wind turbine blade .

the blade incidence angle , θ pitch , can be controlled by pitching the blades and/or by designing an aeroelastic twist into the blade . flow velocity is adjusted by using a variable-speed rotor , n , where n = rpm/60 . these two control techniques ( variable speed and blade pitch ) are implemented on most modern machines . variable diameter rotors , b , would allow control over the blade size and are being investigated as a means to increase energy capture and minimize loads during high winds . the fourth area , and the focus of this report , is the control of blade section aerodynamics , c lα and α o , by implementing active flow control ( afc ) methods . the remaining portion of this chapter discusses the developments in wind turbine control and introduces some new control methods . chapter 2 provides a general background on active flow control . in chapter 3 , the various active flow control devices are presented and discussed .

1.2 wind turbine control
turbine control can be divided into two categories , passive control and active control . a considerable amount of research has been performed in these two areas . passive techniques improve the turbine ’ s performance and/or reduce loads without external

15

energy expenditure .

examples of this include the yaw movement of a free-to-yaw

downwind rotor and aeroelastic blade twist . active control requires external energy , or auxiliary power . therefore , more in depth studies must be conducted to ensure that the increase in energy output can offset the external energy required for load control as well as the increase in turbine capital and o & m costs . some traditional methods of active control are rotor yaw , blade pitch , and variable-speed rotors . examples of advanced active flow control devices are trailingedge flaps , microtabs , and synthetic jets . these and other devices are discussed in detail in chapter 3 of this report . a flow chart showing the avenues of turbine control and some examples is shown in fig . 1-1 .

fig . 1-1 flow chart showing wind turbine load control techniques .

16

in general , the goal of wind turbine control is to balance the following requirements : 3 1. setting upper bounds on and limiting the torque and power experienced by the drive train , principally the low-speed shaft . 2. minimizing the fatigue life extraction from the rotor drive train and other structural components due to changes in wind direction , speed ( including gusts ) , and turbulence , as well as start-stop cycles of the wind turbine . 3. maximizing energy production . requirement # 2 is directly related to the loads experienced by the turbine during operation . the loads can be divided into two main categories : aerodynamic and

structural . 4 these loads are related by the aeroelastic coupling . the relative velocities around the blade sections influence the aerodynamic loads on the rotor . most of these loads occur in a periodic nature ( appearing in multiples of the rotor frequency ) but some stochastic components also exist . the contributing factors to these loads are horizontal or vertical wind shear , tower shadowing , turbulence , and yaw and tilt misalignment.4 in addition to the two main categories of loads , gravitational forces can also have an impact by producing periodic structural loading on the rotor blades . to minimize these loads , control systems should be able to reduce the fluctuations of the aerodynamic loads or add damping to the structural modes . 5 the immediate goal of the control strategy depends on the operating region of the turbine , which is determined by the wind speed . fig . 1-2 illustrates the four distinct operating regions .

17

fig . 1-2 typical power curve of a commercial wind turbine , showing the four operating regions .

in region i , the wind speed is too low for the turbine to generate power . region ii , also called the sub-rated power region , lies between the cut-in speed and rated speed . here the generator operates at below rated power . the theoretical shape of this curve reflects the basic law of power production , where power is proportional to the cube of the wind speed . in region iii , the power output is limited by the turbine ; this occurs when the wind is sufficient for the turbine to reach its rated output power . region iv is the period of stronger winds , where the power in the wind is so great that it could be detrimental to the turbine , so the turbine shuts down .

1.3 developments in wind turbine operation for load control
at the beginning of the commercial wind energy industry , turbine operation was simple . the turbines were small ( tens or hundreds of kws in rated power ) , operated at a constant speed and used passive methods ( stall control ) to regulate power . the turbines were equipped with rotor blades that were designed to intrinsically regulate the power using fixed-pitch designed to operate near optimal tip-speed in region ii . as the wind

18

speed increased , the angle of attack increased and the flow about the blade would begin to stall , thereby increasing drag and limiting the amount of absorbed power . the

simplicity of this control concept contributed to wind energy ’ s rapid success ; however , the evolution towards larger rotor blades soon made this control concept uneconomical . nowadays , most large turbines ( one to several mws in rated power ) use variablespeed rotors combined with active collective blade pitch to optimize energy yield and control loads . in region ii , turbines tend to operate at fixed pitch using variable rotor speed to maintain an optimal tip-speed ratio and maximize energy capture . in region iii , the rotor operates at near constant speed and the blades are pitched to maintain the torque within acceptable limits . the control of the blade pitch and rotor speed has not only led to greater power regulation , but also to lighter blade construction due to a lower load spectrum and a lighter gear box due to reduced torque peaks.4 difficulties arise in turbulent winds when excessive loading ( both extreme and fatigue loads ) occurs , which leads to premature wear on turbine components . using current technology , it is difficult to mitigate these loads ; pitching of the entire blade is too slow and variable rotor speed allows shedding for some of the high loads , but not all . the need to mitigate excessive loads has led to investigations of new methods of control .

1.4 investigations into new control methods
variable-speed rotors and collective pitch are not capable of handling oscillatory or fatigue loads . these loads occur as a result of rotor yaw errors , wind shear , wind upflow , shaft tilt , wind gusts , and turbulence in the wind flow . 6 more sophisticated control methods are needed to account for these loads . some methods that will be presented in

19

this report are advanced blade pitch control , blade twist control , variable diameter rotors , and any number of flow control devices . 1.4.1 advanced blade pitch control

1.4.1.1 description
pitching is the act of rotating each blade around its spanwise axis in order to change the effective angle of attack to the wind . it is used to limit the peak power , optimize rotor efficiency , and slow down the rotor . the traditional method of pitch control uses a collective mode , in which all blades are adjusted simultaneously . advanced methods of pitch control ( cyclic pitch and individual pitch ) are being investigated . these innovative concepts were first developed for the rotorcraft field and have been adapted to the wind industry . 7 cyclic pitch control varies the blade pitch angles with a phase shift of 120° to alleviate the load variations caused by rotor tilt and yaw errors , whereas individual pitch control adjusts the pitch angle of each individual blade independently . this method requires the measurement of the local inflow angle and relative flow velocity for each blade . the goal is to create two load-reducing systems ( collective pitch and individual pitch ) that are independent , where collective pitch is used to keep the power at a desired level by adjusting pitch based on the mean wind speed and the individual pitch regulator is to minimize loads without affecting the power output . 8 cyclic and individual pitch control can reduce fatigue loads due to yaw errors , wind shear , up flow and shaft tilt . not only do the blades benefit from this control strategy , but reductions in loads on the drive train , nacelle structure , and tower are also seen . however

20

these control techniques are less capable of reducing the loads due to wind gusts and turbulence . 9

1.4.1.2 background
research by larsen , madsen , and thomsen8 and by bossanyi9 has shown that load reductions are possible using advanced pitch control . they conducted aeroelastic

numerical simulations to analyze both cyclic and individual pitch control and compared it to collective pitch methods . the turbine used in the simulations had a nominal rated power of 2 mw and a rotor diameter of 76 m. the results indicated that advanced pitch control could lead to a reduction of up to 30 % in both 20 year fatigue loads and extreme loads on many major turbine components . a separate simulation by bossanyi9 showed that individual pitch control could reduce the fatigue loads at the hub by 30-40 % and at the blade roots by 20-30 % . a more recent control approach suggested using feed forward control based on the incoming wind field instead of or in addition to using local flow measurements at the blade . van der hooft and van engelen 10 suggested the estimation of incoming wind speed based on energy balance and hand , wright , fingersh , and harris 11 proposed the use of a lidar system to directly measure the upwind incoming flow field . these methods may further improve the performance of individual pitch control .

1.4.1.3 wind turbine control
there are three major concerns when considering individual pitch control.6 first , the entire blade still must be pitched . the flow conditions along a long blade are not uniform and therefore pitching the entire blade may not be ideal . second , the pitching mechanism may be unable to act fast enough to relieve the oscillating loads due to wind gusts . these

gusts have rise times on the order of a couple of seconds and last for 5 to 10 seconds ; the international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) wind turbine design standard calls for consideration of an extreme gust that lasts for 10 seconds where the wind speed increases by 35 % from the mean wind in a period of just over two seconds . 12 third , there is a concern that individual blade pitch will result in over-use of the pitching mechanism . it is important to design turbines to use individual pitch from the start ; retrofitting current turbines with individual pitch control will lead to premature failure of the pitch mechanism due to the resulting high duty cycle . challenges with implementation include response time requirements to counter load perturbations , the need larger pitch motors , and the power required to operate the system under a new control strategy.6 1.4.2 blade twist control

1.4.2.1 description 13,14,15,16,17,18
one concept for controlling fatigue loads on a wind turbine blade is to use passive blade bend-twist coupling13-18 . the aeroelastic tailored blade is designed so that the twist distribution changes as the blade bends due to aerodynamic loads . this is now possible through the advent of composite materials , which can be implemented in a deliberate fashion to control flap-twist coupling . for example , an off-axis ( e.g . 20° ) orientation of reinforcement fibers ( e.g . glass , carbon , kevlar , etc . ) along a supporting spar will cause the spar to twist under sufficient bending strain.18 the transient loads due to wind gusts theoretically could be reduced because the blade would twist towards lower angles of attack , thereby mitigating the loads and potentially reducing pitch activity as well .

22

1.4.2.2 background
according to lobitz and veers14 , bend-twist coupling can lead to a 20 - 70 % decrease in fatigue damage to the turbine , corresponding to a 20 - 30 % decrease in fatigue loads . an economic analysis by general electric showed that reductions in coe of around 6 % could be expected from a moderately aeroelastic tailored blade.18

1.4.2.3 wind turbine control
some of the challenges with this concept include reduced energy capture , higher costs , and blade integrity issues.18 first , reduced energy capture may occur due to altering a blade that is designed for optimum energy capture at rated speed by causing it to twist . basically , energy as well as loads will be shed . second , higher costs associated with materials and manufacturing techniques may make the concept uneconomical . third , the fabrication technique may lead to decreased stiffness and additional material may be required to counteract additional blade deflection . active blade twist control can be conceptually achieved by embedding active laminates such as piezoelectric material in the spar caps of the blade . there are several challenges that face this concept , including blade structural integrity , cost of active materials , and actuation power requirements.6 1.4.3 variable diameter rotor

1.4.3.1 description
this concept 18,19 is capable of improving energy capture in low wind speeds and reducing loads on the rotor in high wind conditions . variable diameter rotors operate by extending/retracting a tip blade out of a root blade ( fig . 1-3 ) to increase/decrease the diameter ( fig . 1-4 ) . during low-wind speed , a large rotor diameter provides more

23

capture area , which results in larger aerodynamic loads and an increase in energy capture . however , this operation generates larger blade root and tower base bending loads . in higher wind speeds , the rotor diameter can be decreased to avoid excessive loads . the tip blade would extend and retract independently of the pitching mechanism and it would respond to gross changes in the wind speed ; the pitch control would still be used to regulate power .

fig . 1-3 illustration of extendable blade .

1.4.3.2 background
a collaboration of doe , energy unlimited , and knight and carver19 manufactured and tested turbine blades with this design on a 120 kw turbine . the prototype blade ( fig . 1-4b ) was created using kenetech 56-100 tips mounted within aerostar 9-meter blades . the blades were capable of adjusting length from 8 m to 12 m. additional changes were

24

made to the turbine and more sophisticated controls were developed for proper control of blade length . results from this prototype showed that a potential increase in power production in low winds is possible , about 20-50 % above that of a standard blade in wind speeds from 7-9 m/s . a decrease in performance was found to occur at rated speed ; this was most likely due to the poor aerodynamics of the prototype . the measured power curves for different blade lengths are shown in fig . 1-5. computational experiments showed improved aerodynamic performance at all wind speeds , accompanied by an increase in peak and fatigue loads during low wind speeds .

fig . 1-5 measured power curves of the prototype blades . ( source : doe19 )

this design is now being developed by frontier wind ( formerly energy unlimited ) , who is continuing to test the prototype turbine , making advances in blade design and developing more sophisticated control algorithms . ge wind18 also has researched this concept and has reported that a reduction in coe of approximately 18 % could occur with a properly designed and operating full-size turbine equipped with a variable blade system.18

25

1.4.3.3 wind turbine control
the variable diameter rotor has potential for increasing energy production for a given load spectrum . the initial results from the small prototype turbine show that the concept works ; the next step is to develop a full-scale prototype turbine . there are several engineering challenges that must be resolved in order to make a successful and marketable turbine . the challenges include complex control strategies , the need to

maintain a high aerodynamic efficiency , increased blade weight , and general issues with durability and reliability of the system as a whole . 1.4.4 active flow control active flow control ( afc ) is the control of the local airflow surrounding the blade . the purpose of flow control is often to improve the aerodynamic performance of an airfoil or lifting surface . however , for utility-scale wind turbines the main focus is to reduce extreme loads , which occur during high wind activity , and to mitigate fatigue loads , which vary along a blade and can occur randomly . to do this , active load control devices or “ smart ” devices must include actuators and sensors located along the span of the blade . the system must be able to sense changes in the local flow conditions and respond quickly to counter any negative impact on blade loading . this arrangement provides active “ smart ” control over the rotor . by definition , a smart structure involves distributed actuators and sensors and one or more microprocessors that analyze the responses from the sensors and use integrated control theory to command the actuators to apply localized strains/displacements to alter system response . 20 numerous investigations on the use of afc devices show that significant load reduction is possible .

active flow control
flow control is being researched for a number of fields other than wind energy .

researchers in fields such as manned and unmanned airplanes , rotorcraft , and gas turbines are all interested in and investigating the potential benefits of active load and flow control . in general , the intent of flow control devices is to delay/advance transition , to suppress/enhance turbulence , or to prevent/promote separation . the ensuing effects include drag reduction , lift enhancement , mixing augmentation , heat transfer enhancement , and flow-induced noise reduction . 21 however , these effects are not

necessarily mutually exclusive . improving one objective may have adverse effects on other areas . the goal is to choose a flow control scheme that achieves an overall beneficial goal with minimal tradeoffs .

2.1 flow control methodology
flow control methods are categorized similarly to the load control techniques explained earlier ; either passive or active . some passive techniques include geometric shaping to manipulate the pressure gradient , the use of fixed mechanical vortex generators for separation control , the addition of a gurney flap at the trailing edge , and the placement of longitudinal grooves or riblets on a surface to reduce drag . 22 active control methods can be broken into two categories : predetermined and interactive ( open- or closed-loop ) . a flow chart displaying flow control methodologies is shown in fig . 2-1. to demonstrate the difference between the methods , the case of constant blowing to enhance post-stall lift will be used .

27

fig . 2-1 flow control methodologies diagram . ( source : kral22 )

predetermined control introduces steady or unsteady energy inputs without concern for the state of flow . therefore , there are no sensors required for this method and the control loop is open . in this situation , the constant blowing device would operate

continuously with no regard for the wind speed or pitch angle . in contrast , an interactive control system contains an actuator , a controller , and a sensor . the system can either operate in open- or closed-loop form . open-loop control does not observe the output process that it is controlling ; therefore , it can not determine if its input has achieved the desired goal . in the example , the constant blowing device would be programmed to turn on once a set angle of attack is exceeded . closed-loop control utilizes feedback to compare the actual output with the desired output . a feedback control law is used to drive the actuator or device in order to

28

minimize the error between the reference value and the feedback signal . in the example , the blowing device would have an additional sensor to detect the onset of flow separation . it would be programmed to turn on once flow separation is detected . closed-loop systems would be the most beneficial for wind turbine control . the main advantages are energy consumption and safety . predetermined systems operate continuously even when the device is not needed , thereby using excess energy . openloop systems would be more efficient , but at times would still operate unnecessarily . in addition with using excess energy , both of these systems could also be detrimental to the system since they do not observe the output . improper control of active devices has been shown to have serious negative impacts on turbine operation and overall safety . by using feedback , the control system can be configured to turn on and shut down the afc system as needed .

2.2 flow control categories
flow control can be broken down into the three separate categories : control/sensors , actuators/devices , and flow phenomena . the communication starts with the controls and sensors , which continuously update the system controller on the flow properties and the overall operation . when adjustments are required , the controller commands the actuators to activate the flow control devices . the devices then change their method of operation , altering the local flow phenomena . the sensors track this change and the cycle repeats . fig . 2-2 displays the flow control categories and lists some examples related to wind turbine control . the figure shows that tackling a flow control problem requires a multidisciplinary approach and research in many areas .

2.3 flow control on wind turbines
this report focuses on different afc devices and actuators , including their associated flow phenomena . it does not go into detail about the necessary sensors and controls , which are critical components of a complete system . although research is being conducted in these areas , it is beyond the scope of this report . however , as one

investigates possible devices it is important to keep the complete system in mind . fig . 2-3 presents one possible layout of a control strategy for a complete system . this layout includes two types of controllers , a master controller and individual blade controllers . the master controller would have similar duties to those found in traditional wind turbine controls ( manage pitch angle , tip-speed ratio , etc ) , but would also communicate with the blade controllers . the blade controller would receive input from the sensors ( local flow conditions and/or strain in the blades ) , communicate with the 30

master controller , and then output commands to the afc devices located on the blade . fig . 2-3 illustrates trailing-edge devices coupled with leading-edge sensors . however , as detailed later in chapter 3 , there are several different types and locations of afc devices .

fig . 2-3 control strategy diagram of a complete system .

it is important to remember that the primary purpose of active flow control ( afc ) systems on wind turbines is the following : •

to mitigate excessive loads ( extreme , fatigue , cyclic , etc . ) caused by variations in the wind .

one foreseeable way to counter excessive loads is to supplement current full-span pitch control with afc devices . pitching would still be used to optimize energy yield and control aerodynamic torque , while afc devices would be able to react quickly to reduce

31

the oscillatory , high-frequency loads caused by turbulent winds . the operation of afc devices also has some potential secondary benefits : 1 ) devices may be deployed to increase lift of the blade at low wind speeds , allowing the turbine to cut-in earlier and capture additional energy . 2 ) on downwind machines , these devices could deploy every revolution to counteract the tower wake effect . 3 ) active devices could aid in energy capture and load mitigation on turbines that experience high array effects . 4 ) devices could be used to prevent tower strikes , allowing for larger diameter rotors to be used and thereby increasing energy capture.6 5 ) aerodynamic performance enhancement and noise reduction could be realized by maintaining laminar flow over the blade . 6 ) the blade could operate higher on the lift curve with the devices protecting the blade from getting into stall .

flow control devices
overall , there are fifteen ( 15 ) devices that will be discussed in this report . while these

devices have shown potential for wind turbine control and merit future research , none of them have matured to a point of being tested on full-scale turbines . also , several of the techniques have not yet been investigated for wind turbine control . instead , many of the techniques have focused on other fields such as rotorcraft or unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) . since all of the devices function differently , both mechanically and aerodynamically , and are at varying stages of maturity , it is difficult to make direct comparisons . the first step in discussing the numerous afc devices is to define a labeling scheme that can be used to classify each concept . a proposed four ( 4 ) layer scheme utilized in the present report is presented in table 1. the labeling scheme was derived from a paper on afc for uavs by wood 23 .

1st layer
the first layer identifies the technique as a geometric device ( g ) or a fluidic device ( f ) . geometric devices ( g ) move a portion of the external surface , thereby changing the section shape and attaching the airflow about the airfoil . fluidic devices ( f ) actively change the flow about the blade section by either adding air into or subtracting air from the external flow . there are two devices that do not fall into one of these two categories . one device , synthetic jets , is classified as a combination of geometric and fluidic ( g / f ) devices as it uses mechanical motion , which is not in contact with the external airflow , to oscillate a membrane in a cavity inside the airfoil and this , in turn , generates air motion in the external flow . the other device , plasma actuators ( p ) , uses an electric field to generate a body force on the surrounding fluid , thus modifying its behavior .

33

2nd layer
the second layer describes the location of the device , such as near the leading edge ( le ) , near the trailing edge ( te ) , or mid-chord ( mc ) .

3rd layer
the third layer describes how the device adjusts the lift curve . investigations of the afc devices show that the lift curve of an airfoil is affected in one of two ways . first , the device shifts the entire lift curve up or down , which is done by effectively changing the camber of the airfoil . this is labeled as increasing lift ( i ) or decreasing lift ( d ) . many devices are capable of shifting the lift curve both up and down ; those are labeled ( i/d ) . second , the device extends the lift curve of the airfoil to stall at a higher angle of attack , this is labeled delay stall ( ds ) . fig . 3-1 displays the two different ways that the lift curve can be adjusted .

fig . 3-1 adjustments in lift curve due to flow control techniques , a ) ds devices , b ) i / d devices ( source : berg et al.6 )

34

description of modified blades with ds devices
to successfully mitigate loads , the device must be able to decrease the generated lift . at first observation , delaying stall ( ds ) only increases lift at high angles of attack as shown in fig . 3-1a . this does not decrease lift ; therefore , ds devices would not be considered as an option for load alleviation . although they could contribute to some of the secondary benefits listed in section 2.3. however , an idea presented by corten 24 provides an alternative method of using ds devices to reduce turbine loads . the common application of ds devices ( in this example , passive vortex generators ) is to add them onto an existing design to increase clmax and delay stall . corten ’ s idea is to redesign blade so that the maximum fig . sectional lift of a blade with
3-2 airfoils with comparable lift generation . 24 a ds device equals that of ( source : corten )

the original blade without a ds device . fig . 3-2 demonstrates the difference in chord length between the redesigned , or modified , blade and the original blade . the idea can be more easily explained by analyzing the lift equation :

1 lmax = c l max ⋅ ⋅ ρ ⋅ v 2 ⋅ c 2

( eqn . 3 )

where ρ is the air density , v is the air velocity over the blade , c is the chord length , and clmax is the maximum lift coefficient . if clmax is increased by a ds device , then the chord , c , could be reduced a comparable amount so that the generated lift still equals that of the original blade . the outcome of this redesign is illustrated in fig . 3-3. the maximum sectional lift , lmax , of the original blade and the modified blade are equal ;

35

however , the slope ( δl/δα ) has been decreased . the benefits of reducing the slope are explained below and illustrated in fig . 3-4 .

fig . 3-3 comparison of modified blades with the same chord and same lift . ( source : corten24 )

fig . 3-4 diagram of benefits using modified blades with ds devices . ( source : corten24 )

36

the oscillating loads on a turbine are caused by sudden changes in lift seen by the blade . these changes in lift can be caused by a number of events , one of them being turbulence . turbulence can increase/decrease the wind velocity , v , increase/decrease the angle of attack , α , seen by a rotating turbine blade , or it can do both . therefore , to reduce these oscillating loads , the sudden changes in lift have to be mitigated . this can be accomplished by reducing the lift curve slope ( δl/δα ) . the reduced slope does three things that help to reduce the loads . one , the lift variation ( δl ) for a given δα is reduced . two , the maximum lift for a given δα is lowered . three , the magnitude of the maximum negative lift is reduced . this reduction is important during emergency shutdown for pitch-to-feather machines . as the blades pitch rapidly , they pass into negative angles of attack during which the rotor can experience high loads . corten ’ s

research indicated a potential reduction of 20-40 % for lift variation , a potential reduction of 6-12 % for extreme lift , and a potential reduction of 20-40 % for maximum negative lift . the primary benefit of modifying blades with ds devices is to decrease oscillating loads . secondary benefits are associated with the reduced chord , allowing for smaller blades and , thus requiring less material . 4th layer the fourth and final layer differentiates between a steady ( s ) and unsteady ( u ) device ( i.e . a device whose position varies with time about a nominal setting ) . for example , a trailing-edge flap system , although it could be in continual motion , is simply changing position to create a series of steady state conditions and is therefore considered to be a steady device . the motion itself is not used to create an aerodynamic control force , as is the case of , i.e . , pulsed vortex generating jets . most of the devices that operate unsteadily 37

are also capable of steady operation ; therefore , these devices are labeled ( s/u ) . however , research into these devices has shown that unsteady , or pulsed , operation is usually more effective .

table 1 classification chart used to label each afc device .

table 1 shows all fifteen devices that will be discussed . to more easily present the various afc devices , the discussions on each device are broken into four sections . the sections are as follows : 1 ) description - introduces the device and describes how it works , both mechanically and aerodynamically . 2 ) classification – explains the classification for the device . 3 ) background – presents a history of the research , including some results and the present state of the device . 4 ) wind turbine control –discusses the potential each device has for the wind energy industry , including its advantages and disadvantages and the hurdles that the technology faces .

38

commonalities of afc devices the purpose and potential benefits of afc devices have been explained , but how they operate has not . although each device operates differently , there are certain

characteristics that are required for a device to be successful . • it must be small in size so that a number of devices can be distributed along a portion of the span to provide sectional flow control at different locations of the turbine blade . this also means the device should be scalable , meaning it can be effective across a range of chord lengths . • the device must have a fast activation speed . this is necessary to counter the high frequency oscillatory loads and to provide proper aeroelastic control . • the activation forces and power requirements must be low so that the energy to operate the afc system is lower than or equal to the additional energy gain from the turbine . this allows for the secondary benefit of improved energy capture . • the afc system needs to be reliable and dependable . the turbine should be able to maintain operation if one or more afc devices fail . • it is necessary for the device to be durable and robust in order to withstand the harsh environments seen by turbines . basically , the addition of a flow control system should not drastically increase maintenance costs . the lifetime of the system also should be similar to the lifetime of the turbine and its components . • the integration of the afc system into a turbine blade needs to be taken into consideration from both a manufacturing and maintenance point of view . current blade manufacturing techniques should still be used ; if a device fails , it should be easily replaceable in an inexpensive and straightforward manner .

39

•

in the end , the driving factor for the success or failure of an afc system is economics . a successful system must be able to reduce the cost of energy for wind turbines .

all of the afc devices will face certain challenges that will have to be overcome before any degree of implementation can be reached on commercial wind turbines . since the vast majority of actuators and sensors will have to be placed on or within the turbine blade , substantial modifications to the blades will be required . this will add complexity to the entire system and require a more sophisticated control system that would be capable of properly operating the afc devices . research on several devices has indicated that improper control of afc devices could have a detrimental effect on the performance and safety of a wind turbine .

3.1 traditional trailing-edge flaps
3.1.1 description

traditional trailing-edge flaps , or ailerons , have been utilized in the past on wind turbine blades for aerodynamic braking and load control . fig . 3-5 shows a wind turbine blade modified with a large trailing-edge flap being tested at the national wind technology center in boulder , colorado . there are two different configurations ( depending on torsional stiffness of the blade ) in which ailerons can be used for load control.6 on a torsionally stiff blade , deflection of the flap to the pressure surface generates an increase in aerodynamic load and a deflection to the suction side decreases the aerodynamic load . on a torsionally soft blade , a deflection of the flap towards the pressure surface will create a pitching moment that twists the nose of the blade towards the pressure surface , thereby decreasing the angle of attack and , hence , the load .

40

likewise , a flap deflection in the opposing direction twists the blade toward the suction surface , thereby increasing the angle of attack and , hence , the load on the blade .

geometric device located at the trailing edge of the blade capable of deploying in both directions and therefore can adjust the lift curve up and down operates by changing the deflection angle in a steady-state manner

3.1.3 background

initial investigations of active flow control devices were performed by the national renewable energy laboratory ( nrel ) in the 1990 ’ s . the devices , often called ailerons , were analyzed for power regulation and aerodynamic braking . wind-tunnel experiments examined the performance of ailerons at different configurations . 25,26 field tests also were performed using the aileron device at fixed positions ( no active control ) , during which 3-d effects associated with variable span-wise deployment of the control devices were identified during turbine operation . 27 stuart , wright , and butterfield 28,29 discuss the possible advantages of active devices for turbine control to mitigate the effects of damaging loads . a simple numerical control case study using ailerons is presented along with simulations investigating the use of actively controlled devices for load reduction.28 in this study , the intention was not to design an optimal controller , but rather to successfully implement a simple pi control

scheme using the aeroelastic analysis code fast 30 .

the controlling ailerons were

located on the outer 30 % blade span . the controlled aileron case showed a reduced response time for a step-gust wind input , with reduced root flap bending moments and improved power regulation during a simulated turbulent wind input . additional simulations29 were also conducted using a more advanced design approach for the controller . the fast code , along with system identification tools , was used to generate a wind turbine dynamic model for use with the active aileron . simulation results

indicated that aileron load control could assist in power regulation and reduce root flap bending moments during a step-gust and turbulent wind situation .
3.1.4 wind turbine control

the trailing-edge flap design instantly comes to mind as a potential for wind turbine control because of its success in aircraft control . however , there are several concerns with the nrel flap design including its large size , additional weight , complex linkage systems and slow response . additional power requirements to actuate the large flap and aeroacoustic noise generated by gaps are also a concern .

3.2 nontraditional trailing-edge flaps
3.2.1 description

nontraditional trailing-edge flaps use newer technology , such as piezoelectrics and “ smart ” materials , to improve upon traditional trailing-edge flaps . whereas traditional flaps tend to be heavy , slow , and take up a large portion of the chord , nontraditional flaps have a quick activation , are lightweight , and occupy less chord . these improvements allow nontraditional flaps to counter the extreme and fatigue loads . there are three

42

devices discussed in this section ; the compact trailing-edge flap , the adaptive trailing edge geometry ( ateg ) , and the adaptive compliant wing . compact trailing-edge flaps a compact trailing-edge flap is being researched for rotorcraft control . the compact design , seen in fig . 3-6 , is comparable to a scaled-down nrel aileron ; however it uses small piezoelectric actuators located inside the blade to quickly move a tension rod that deflects the flap . the compact design allows for the quick deployment required to reduce rotor vibrations .

fig . 3-6 left : cad model showing the layout of the piezoelectric actuated flaps . ( source : enenkl et al.33 ) , right : photo of actively controlled piezoelectric flaps on the bk117 blade . ( source : roth et al.34 )

adaptive trailing edge geometry ( ateg ) the adaptive trailing edge geometry ( ateg ) 35-39 is a trailing-edge flap that has no seems or hinges . the deformable flap is made of piezoelectric actuators that are attached to the main airfoil . it has the ability to deflect quickly and independently along the span of the blade . the ateg is capable of rotating through a flap angle range , ßflap , of −3.0

to +1.8 degrees . fig . 3-7 illustrates the approximate size ( relative to the airfoil chord ) and deflection angles of the ateg . deflecting the ateg towards the suction side ( negative ßflap ) shows a downward translation in the lift curve , whereas a deflection to the pressure side ( positive ßflap ) moves the lift curve upward , increasing aerodynamic load . 43

fig . 3-7 illustration of main airfoil and the ateg trailing-edge flap . three different positions of the ateg are shown . ( source : bak et al.39 )

adaptive compliant wing the third device considered to be a nontraditional flap is the adaptive compliant wing developed by flexsys , inc. 31 and the u.s. air force research laboratories . a compliant mechanism is defined as a mechanism that relies on elastic deformation of its constituent elements to transmit motion and/or force . 32 the concept and the aerodynamics are similar to those of the ateg ; however , the internal actuation mechanism is different . this design ( fig . 3-8 ) uses conventional electromechanical actuators to deform a compliant structure that takes the shape of the trailing edge . the flap can deflect over a range of +10 to -10 degrees at speeds up to 20 deg/sec and it can also twist differentially up to one degree per foot over the span of the model.32

3.2.2 classification

g te i/d s/u

geometric device located at the trailing edge of the blade capable of deploying both directions and therefore can adjust the lift curve up and down both steady and unsteady ( oscillating ) operation are being researched

3.2.3 background

compact trailing-edge flaps the most recent compact trailing-edge flap was developed under the adasys project ( a collaboration of eurocopter , eads crc , daimler chrysler research labs and dlr ) . 33,34 a functional full-scale rotor was built and tests of the system demonstrated large reductions ( 50-90 % ) in vibratory loads . adaptive trailing edge geometry ( ateg ) several computational experiments have been conducted for development of the ateg to be used for wind turbine control . analytical studies conducted at risoe national laboratory-dtu showed that significant reductions in the rms of the unsteady load level ( simulating fatigue loading ) are possible with an actively controlled trailingedge flap . using a 2-d potential-flow solver , basualdo 35 investigated the movement of an airfoil in a turbulent flow field and found that the standard deviation of the airfoil position normal to the chord could be reduced using an afc device.35 troldborg 36 studied the static and dynamic aerodynamic performance of a 2-d airfoil equipped with different shaped ategs . three different shapes were analyzed : rigid , soft curved , and strongly curved . the static simulations showed that the soft curved flaps performed better . these studies showed that an oscillating airfoil superimposed with an oscillating

45

ateg could significantly reduce the amplitude of the lift generated over a wide range of reduced airfoil frequencies , k , of 0.09 – 0.36 , where k is defined as ;
k=

ω c
2 u∞

( eqn . 4 )

where , ω is the frequency of pitch oscillation , c is the chord length , and u∞ is the freestream velocity . the reduced airfoil frequency is used to quantify the speed of an airfoil ’ s oscillations . physically , it represents the portion of the oscillation cycle , in radians , that elapses during the time it takes the local flow to travel half a chord length . this parameter is important when analyzing performance during dynamic stall ( the process of boundary-layer separation from an airfoil experiencing a dynamic increase in angle of attack ) . two-dimensional aeroelastic studies conducted by buhl , guanna , and bak 37 showed that the ateg could reduce the standard deviation of the normal force on an airfoil caused by changing wind speeds ; up to 95 % for a sudden step in wind speed and up to 81 % for a turbulent flow ( 10 % intensity ) . a similar test was conducted using a simplified aeroelastic model of a vestas v66 wind turbine to look at the equivalent flapwise blade root moment . anderson , gaunaa , bak and buhl 38 found that the flapwise moment was reduced 60 % for inflow with a turbulent field of 10 % intensity using a 7 m ateg on a 33 m blade .

46

this preliminary research led to the construction of a physical model equipped with the ateg system ( fig . 3-9 ) . in 2006 bak , gaunaa , anderson , buhl , hansen , clemmensen and moeller 39 performed wind tunnel tests on a risoe-b1-18 40,41 ateg . ( photo by risoe dtu national
laboratory for sustainable energy39 ) fig . 3-9 wind-tunnel model with trailing edge

airfoil with a 16.4 % maximum thicknessto-chord ratio and a chord of 0.66 m ( 26.0 in . ) equipped with 9 % c piezoelectric actuated flaps . a total of 36 thunder© th-6r piezoelectric bender actuators were used to form a flap along the entire span ( 1.9 m ) . the results from the wind tunnel experiments39 included steady and dynamic tests at 40 m/s , corresponding to a re = 1.66 × 106. the steady state tests showed that deflecting the ateg towards the pressure side ( positive ßflap ) at an angle of ßflap = 1.5° resulted in a δcl = +0.036 and deflecting it towards the suction side ( negative ßflap ) at an angle of ßflap = -2.5° resulted in a δcl = -0.066. the drag was almost unaffected by the actuation . a step change of the ateg from ßflap = -3.0° to +1.8° showed that , within the linear lift region of the airfoil , a δcl = 0.10 - 0.13 could be obtained . steady lift results are shown in fig . 3-10 .

the tests also showed the ateg ’ s ability to cancel out the load variations of the airfoil in a sinusoidal pitch motion and that it was possible to reduce fluctuations ( measured in δcl ) by 80 % . the phase shift between the ateg motion and pitch motion proved to be a significant variable ; large reductions were accomplished with a phase shift of 30° . experiments simulating improper control ( a 180° phase shift from the optimal shift ) increased the δcl by 70 % . additional experiments 42 testing the capabilities of the ateg concept were carried out by duwind ( delft university wind energy research institute ) . the goal of these tests was to show that vibrations in a dynamically scaled blade due to randomly varying aerodynamic loads could be significantly reduced using trailing edge devices . a reduced scale wind turbine blade ( span = 90 cm , chord = 12 cm ) embedded with four thunder© th-6r piezoelectric bender actuators 43 was tested in a wind tunnel ( fig . 3-11 ) . the actuators formed two different flaps of 50 % c and were covered with soft foam and a latex skin . the blade was constant thickness with no twist along the span . the model was

48

3.2.4 wind turbine control

nontraditional flaps operate on the same principle as traditional flaps , to change the sectional camber by deflecting the trailing-edge portion of the airfoil . however , the use “ smart ” materials ( in these concepts : linear and bending piezoelectric actuators , and compliant structures ) make these devices aerodynamically superior to the traditional flap . this is due to minimal drag production over a wide lift range . traditional flaps tend to produce flow separation and increase drag during deployment . promising results have been shown in numerical studies , wind-tunnel experiments , and also in mechanical design . additional research to continue development of

nontraditional flaps must address many criteria including the required aerodynamic shapes , the required stiffness and dynamic response , and the weight and power required to actuate the control surface.32 although these “ smart ” materials offer many advantages , they often come with their own set of problems . inherent drawbacks of these concepts include scalability to large models and the durability and reliability of the deployment devices ( both piezoelectric and compliant structures ) . long-term use is a concern because creep or degradation of these materials can occur , which would drastically limit their performance . a highvoltage electric power supply would be required to activate the piezoelectric material based actuators .

3.3 microtabs
3.3.1 description

active translational microtabs have been proposed as a viable and effective device for active load control applications . the concept involves small tabs located near the trailing edge of an airfoil , similar to gurney flaps . 45 the tabs are deployed approximately

perpendicular to the airfoil surface to a height on the order of the boundary layer thickness ( 1-2 % chord ) . this slight movement affects the aerodynamics of the airfoil by shifting the point of flow separation ( kutta condition ) , in turn , altering the trailing-edge flow conditions and effectively changing the camber . this phenomenon is illustrated in fig . 3-12 using instantaneous streamlines from computational simulations . lift enhancement is achieved by deploying the tab on the pressure ( lower ) surface and lift mitigation is achieved by deploying the tab on the suction ( upper ) surface .

3.3.3 background 46,47,48

the initial development of the microtab concept was conducted by researchers at uc davis in the late 1990s.46-48 both computational and experimental studies on lower surface microtabs on the gu25-5 ( 11 ) 8 airfoil 49 were performed in 2-d and 3-d operation . the effects of tab height , tab location and tab spacing were all investigated for 3-d applications . the results indicated that a tab of 1 % c in height , located at x/c = 95 % on the lower surface provided the best compromise for lift , drag , and volume constraints.46 for both numerical and experimental tests , a 30-50 % increase in cl was seen in the linear lift region with 1 % c tabs.46 standish and van dam 50 and van dam , standish , and baker 51 conducted more comprehensive 2-d computational experiments further examining tab height and location on both upper and lower surface on the s809 and the gu25-5 ( 11 ) 8 airfoil . pressure surface tabs demonstrated an increase in lift over all angles of attack , whereas suction surface tabs only decrease lift at angles of attack throughout the linear region . the suction surface tabs lose effectiveness at the higher angles of attack because the flow separates forward of the tab location . the optimal location for the lower surface tab in terms of lift and drag was again found to be around 95 % c with a height on the order of the boundary layer thickness , or ~1 % c . the computational studies were validated in the

52

wind tunnel on the s809 airfoil . the results 52 are shown in fig . 3-13 and agree very well , especially in the linear region .

fig . 3-13 comparison between experimental and computational results for lower surface tabs on the baseline s809 airfoil with a re=1×106 . ( source : baker et al.52 )

although earlier reports on 3-d investigations indicated that solid tabs generate the best lift enhancement , gaps may be necessary for actuation purposes and for some pitching moment and drag reduction benefits . 53,54 mayda , van dam , and yen-nakafuji 55 performed more detailed computational investigations on the 3-d effects of microtabs by modeling finite width tabs on a semi-infinite wing . studies showed that tab effectiveness reduced as the gap size was increased . the amount of gap can be identified with a solidity ratio , sr , defined as ; sr = span covered by tabs total span of model
( eqn . 5 )

computational results indicated that a solidity ratio of 85 % or higher should be maintained for proper effectiveness . a solidity ratio lower than 75 % allows the flow to reattach at the trailing edge , thereby drastically reducing the tab ’ s performance .

53

in order to fully understand the behavior of these devices , chow and van dam 56,57 conducted computational studies analyzing the unsteady behavior and potential nonlinearites during the deployment of a pressure surface microtab integrated into a s809 airfoil . for analysis purposes , a non-dimensional deployment time , tdeployment , was used to study the tab ’ s motion . tdeployment = u ∞ ⋅ t deployment c
( eqn . 6 )

where u∞ is the free-stream velocity ( m/s ) , tdeployment is the actual deployment time ( s ) , and c is the chord length ( m ) . the transient flow behavior for tdeployment = 1 can be seen in fig . 3-14 and fig . 3-15. as the tab deploys , a low-pressure region and a counterclockwise vortex form just aft of the tab . up until a non-dimensional deployment time of t = 0.8 ( fig . 3-14/15f ) , the emergent tab-generated vortex acts like a separation bubble . as the bubble extends past the trailing edge , an interesting phenomenon occurs ; the suction surface flow at the trailing edge is entrained back into the pressure surface vortex . fig . 3-14/15g shows the suction surface flow being drawn around the trailing edge and back towards the tab . the flow continues traveling on the pressure surface , driven by the vortex , and up the aft part of the tab until it reconnects with the pressure surface flow from upstream of the tab . a new stagnation point is formed at the tip of the tab , where the two flows leave the airfoil/tab surface ( fig . 3-14/15h ) . the shift of the separation point from the trailing edge to the end of the tab changes the kutta condition of the airfoil . in this situation , the effective camber is increased and cl is increased . the results from the computational studies on the dynamic behavior of tabs show that only small transient effects are seen during deployment ; therefore , these devices can be designed and operated as simple “ on54

off ” devices . this allows for the use of more simple control strategies and actuation mechanisms . the latest wind-tunnel experiments investigating the microtab concept were conducted on a blade tip model . 58 the half-scale model ( model span of 24.7 in . ) was representative of the outboard 10 % of the ers-100 horizontal-axis turbine blade . this experiment was the first test of the microtab ’ s performance in a fully three-dimensional flowfield . tab heights of 1 % and 1.5 % chord were investigated under free and fixed transition at reynolds numbers of 350,000 and 460,000. the tests used static , singlepiece ( non-segmented ) tabs running the span of the model located at 95 % c on the pressure surface and at 90 % c on the suction surface . the microtabs showed similar effectiveness as seen in the two-dimensional tests.58 nearly constant lift increases of 9 % and 22 % were achieved with lower ( pressure ) surface 1 % c and 1.5 % c tabs , respectively . lift reductions in the linear lift regime of 20 % and 30 % were seen for upper ( suction ) surface 1 % c and 1.5 % c tabs , respectively . these results confirm that tabs are effective in fully three-dimensional flowfields , a crucial step towards potential full-scale applications .

further research has been conducted on the effectiveness of tabs using aeroelastic simulation in conjunction with a simple control program . for this analysis ,

fast/aerodyn software30,59 was used along with matlab ’ s simulink 60 . the nreldeveloped simulink/fast interface was modified to simulate independent control of several radial sections of microtabs on each blade and also to allow for inputs that model the time dependence of the section lift and drag changes as the microtabs are deployed and retracted . the nrel controls advanced research turbine ( cart ) , a 600 kw twobladed upwind turbine , was modeled to demonstrate the impact of microtabs on blade loading . since earlier simulations showed that the control effectiveness of the microtabs is optimized if they are located on the outer 25 % of the blade span , 61 the model was equipped with a microtab system in this configuration on the suction surface of the blade . a simple control-system simulation was designed to deploy the section of microtabs on one blade every time it passed in front of the tower . the loads on only that one blade were attenuated . as the blade passed the tower , the tabs were retraced and the load attenuation diminished . this simulation was meant to provide only a graphic demonstration of the impact of microtabs ; this is not a situation that would actually be implemented for actual turbine operation . the results for a 15 m/s steady wind ( no turbulence- or gust-induced loading ) and an 18.2 m/s turbulent wind are shown in fig . 3-16 and fig . 3-17 , respectively . in both cases , a positive tip displacement indicates movement toward the tower ; a smaller displacement means more tower clearance . the microtab-equipped blade passed upwind of the tower at an azimuth angle of 180° . under both situations , the deployment of the tabs reduced the blade tip displacement , thus increasing the tower clearance of the tip by about 0.25 m. analysis of the loads revealed

57

that the blade root fatigue damage was increased as a result of tab deployment . deployment of the microtab system at other times was also simulated and showed an increase in loads and deflections . improper control is a concern for all afc devices .

3.3.4 wind turbine control

the microtab system consists of small devices that are capable of creating changes in lift comparable to the changes created by much larger flaps . appealing features include small size , fast activation , mechanical simplicity of the design , low power requirements and a short linear deployment distance . the perpendicular motion of the tab relative to the flow requires significantly smaller forces for a given change in sectional lift compared to a traditional trailing-edge flap . the major hurdle facing this concept is minimizing air leakage between the tab and the blade . substantial leakage would

generate aeroacoustic noise and negatively affect the turbine ’ s performance . the far aft location of the tabs makes it challenging to install an actuator near the tabs . for this reason , an appropriate design would include a lever arm connecting the tab to an electromechanical actuator placed near 70 % c . if a motor and lever arm configuration were to be implemented , measures to reduce possible misalignment would have to be taken .

3.4 miniature trailing-edge effectors ( mites )
3.4.1 description

miniature trailing-edge effectors ( mites ) are small translational flaps , approximately 1-5 % chord in height , located at the trailing edge . the mite concept was inspired from the gurney flap45 and is similar to the microtab in many ways . the aerodynamic force alteration is produced by a

effectively modifying the trailing-edge kutta condition . the difference between the microtabs and the mites is the location . the mites are located at the trailing edge , therefore a blunt trailing edge with a thickness at least the same as the flap height is required to provide a space for storing the flap when retracted ( fig . 3-18 ) . the flap has three possible positions ; up , down , and neutral . lift enhancement occurs when the flap is in the down position and lift mitigation is realized when the flap is in the up position .

studies have been conducted . a cad model of a wing equipped with a mite system is shown in fig . 3-19 .
fig . 3-19 concept wing with mites . ( source : bieniawski et al.65 )

one study performed by lee and kroo 63 analyzed the three dimensional aerodynamics of the mites using an incompressible navier-stokes flow solver . the study looked at the impact of flap aspect ratio , af , on the lift distribution and overall performance . the flap aspect ratio is defined as ;

60

af =

lf lg

( eqn . 7 )

where lf is the length of the flap and lg is the length of the gap between two flaps . the flap height was kept constant at 1 % c and lf was equal to lg , meaning that in all cases 50 % of the wing was covered by tabs . results indicated a linear relationship between cl and the spanwise length of the flap , lf . the knowledge of this relationship could provide designers with more freedom when selecting the spanwise flap length to fit their specific needs . another computational study by lee and kroo 64 investigated the steady and unsteady aerodynamics of mites . the focus was on the change in lift , drag , and pitching moments with fully deployed mites as compared to a clean configuration . the steady state simulations looked at different trailing edge thicknesses , flap sizes , reynolds numbers , and angles of attack . one result showed that a larger δcl occurred for larger flap heights . a flap height of 3.0 % c had a maximum δcl of approximately 0.45 for both the sharp and blunt trailing edge

configurations . some of the results are shown in fig . 3-20. several other steady state results can be found in the the were

3.4.4 wind turbine control

the mites have similar advantages to the microtabs ; they are small , require little activation force , and can respond quickly . the upside to this type of flap is that the far aft location provides more effective lift control and there is no need for slots in the blade construction , which reduces the modifications to the blade . however , the tradeoff is that a blunt trailing edge is mandatory . this will decrease performance of the turbine when the device is not active and research has shown blunt trailing edges generate noise in the tip region . 66

3.5 microflaps
3.5.1 description

microflaps are also derived from the gurney flap45 and are similar to both the microtab and mite concept . instead of a translational device like the microtab and mite , the microflap is a rotating device . it takes the position of the trailing edge and is able to rotate 90° in both directions . the optimum height is similar to that of the microtabs , which is on the order of the boundary layer thickness ( 1-2 % chord ) . a cfd model of a microflap is shown in fig . 3-22. rotating the flap up towards the suction surface reduces lift and rotating it down towards the pressure surface increases lift .

3.5.3 background

computational studies conducted by van dam , chow , zayas , and berg 67 used a modified naca 0012 airfoil with a semi-circular cove truncating the trailing edge . the flap was constructed within the cove and extended out , forming the trailing edge . the flap had a semi-circular arc leading edge with a diameter of 0.330 % c and a chord length of 1.495 % c . the goal of this computational study was to analyze the flap ’ s timedependent effect on sectional lift , drag , and pitching moment and its effectiveness in mitigating high frequency loads on a wind turbine . the flow conditions used were re = 1.0 million and m∞ = 0.25. several studies with varying non-characteristic flap deployment times ( eqn . 6 ) were carried out and the results are shown in fig . 3-23 .

64

the overall transient behavior of the microflap was found to be similar to that of the microtabs . the flaps had a slightly faster initial response time and larger lift

effectiveness due to the placement at the trailing edge . the flap placement also increased bluff-body vortex shedding .
3.5.4 wind turbine control

this concept is appealing because the trailing-edge location provides more effective lift enhancement than the microtabs and the design does not require a blunt trailing edge as does the mites . limited studies have been conducted on this concept , which makes it difficult to define all of the benefits and drawbacks . some anticipated hurdles are minimizing air leakage and designing a simple , effective actuation system that is capable of rotating the flap bi-directionally to an angle of 90° .

3.6 active stall strips
3.6.1 description

small stall strips , or spoilers , are placed parallel to and near to the leading edge ( x/c < 0.1 ) to provide control over the stalling characteristics of an airfoil.68 the strips operate by separating the flow near the leading edge . studies have been conducted for both passive and active control . passive strips were designed to be implemented on stallregulated wind turbines , but with modern variable-pitch turbines they do not provide any advantages . active strips , on the other hand , could provide some benefits for turbine control . active stall strips would be capable of deploying and retracting in response to changes in local flow conditions . instead of increasing cl with deployment , as many of the other afc devices do , active stall strips decrease cl and increase cd as a means of control . although , nearly all stall strips in use today are static except for the actively controlled stall strips on the lockheed-martin u-2 airplane .

3.6.3 background

there has not been much recent research regarding this device . a 1991 paper by lewis , potts , and arain 68 summarized experiments looking at optimal location and size of a spoiler on a nasa ls ( 1 ) -0417 mod airfoil . this airfoil was selected because of its use on the orkney 3 mw wind turbine . three spoiler heights ( 3 mm ( 0.767 % c ) , 6 mm ( 1.535 % c ) , and 9 mm ( 2.302 % c ) ) at five different chordwise locations ( one on the lower

67

surface , one on the leading edge , and three on the upper surface ) were tested at different angles of attack . the locations and heights of the tested spoilers , along with predicted streamlines , are shown in fig . 3-24 .

fig . 3-24 a ) location of leading edge spoilers showing the first 10 % of chord , b ) prediction of leading edge streamlines for varying angles of attack . ( source : lewis et al.68 )

active strips were found to be most effective at location no . 5 ( x = 2.9 % c ) . at this location , small spoiler heights ( h < 0.77 % c ) provided drag control without inducing major stall and associated buffeting . the height of the strip could be adjusted depending on what type of control was needed . for stable ( unstalled ) control , the stall strip could be deployed only a short distance to provide adequate control . results showed that a height of 0.77 % c could decrease cl/cd decreased from 70 to 18. in this configuration , the strip acted as a turbulence promoter , inhibiting boundary layer separation . greater

deployment distances ( 0.77 % c < h < 1.53 % c ) provided control by inducing upper surface stall and was found to be more suitable for braking . at these heights , the strip acts as a flow separation trip resulting in a cl/cd reduction from 18 to 3.4. the differences in the

lift curves for spoilers located at position no . 2 and position no . 5 on fig . 3-24 can be seen in fig . 3-25 .

3.6.4 wind turbine control

there has not been any recent research investigating this control approach . the past research was conducted for wind turbine control , but additional numerical computations and experiments should be conducted to further understand the aerodynamics and to find an optimal location and size . a control limitation of this device is that it is not possible to increase cl . stall strips operate in a similar manner to the microtabs and share some of the same concerns , mainly maintaining tight tolerances between the strip and the many body of the blade . although , air leakage isn ’ t a concern since the strips are only location on the suction surface . the forward location is beneficial from an implementation standpoint since there is plenty of space inside the blade to house an actuator ; however , major concerns arise from an aerodynamic perspective because slight modifications near the leading edge of the blade could have detrimental effects on the overall performance .

3.7 vortex generators
3.7.1 description

vortex generators ( vgs ) are simply solid tabs mounted on the airfoil surface that promote mixing and mitigate boundary layer separation . vgs that are appropriately sized and correctly oriented produce coherent helical vortex structures that cause mixing between the air in the freestream and boundary layer . 69 they are commonly used to reduce flow separation and increase clmax . however , at attached flow conditions conventional vgs significantly increase drag . examples of different vg types , including geometric parameters , are shown in fig . 3-26a ; a simple arrangement of ramp-style vgs on a wing section is displayed in fig . 3-26b .

fig . 3-26 a ) vg types and geometric parameters . ( source : lin et al.69 ) , b ) illusration of vg arrangement on a wing section . ( source : barrett and farokhi70 )

investigations in reducing the height of vgs found that under certain aerodynamic conditions , a properly designed “ micro vortex generator ” ( mvg ) can be just as effective in delaying separation in low speeds as a traditional vg.69 mvgs are defined as having a height between 10 % and 50 % of the boundary-layer thickness . the smaller size has the 70

advantage of incurring less drag compared to traditional vgs ; however , the generated vortices are not as strong and the placement of the mvg with respect to the flow separation region is much more critical . for these reasons , conventional vgs tend to be more effective . the mvgs are best for applications where the flow-separation location is relatively fixed ; in this situation they can be placed just upstream of the separation point .

3.7.3 background

although passive vgs are useful under certain conditions , active vgs have a greater potential for wind turbine control . experiments were conducted by barrett and farokhi 70 to demonstrate the potential benefits of active vgs , or smart vgs . the experiments used a ramp-style vg configuration with shape-memory-alloy ( sma ) actuators along with a shear-flow separation sensor and an optimal controller to form a smart vortex generator ( svg ) system to optimize lift-to-drag ratio ( l/d ) and clmax as a function of angle of attack .

71

investigations and experiments were conducted to determine the optimum shape , type , size , and placement of the ramp-style vgs on a naca 4415 airfoil section with an 8 in . chord at a chord reynolds number , re = 4.27 × 104. the vgs were placed 8-15 % c from the leading edge . the smart ramp vgs triggered by a leading-edge shear-flow sensor and controller , was capable of deploying the vgs to an operational height of 0.22 in . in 0.8 s while consuming 9.2 w of power . wind-tunnel results showed that clmax and αstall increased from clmax = 1.26 at α = 12.5° to clmax = 1.42 at α = 14.3° ( fig . 3-27a ) . the svg was able to adjust its height to maximize the lift-to-drag ratio ; the height ( in inches ) is also displayed in fig . 3-27a . the tests showed that the l/d ratio increased up to 42 % above α = 12.5° ( fig . 3-27b ) , while displaying a minimal change ( less than 0.1 % ) in drag . performance tests indicated that the active vortex generators were capable of both delaying stall and unstalling the airfoil . unstalling is achieved by activating the vgs during post-stall operation , when the flow is separated , to reattach the flow .

72

research on micro vortex generators ( mvgs ) as a means of flow-separation control has shown that properly designed devices can be just as effective in delaying separation as conventional vgs . lin 71 evaluated conventional and micro vgs by comparing oilflow visualization experiments conducted over a 2-d , 25°-sloped , backward-facing curved ramp in a shear flow tunnel . he studied several different types and sizes of mvgs and vgs and concluded that even though mvgs produce weaker vortices , properly designed mvgs would produce strong enough streamwise vortices to overcome separation and tended to be more efficient . the mvgs successfully reduced the extent of separation by almost 90 % . using vgs and mvgs as a means to suppress separation bubbles on a low reynoldsnumber aircraft was first investigated in the early 1990s . many low-reynolds number airfoils ( re < 1 million ) experience a laminar separation bubble for angles of attack below stall . the separation bubble is formed just downstream of the maximum suction pressure ; the laminar boundary layer separates and produces an unstable shear layer that rapidly transitions to a reattached turbulent boundary layer that continues to the trailing edge.69 small separation bubbles have little effect on lift but can create a significant increase in drag . an experimental investigation 72 was conducted on a liebeck la2573a airfoil using various mvg configurations to eliminate separation bubbles and reduce airfoil drag . results showed that significant drag reduction , over a range of lift coefficients , occurred for all three types of generators ( wishbone mvg with h/δ ~ 0.3 , ramp cone mvg with h/δ ~ 0.4 , wishbone vg with h/δ ~ 0.8 ) at the design condition . the mvgs showed a larger decrease in drag ( 38 % for a wishbone mvg ) compared to the traditional vgs ( 30 % reduction for wishbone vg ) .

73

3.7.4 wind turbine control

fixed vortex generators have been extensively researched and implemented on wind turbines , but not for active load control applications , rather they are typically installed near the root of the blade to mitigate inboard flow separation . however , active vgs could be placed in the outboard region of the blades and be used for control purposes by increasing clmax and αstall only when necessary . the implementation of active vgs would require actuators and slots in the blade . similar to other afc devices , the requirement for slots in the surface of the turbine blade raises concerns about possible reduced performance and noise generation . the forward placement of the vgs is advantageous because there is plenty of space to house an actuation system within a turbine blade . the main disadvantage of active vgs and the other ds devices is that they only are capable of delaying stall . delaying stall is not as desirable for control purposes as adjusting the entire lift curve as the i/d devices are able to do . one possible solution is to take corten ’ s24 idea ( described in the introduction of chapter 3 ) of passively applying vgs to wind turbine blades one step further and utilize actively controlled vgs , similar to the research conducted by barrett and farokhi70 . however , in this configuration the vgs would be normally deployed instead of normally retracted . the vgs could then retract in certain situations to reduce clmax and minimize loads ; the downside of using normally deployed vgs is that they increase drag at attached flow conditions . one advantage of this is to use design blades with shorter chords , this could save weight and cost on materials . this idea could possibly be applied to other ds devices discussed throughout this report .

3.8 blowing and suction
3.8.1 description

conventional blowing and suction techniques delay stall by adding high-momentum air into the boundary layer . blowing devices add stored high-momentum air through slots in the aerodynamic surface . suction devices remove low-momentum fluid near the surface , which deflects high-momentum free-stream fluid towards the surface , thus reenergizing the boundary layer . 73 the introduction of high-momentum air , from either blowing or suction , into the boundary layer assists in overcoming adverse pressure gradients , postponing separation . the blowing/suction slots can be located near the leading edge and/or near the trailing edge as shown in fig . 3-28. the slots are normally positioned in a near uniform fashion along the span of the blade and the blowing/suction can occur steadily or unsteadily . the presence of the slots can change the effective shape of the airfoil at higher angles of attack , causing an increase in drag ; however , at low angles of attack this is generally not an issue .

75

the slot , or jet , momentum coefficient defines the relative strength of blowing ( cμ > 0 ) and suction ( cμ < 0 ) .

( eqn . 8 )

& where m jet = ρjetvjetajet is the mass flow rate of air through the slot , vref is the reference

freestream velocity , and aref is the planform area . physically , this coefficient represents the ratio of slot momentum to free-stream momentum . pulsed operation is also possible . pulsed blowing sends short pulses rather than a continuous jet of fluid into the boundary layer and has been found to be more effective . the improved effectiveness is believed to come from the production of vorticity inside the boundary layer . this additional vorticity transports additional free-stream momentum into the boundary layer , therefore requiring less momentum to be injected through the slot itself . the reduced forcing frequency , f+ , is commonly used to characterize the ratio between the actuator forcing frequency and the frequency at which fluid events will be convected down the blade surface by the freestream flow . 74
f+ = f ⋅x v

3.8.3 background

the application of blowing for flow control on rotors has a long history with the first flight test occurring in 1955 on a cessna ch-1 helicopter . 75 recent experiments by seifert , daraby , nishri , and wygnanski 76 comparing steady and pulsed blowing leadingedge slots showed that pulsed blowing was more effective . a naca 0015 airfoil equipped with a leading-edge slot was tested for reynolds numbers between 150,000 and 750,000. the experiments showed that pure pulsed blowing from the leading edge at a very low momentum coefficient , cμ = 0.0008 , and at a reduced forcing frequency , f+ = 0.8 , increased the lift coefficient at α = 16° by 30 % relative to the non-blowing case . the steady blowing case with the same momentum coefficient did not show any effect . research conducted by weaver , mcalister , and tso 77 looked at the benefits of using steady and pulsed blowing to improve the dynamic stall characteristics of the airfoil . the boeing-vertol vr-7 airfoil ( used on helicopter rotors ) equipped with an upper surface blowing slot was used . the airfoil had a chord of 4.0 in . , a slot span of 7.9 in . , and a slot height of 0.003 in . the airfoil was tested in a water tunnel with a reynolds number of 100,000 and underwent sinusoidal pitching oscillations described by
α = αm + 10° sin ( ωt )
( eqn . 10 )

where α is the angle of attack , αm is the mean angle of attack , ω is the frequency of pitch oscillation , and t is time .

77

the experiments investigated αm values of 10° and 15° at reduced airfoil frequencies , k , from 0.005 to 0.15 ( ω is related to the reduced airfoil frequency through eqn . 4 ) . the reduced forcing frequency , f+ , ranged from 0 to 3 and the momentum coefficient , cμ , ranged from 0.03 to 0.66. unsteady lift , drag , and pitching-moment loads were measured , and fluorescent dye was used to visualize the flow . the results showed that steady , upper-surface blowing trapped a separation bubble near the leading edge during a portion of the airfoil ’ s upward rotation . the presence of the separation bubble was attributed to significantly enhancing the lift . the largest changes in cl were obtained at the lowest reduced airfoil frequencies , the lowest mean angle of attack , and the highest value of cμ . the performance decreased as the reduced frequency and mean angle of oscillation increased . pulsed blowing showed similar effectiveness and offered the largest

improvement at f+ = 0.9. under certain conditions , both blowing types increased the clmax ; pulsed blowing increased it by 20 % and steady blowing by 12 % .
3.8.4 wind turbine control

although these techniques have been successfully implemented on aircraft , there are many concerns related to wind turbine applications . the conventional design , using slots and stored high-momentum air , would be difficult to implement on turbine blades . main concerns would be added weight and complexity of spanwise slots and the need for compressed air storage . much of the research regarding conventional blowing and suction is now outdated ; however , past studies have paved the way for the development of other unconventional devices that use the same fundamental approach . these devices would be more appealing for turbine control and many of them are discussed later .

3.9 circulation control
3.9.1 description

circulation control is one concept derived from conventional blowing and suction research . the circulation control wing ( ccw ) was developed to increase the circulation , which increases the sectional lift coefficient of an airfoil . 78 the device is comprised of a series of thin high-velocity jets that blow high-momentum air tangentially over the rounded trailing-edge surface of an airfoil . under the influence of this jet , the boundary layer remains attached along the curved surface longer than usual and moves the rear stagnation point towards the pressure ( lower ) side of the airfoil thereby increasing the circulation around the entire airfoil . this flow phenomenon is called the coanda effect 79 , a balance of the pressure and centrifugal forces .

extensively

both

and

experimentally85-88 . to make earlier ccw designs more effective , the trailing edge of the airfoil was modified to have a rounded edge with a larger radius . the disadvantage of this modification was a high drag penalty while the jet was off.85 one solution to this was to make the lower surface of the trailing edge a flat surface , while keeping a highly curved upper surface.85

79

recent studies have focused on the potential benefits of ccw on wind turbine blades . tongchitpakdee , benjanirat , and sankar78 performed computational studies evaluating the performance of circulation control on the nrel phase vi rotor , which has s809 blade profiles . the nrel phase vi rotor , a stall-controlled hawt , has been successfully tested in the wind tunnel and used in the past as a validation tool for a number of numerical studies . prior to modeling circulation control , the flow solver was validated for the baseline case with the nrel rotor experimental database89-92 . calculations were performed for the nrel phase vi rotor at two wind speeds , 7 and 15 m/s , and three yaw angles , 0° , 10° , and 30° . the jet momentum coefficients ( eqn . 8 ) ranged from 0 to 0.10 .

fig . 3-29 computed streamlines over the airfoil at 7 m/s , 0° yaw . ( source : tongchitpakdee et al . 78 )

fig . 3-29 displays the change in the flow field , at a low wind speed of 7 m/s , as the jet momentum coefficient is increased , thus increasing circulation about the airfoil . the resulting deflection of the streamlines near the trailing edge can be observed in the figure . 80

the jet remains attached to the curved trailing edge , thereby improving the suction on the trailing-edge suction surface . the front stagnation point also is affected ; as cμ increases , the stagnation point moves further back on the pressure surface , and substantial turning of the flow outside of the boundary layer is observed . at 7 m/s , the flow was well behaved and fully attached over the blade , allowing the ccw to be effective . tests at the higher wind speed of 15 m/s did not prove as effective due to flow separation forward of the jet . liu84 evaluated the possibility of installing a second jet near the leading edge to prevent leading edge stall . he found that the combination of a blowing jet and a ccw could suppress 2-d airfoil stall and improve the effectiveness of the ccw at high angles of attack .
3.9.4 wind turbine control

much of the research on ccw is being conducted to produce large values of lift and therefore induce a larger loading to create more power . this strategy is not beneficial for load reduction . however , circulation control may potentially mitigate excessive loads if controlled properly or the device could be installed on the pressure surface of the airfoil . one major drawback of this system is the need to install air ducts running the length of the turbine blade to supply the jets with high-pressure air . a second drawback is the required rounded shape of the trailing edge , which results in increased drag and aeroacoustic noise due to vorticity shedding .

3.10 plasma actuators
3.10.1 description

surface non-thermal plasma actuators operate by creating an electric field between two electrodes , an anode ( + ) and a cathode ( - ) . by applying a large voltage difference between the electrodes , an electric field is formed and induces an “ electric wind ” , or “ ionic wind ” , close to the surface . the electric wind is formed by collisions between drifting ions and the neutral particles in the electrode gap region 93 . the induced wind acts as a body force and drives the nearby fluid , creating a zero-net mass flux ( znmf ) jet , modifying the boundary-layer airflow profile and postponing separation . the behavior of the actuators is dependent on geometrical parameters ( electrode shape and size , gap distances , etc ) , electrical parameters ( voltage , waveform and frequency if ac , etc ) , ambient air properties ( temperature , pressure , humidity , wind speed , etc ) , and the nature of the dielectric wall.91-9394 today , there are many different configurations that are classified as plasma actuators . new devices or different configurations are researched and developed every year . four configurations will briefly be discussed to develop a conceptual understanding of plasma actuator dynamics . the devices are 1 ) dc surface corona discharge , 2 ) ac surface dielectric barrier discharge , 3 ) sliding discharge , and 4 ) wall jet . the descriptions of these devices are discussed in further detail by moreau , benard , jolibois , and touchard 95 . the dc surface corona discharge actuator consists of two wire electrodes mounted flush on the surface of a dielectric profile ( fig . 3-30a ) . when a high dc voltage ( > 10 kv ) is applied , a corona is formed around the smaller diameter wire ( usually the anode ) and an electric wind is created tangential to the surface between the two electrodes . the

82

electric wind is capable of modifying the boundary-layer airflow profile . fig . 3-30b displays a visualization of a low velocity airflow along a flat plate . if the actuator is off , the smoke remains horizontal . when the actuator is active , flow above the anode is entrained towards the surface from the outer layer , causing the smoke to be drawn to the surface and then accelerated in the discharge region . the advantage of this device is that it requires a simple power supply , however the design is limited to an electric wind velocity of only a few m/s .

fig . 3-30 a ) schematic side view of the dc corona discharge actuator , b ) 2d visualization of manipulated airflow along a flat plate . ( source : moreau et al.93 )

the ac dielectric barrier discharge ( dbd ) is composed of two flat electrodes mounted on both sides of a dielectric material . one is grounded and the other is connected to a high ac voltage ( several kv ) with a frequency between 100 hz and several khz . a plasma sheet of blue ionized air is visible on the upper side of the dielectric as it extends between the two electrodes as shown in fig . 3-31. it looks like a quasi-uniform glow , but in fact it is constituted of micro discharges distributed uniformly in time and space along the electrode length . the electrical power consumption is slightly more than the dc surface coronas , but a higher electric wind velocity is generated and this can exert stronger effects on the local flow conditions .

the sliding discharge actuator is capable of generating a stable plasma sheet . it was first used for airflow applications by roth and sherman 96 . as shown in fig . 3-32a , it uses three plane electrodes ; two are flush mounted on the wall surface of a dielectric and exposed to the air ( # 1 and # 3 ) and the other ( # 2 ) is on the opposite side of the dielectric . electrodes # 2 and # 3 are connected together and usually grounded while electrode # 1 is excited . if a voltage with appropriate ac and dc components is applied to electrode # 1 , a plasma sheet is formed as shown in fig . 3-32 .

the plasma wall jet or plasma synthetic jet was introduced by jukes , choi , johnson , and scott 97 in 2004 and is illustrated in fig . 3-33a . this device uses two air exposed surface electrodes and one covered electrode to create two separate surface dielectric barrier discharges . if electrodes # 1 and # 3 are excited by the same high voltage , a plasma jet perpendicular to the surface is created . if the electrodes are excited by two different voltages , the angle of the jet is modified . for example , if vac1 > vac2 , the jet is deflected to the right ( fig . 3-33 ) . this configuration is different from to the other plasma 84

actuation devices ; instead of generating a plasma region parallel to the wall it creates a vertical wall jet that penetrates into the boundary layer . the wall jet is able to generate vortices in the boundary layer , which improves the effectiveness of the device by increasing the mixing between the free-stream flow and boundary layer flow . another important feature of the plasma synthetic jet actuator is that it can easily be reversed to act as a suction or blowing device . recent studies have analyzed the performance of different electrode configurations , including pulsed operation . 98,99

3.10.3 background

the use of plasma actuators as a means of aerodynamic flow control is a relatively new concept . before 2000 , there were few published works on the topic . the first significant scientific papers were published in 1968 by velkoff and ketchman 100 and in 1978 by yabe , mori , and hijikata 101 . it was not until the mid 1990 ’ s that research began to take off and a few research groups analyzed airflow control using the most basic plasma actuator device , dc surface corona discharge . 102,103 in 1998 , roth , sherman , and wilkinson96 published their first results pertaining to a surface dielectric barrier discharge 85

( dbd ) . the initial research on surface plasma and the development of these simple devices allowed many researchers in aerodynamics to study the effects of plasma actuators without being a specialist in plasma generation . this has led to considerable growth in the field since 2000. now more than 30 groups are working in the field and over 150 papers have been published to date . a more detailed background on the development of plasma actuators can be found in moreau91 . 104,105,106,107,108,109,110 corke and his fellow researchers have been researching separation control over airfoils with plasma actuators for the past 5 years104-110 . their first publication104 looked at using a single dbd actuator for flow control ; results showed that a measurable lift increase occurred over a range of angles of attack accompanied by an increase in drag . the plasma effect was compared to a slight increase in camber . another study105

compared the use of passive mechanical vortex generators with a plasma-based active method . the airfoil used was a naca 663-018 with a chord of c = 12.7 cm . different actuator locations were tested , one at the leading edge ( x/c = 0 ) and the second at x/c = 0.5. reynolds numbers ranged from 79,000 < re < 158,000. the primary result was that the actuators delayed stall by 8° with up to a 400 % improvement in lift-to-drag ratio . results indicate that the optimum location for plasma actuators is close to the leading edge .

86

since 2003 , corke et al . have conducted

105-107

numerous

experiments on flow control on the naca 0015 airfoil and have shown that stall can be

successfully delayed . one study obtained the lift curve of an airfoil fig . 3-34 comparison of computed lift coefficient with with a dbd actuator powered on corke106 )
plasma on and off , re = 158,000 . ( source : post and

and off ( fig . 3-34 ) . the results showed that the plasma actuator successfully delayed stall and increased cl for α > 15° . moreau et al.91 brought up the concern that past experiments could not explain if the delayed stall was due to the plasma actuators adding momentum into the boundary layer or was due to the laminar to turbulent transition induced by the presence of the actuators causing the boundary layer to trip . they showed that the plasma actuators were , in fact , capable of preventing flow separation and promoting flow reattachment . this work also showed that actuators were most effective when placed near the separation point , similar to vortex generators and other flow separation mitigation devices . jolibois , forte , and moreau 111 also investigated the optimal location for plasma actuators . the study involved seven independent dbd plasma actuators mounted on the suction side of a 1 m chord naca 0015 airfoil . to prevent uncertainty about the flow transitioning due to the physical presence of the actuator , the researchers tripped the flow at the leading edge with a turbulator . flow visualizations and piv measurements were recorded to further understand the physical effect of each actuator . this study concluded

87

that the optimum location for effectiveness and efficiency was at the separation point . however , this is difficult to achieve , as the natural separation point of an airfoil will change as a function of the angle of attack and reynolds number . fig . 3-35 illustrates the streamlines of the time-averaged airflow over an airfoil at
α = 15° . in the absence of plasma acutation , the airflow naturally separates at x/c = 0.45 .

when a downstream actuator ( x/c = 0.70 ) is activated , the airflow partially reattaches and the separation point is shifted to x/c = 0.55 , demonstrating that these actuators retain their effectiveness even when not optimally placed .

fig . 3-36 presents the velocity profiles on a flat plate at a free-stream velocity of 5 m/s for both numerical and experimental studies . the experimental study compared the velocity profiles of different plasma electric current values . increasing the current generates a more powerful electric wind and has a greater effect on local velocity . the numerical study illustrated the change in the velocity profile due to a dc actuator that acted in both co-flow and counter-flow directions . the results showed that the plasma actuators are capable of increasing or decreasing the localized velocity near the flat plate . the free-stream velocity used in these studies was relatively low . fig . 3-37 shows that plasma actuators do not have such an impact on the velocity profile when the free-stream velocity is increased . 88

3.10.4 wind turbine control

plasma actuators have received considerable attention over the recent years as a practical flow control device due to their advantages over fluidic and mechanical devices . they are able to directly convert electrical energy into kinetic energy , which is used to modify the airflow . they have advantages over mechanical devices ; the device is simple , lightweight and uses no moving parts ; therefore , it is likely not be a source of vibration or noise . unlike fluidic devices , plasma actuators do not require a source of high89

momentum air . therefore , compressed air storage and plumbing running the length of a turbine blade is not needed . research has also shown that the presence of the electrodes does not interfere with the surrounding airflow when inactive and major modifications to the turbine blade are not required for installation . another feature is that plasma actuators can be designed to operate in co-flow and counter-flow conditions , which allows for more options when controlling localized flow . the primary disadvantages are maintaining a stable plasma region , low efficiency and the requirement of high voltage lines running inside the turbine blades . under certain conditions and configurations , maintaining a stable electric wind can be difficult . plasma devices have reduced performance in higher wind speeds . in fact , studies91 indicate that the performance is quite low at a wind speed of 17 m/s , whereas other afc devices have proved effective at wind speeds above 30 m/s . this is one area that advancements in plasma actuators need to be made . another area for improvement is the energy conversion efficiency . the energy conversion from electrical to kinetic energy has a low efficiency ( a few percent91 ) ; a large part of the electrical power goes into gas heating rather than direct gas motion .

3.11 vortex generator jets
3.11.1 description 112,113,114,115

vortex generator jets ( vgjs ) are jets of air that pass through a wall ( the skin of an airfoil ) and into a crossflow to create a dominant streamwise vortex.112-115 the vortex remains

momentum air from the undisturbed flow into the boundary layer . this process helps mitigate boundary-layer separation and leads to an increase in clmax and αstall . the vortex created by the vgj and the traditional vg is very similar ; however , the vgj is more controllable and less intrusive . a schematic of a simple vgj is shown in fig . 3-38 .

in 1990 , lin , howard , and bushnell 117 studied various passive and active methods for controlling two-dimensional turbulent separated flows . the vgjs were found to be the most effective method investigated at that time . the vgj was compared to the traditional solid vortex generator and found to produce similar benefits but without any additional

91

drag penalty . johnston and nishi113 researched spanwise arrays of vgjs and showed that arrays were effective in reducing the size of the separated regions of the flow . in 1992 , compton and johnston115 determined that a vortex produced from a single vgj resembled the vortex produced by a traditional solid vortex generator , but the vgj vortex tended to decay at a slightly faster rate downstream . 118,119,120,121,122 additional research focused on the development of a pulsed vortex generator jet ( pvgj ) , which has been found to be more effective and efficient in delaying stall.118-122 this is due to both the enhanced vorticity production associated with the impulsively started jet flow and to the reduction in mass flow due to a reduced duty cycle , or pulse cycle ( typically 10 % to 50 % ) . the pulsing system can be designed to readily adjust three parameters ; the pulsing frequency , the jet velocity ratio , and the duty cycle . these parameters can be optimized to produce coherent structures that maximize energy addition into the boundary layer to prevent separation . the advantages of pvgjs are actively being investigated for application in several fields , including aircraft , low-pressure gas turbines ( lpt ) and unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) . magill and mcmanus 123 showed that this flow control method can enhance the lift , and hence the maneuverability , of advanced military fighters in post-stall flight . the pvgjs increased lift ( clmax increased by 7 % ) and l/d ratio , while minimizing additional drag . other research conducted by magill and mcmanus 124 demonstrated separation control in a subsonic flow over a naca 4412 airfoil equipped with a simple leadingedge flap . the maximum lift coefficient was increased by more than 20 % under however , this increase was severely degraded if the pulsing

bons , sondergaard , and rivir74,125,126 performed studies with both steady and pulsed jets on a lpt model . these studies showed that vgjs could reduce wake losses up to 5065 % . other learned items were that the key mechanism to properly control pvgjs is the starting and stopping of the pulses rather than the injection itself and that pulsing may play a reduced role at higher reynolds number . heinzen , hall , and chokani 127 investigated the effectiveness of both vgj and pvgj systems on an unmanned air vehicle ( uav ) wing . the effectiveness of delaying stall was measured by pressure distribution changes on the top surface of the wing . experiments in both the wind tunnel and in flight were carried out . the pvgjs were placed on the leading edge of the flap and were activated to test their ability to delay the onset of stall . the results showed that pvgjs were effective at delaying stall and the best results occurred when the reduced frequencies ( eqn . 9 ) , f+ , were near unity . when implemented in a test flight , the pvgjs increased lift and enhanced control at high angles of attack .

tensi , bourgois , bonnet , breux , and siauw 128 recently investigated stall delay on a naca 0015 airfoil equipped with vgjs jets mounted on the upper side of the model at a chord location , x/c , of 30 % . the jets were found to introduce strong streamwise vortices into the flow . the test setup had vgj pitch and skew angles of 30° and 60° , respectively , and flow conditions of v∞ = 40 m/s and re = 0.93 × 106. the angle of attack , α , ranged from 9° to 16° and jet momentum coefficient , cμ , ( eqn . 8 ) from 0 to 0.9 % . several tests were carried out analyzing the change in cl and cd and the amount of separation delay . results ( fig . 3-39 ) indicated that

another design concept that has been derived from the traditional vortex generator is the high-frequency micro vortex generator ( himvg ) . similar in operation to the pvgjs , the himvg uses mechanical motion to generate periodic vortices . these vortices cause high-momentum streamwise air to be driven towards the surface , thus energizing the boundary layer and mitigating separation . the vortices are created by a mechanical element ( or micro vortex generator ) that oscillates rapidly within the boundary layer at a certain frequency . fig . 3-41 displays one design of a himvg system that uses a piezoelectric actuator and a compliant structure to rapidly oscillate the vortex generator blade .

3.12.3 background

as mentioned earlier , the development of the himgv can be traced back to the traditional vg , but more specifically to the micro vortex generator ( mvg ) , a compact version of the traditional vg . lin69,71 conducted research on reducing the size of vortex generators to sub-boundary layer heights ( 0.2 to 0.4 times the boundary-layer height ) , while still maintaining their effectiveness . lin ’ s optimized mvg shapes were used for the himgv design because of their small size and light weight , which allowed the

96

himvg to rapidly oscillate at high frequencies . other studies that were critical in the development of the himvg include the research conducted on pvgjs and the periodic excitation control studies by seifert , darabi , and wygnanski 129 . the fundamental

difference between the himvgs and the pvgjs is that the latter uses high- fig . 3-41 schematic of a himvg system . ( source : 131
osborn et al . )

momentum air as the working medium to produce the unsteady excitation , whereas the physical presence and mechanical motion of the himvgs creates the unsteady excitation . in 1995 , the air force research laboratory developed a first generation himvg 130 with limited oscillation frequency of 10-20 hz . this frequency range was found to lie well below the requirement for optimum separation control ; however it was adequate to confirm that separation control was feasible and was used for static testing of the vortex generator array . in 2004 , a second generation himvg was built and tested by a collaboration of flexsys , inc.31 , the university of michigan , and the u.s. air force research laboratory . 131 the system design used displacement amplification compliant structures , coupled with an appropriate actuator , to increase the deployment frequency . the design was capable of oscillating mvgs at the optimum frequencies and amplitudes needed for separation control for different flow fields . the compliant structure had a displacement

97

amplification of 20:1 , which enabled a deployment height of 5 mm ( 0.4 times the boundary layer height ) to be reached . the system , consisting of two voicecoil actuators and seven blades , was capable of operating
fig . 3-42 himvg dynamic test results for u∞ = 70 ft/s .

between 0 and 90 hz . the model ( source : osborn et al.131 )

consisted of a flat plate with a rounded leading edge and a variable angle trailing-edge flap at 65 % c . the flap was used to separate the flow while the himvg system , mounted on the flat plate portion of the model , attempted to keep the flow attached even when it passed the deployed flap . a surface-mounted static pressure array measured pressures during the experiments . a higher pressure measurement indicated a strongly attached flow and a lower pressure measurement indicated flow detachment . the system was tested in the wind tunnel at wind speeds of 55 ft/s and 70 ft/s in the university of michigan subsonic wind tunnel . results of the 70 ft/s test case can be seen in fig . 3-42. the figure shows that maximum cp ( indicating a strongly attached flow ) was achieved at a deployment frequency of 60 hz . similar to the results from the pvgj study127 , the himvg system performed optimally ( large improvement in pressure recovery ) when the reduced forcing frequency ( eqn . 9 ) , f+ , was near unity . the dynamic operation of the system was more effective at avoiding boundary layer separation than was conventional static deployment , reinforcing the concept that the addition of periodic excitation into a separating turbulent-

98

boundary layer increases the momentum transfer across the shear layer , enhancing its resistance to separation under adverse pressure gradients.131 periodic excitation

improved the lift , even when it did not fully eliminate separated flow . 132 future work identified by the researchers131 includes replacing the voice-coil actuators with suitable piezoelectric actuators to allow for a maximum frequency of 240 hz .
3.12.4 wind turbine control

the results show promise for himvgs as a means of active flow control . as a first step towards turbine control applications , computational and experimental studies should be conducted on wind turbine airfoils and flow conditions to ensure the technology will be effective . the advantage of using these devices rather than fluidic devices is that there is no need for a compressed air system . this simplifies the overall design , eases

implementation , and reduces system weight . the location of the device is advantageous because there is plenty of space inside the blade to house the actuation system . the total system would require minimal power since the compliant structure allows for a small force and a short actuation distance . concerns with this design are similar to those for the microtab , in that tight tolerances are required . when the device is inactive , gaps between the blade and the himvg could create noise and reduced performance , especially since the device is located nearer to the leading edge . degradation of the compliant structure over time may also be of concern .

the first synthetic jet that was integrated into an aerodynamic surface was developed by james , jacobs , and glezer133 in 1996. the researchers investigated the formation of synthetic jets using an oscillating diaphragm mounted flush on a flat plate submerged in water . these experiments showed that the jets are produced entirely from radially

entrained fluid . the jets were observed as small clusters of cavitation bubbles appearing and subsequently collapsing near the center of the diaphragm during each oscillation cycle . numerous researchers have since investigated the aerodynamic qualities of synthetic jets and integration of synthetic jets into flow control systems . a number of publications have been written on synthetic jets in both experimental134-137 and numerical studies138-140 . experiments by seifert , bachar , koss , shepshelovich , and wygnanski 141 investigated a naca 0015 airfoil equipped with unsteady suction and blowing near the leading edge tangential to the surface . the study consisted of wind-tunnel tests at high angles of attack , where the airfoil would reach maximum lift and eventually stall , creating a wake region above the aft region of the airfoil . the test showed a significant increase in maximum lift when using a relatively low momentum input . observations also showed synthetic jets caused reattachment of the flow in the trailing-edge region . numerical simulations have supported some of the experimental findings . donovan , kral , and cary 142 simulated the experiments of seifert et al141 . using an unsteady reynolds averaged navier-stokes ( rans ) incompressible flow solver with a turbulence model , they found that a significant lift increase , about 29 % , in the post-stall regime could be obtained using synthetic jets . performance was improved when the actuator was placed close to the airfoil leading edge . further studies by ravindran 143 confirmed that 101

unsteady tangential suction and blowing could be used for separation control and that the lift increased as the blowing coefficient , cµ , increased . recent experiments by tensi et al.128 showed the positive effect of synthetic jets on the reattachment of a separated boundary layer . the low-speed wind tunnel tests were conducted on a naca 0015 airfoil equipped with synthetic jets located at x/c = 20 % . in total , 61 injectors with a pitch of 30° relative to the wall and diameters of d = 3 mm were installed into the model . three non- synthetic jet operation ( cu = 1.94 % , f+ = 6.7 ) .

dimensional frequencies , f+ = 3.2 , 4.5 , and 6.7 , were tested over a range of angles of attack with an air velocity of u∞ = 6 m/s ( re = 0.4 × 106 ) . qualitative observations were made using tomoscopy observations and piv ( particle imaging velocimetry ) measurements ; some results can be seen in fig . 3-44 and fig . 3-45. piv technology is an optical method used to take accurate , quantitative measurements of the speed fields of the seeded airflow from the data on vortex trajectories . the efficiency of the jet system was also quantified by comparing the extent of separation shown in piv measurements .

3.13.4 wind turbine control

the unique attributes of synthetic jets , coupled with the development of actuators that are easily integrated into the aerodynamic surface , make synthetic jets attractive for active flow control . the system consists of small actuators that require minimal power . no

compressed air lines are needed ; this simplifies the system and reduces the weight . the location ( ~20 % c ) of the actuators is advantageous for installation and actuator housing and is not too close to the leading edge where problems may arise from slight airfoil modifications . investigations on wind turbine airfoils and flow conditions should be conducted to study the effectiveness of synthetic jets for load control . the presence of the cavities

may interfere with the flow patterns while the device is inactive , thereby generating noise and decreasing performance . tight tolerances would be necessary to limit the

interference . other concerns are decreased performance due to soiling and icing of the blades .

3.14 active flexible wall
3.14.1 description

the micro-flexural active flexible wall ( afw ) 144 is a device that detects the onset of boundary layer separation and introduces small disturbances into the boundary layer near the leading edge of the airfoil to counteract the growth of flow separation . the device consists of an array of transducers that are mounted inside a flexible housing , made of an inner wall and an outer wall . the entire system is thin ( 50-100 microns ) and the flexible housing is affixed to the leading edge of an aerodynamic surface in such a way that it is virtually non-intrusive to the flow when not actuated . the device provides an active flow separation control system that locally interacts with the boundary-layer flow and is capable of operating in two modes : a sensor mode and an actuator mode.144 in sensor mode , the system is able to detect small disturbances in the flow that occur when the flow begins to separate from the trailing edge . in actuator mode , the transducers are activated and begin to vibrate the outer surface of the housing , causing small perturbations in the flow . the controller is capable of using spatial location and frequency content of the input signals to determine which transducers to excite and at what frequency in order to prevent or delay flow separation . the transducers selected for activation are typically immediately upstream of the separation point .

small mechanical vibrations create perturbations on the airfoil surface , generating vortices located near the leading edge of the blade used to delay stall unsteady operation

104

3.14.3 background

the physical model ( fig . 3-46 ) consisted of a flexible housing with an outer layer made of 6μm thick mylar sheet with an aluminum coating and an inner layer of 0.02 mm thick polyamide sheet . the transducers were made of copper strips of two different sizes ( high and low ) to provide upper and lower limits for the vibrating mylar sheet . the high and low strips were alternatively spaced about 1 mm apart . the afw was attached to the leading edge of a naca 0012 airfoil . the system was capable of operating in both sensor mode and actuator mode . in the sensing mode , a dc bias ( 90v ) is applied between the mylar and high copper strips ; flow induced vibrations of the membrane can be detected as an induced ac signal picked up from the mylar and the copper strip of interest . in the actuation mode , an ac signal ( 8-48 khz , ~150 vrms ) is applied to copper strips located near the separation point ; this induces micro-flexural vibrations of the flexible mylar membrane at the two points of actuation . the displacement amplitudes of the membrane were typically on the order of 0.1 μms , about three orders of magnitude smaller than the boundary layer thickness . the power consumption for this setup was about 30 w for a 30 cm span . investigations looked at using the afw device to delay stall during static 145 and dynamic situations 146 . wind tunnel experiments were conducted using a naca 0012 airfoil equipped with distributed pressure tabs . the model had a chord of 291 mm and a span of 450 mm . static stall experiments found that the optimum excitation location was just forward of the separation location . this location corresponded to x/c = 0.03 for test conditions of re = 57,800 and α = 15.5° . the optimum excitation frequency was found to be 3.4 khz , twice the frequency of the ac actuation signal . at optimum conditions ,

the separation was delayed , causing a 4 % increase in the section lift coefficient , cl . the dynamic stall experiments used the same airfoil with flow conditions of re = 6.13 × 105 and a reduced airfoil frequency , k , ( eqn . 4 ) of 0.105. two strips were excited at frequencies of 8 , 20 , 24 , and 48 khz . results showed the afw system could delay airfoil stall by 9 % ( from α = 19.6° to 21.4° ) .

3.14.4 wind turbine control

the main advantages of this device are that it can be applied to a turbine blade without major modifications , has low power requirements , does not affect the flow when inactive and can operate in both sensor and actuation mode . further investigations on the ability to control wind turbine loads using both the sensor and actuation mode of this device should be conducted . the afw is located very near the leading edge and at that location potential problems may arise if the device becomes soiled or damaged .

3.15 shape change airfoil
3.15.1 description 147,148,149

the shape change airfoil , or adaptive airfoil , operates by physically changing the shape of an airfoil . piezoelectric material is used to form part of the upper surface of the airfoil and , as it deforms , the camber changes . the design by munday and jacob147-149 is shown in fig . 3-47. this particular design has the actuators mounted within the airfoil such that the free end of the piezoelectric material lines up with the main part of the airfoil when the actuator is at its smallest effective radius ( most curved ) . a thin plastic sheet is placed over the actuator to smooth the profile and the entire assembly is wrapped in a latex membrane to hold it together and eliminate seams . when the actuators are deployed to the greatest effective radius ( close to being flat ) , they push against the upper cross-section and physically change the camber . the system is designed to operate by rapidly deploying and retracting the piezoelectric actuators ; this motion not only modifies the camber of the airfoil but also generates vortices in the flow about the airfoil ( fig . 3-48 ) . the vortices convect

downstream while entraining high-momentum free-stream air into the boundary layer , thereby postponing separation .

physical changes in the camber are used to generate vortices located near mid chord increases lift only modest improvements are seen in steady operation , unsteady operation is more effective

3.15.3 background

the first experiments with the shape change airfoil were conducted by pinkerton and moses 150 in 1997. their objective was to assess the ability of a new piezoelectric actuator to alter the upper surface geometry of a subscale airfoil . the piezoelectric actuator , called thunder43 , was developed by nasa and is capable of larger bending displacements ( several mm ) than previous piezoelectric actuators . the goal was to use thunder to change the airfoil ’ s camber , which , in turn , would adjust the local flow field around the airfoil to increase maximum lift and delay stall . the study focused on the feasibility of the actuator rather than aerodynamic performance . research in 2002 expanded upon the concept and looked into the aerodynamics and optimal control strategies . a modular test section was built using the base profile of a naca 4415 and the actuation system as described previously in section 3.15.1. munday and jacob147 analyzed the effects of static shape changes ( the actuator remained stationary at a number of pre-determined positions ) by collecting force and piv measurements . they concluded that only modest improvement in l/d can be achieved 108

with static actuator positions . maximum actuator displacement slightly increased both lift and drag and increased l/d by 2 % . pern 151 investigated a circular-arc airfoil and showed that an airfoil with an oscillating , rather than a fixed , camber setting would produce higher lift coefficients . this improved performance was due to vortex generation ; the oscillating motion created a series of vortices that added momentum and entrained the flow above the boundary layer towards the surface . the boundary-layer thickness downstream of the vortex source was drastically reduced because the flow was energized and remained attached , despite the adverse pressure gradient . if only one vortex was created , the flow would lose quickly momentum and separate due to the adverse pressure gradient . by oscillating the upper surface , vortices were continually generated and traveled downstream , adding to the energy of the flow and overcoming the adverse pressure gradient . 152 additional experiments149 evaluated the performance of a naca 4415 airfoil equipped with the shape change system by measuring the separated flow thickness at 70 % c using smoke-wire flow visualization . researchers conducted a series of low-speed wind tunnel tests at re = 2.5 × 104 and 5.0 × 104 , angles of attack of 0° , 3° , 6° and 9° , and at reduced frequencies f+ ( eqn . 9 ) ranging from 0 to 11. flow visualization showed that the uncontrolled airfoil experienced large separation ; however , oscillating the curvature of the upper surface reduced flow separation . oscillating the surface with a small

amplitude of 0.002c reduced the size of the separated flow region by 30-60 % as compared to flow over a similarly shaped static wing .

expanded upon the previous tests by evaluating the performance under a wider range of flow conditions , actuation frequencies and amplitudes . the angle of attack was varied between 0° and 24° at re = 2.5 × 104 , 5.0 × 104 , 7.5 × 104 and 1.0 × 105. in this experiment , there were four modules , each with a chord length of 0.203 m , connected together to form a span of 0.33 m. in this

configuration , the actuator could change the profile of the suction surface by about 0.01c . the

maximum deflection of 3 mm peak to peak occurred at x/c = 0.45 .

fig . 3-49 lift and drag characteristics at re = 1.0 x 105. increasing the camber when the angle ( source : pern et al.152 )

of attack , α , was between 4° and 20° resulted in an increase in l/d . the measured lift and drag characteristics for f+ = 0 , 0.1 , and 0.2 at re = 1.0 × 105 are shown in fig . 3-49. increases in cl were much more prominent for the lower reynolds number test cases . observations from flow visualization and smoke-wire visualization ( fig . 3-50 ) showed that the oscillating frequency was the main factor for flow control . the researchers also

110

suggested that a significant reduction in separated flow occurred at frequencies f+ > 0.1. cfd analysis showed good qualitative agreement in the development of the vortex with the wind-tunnel experiments . the location of vortex formations was at about x/c = 0.5 in both computational and experimental studies .

3.15.4 wind turbine control

this concept has shown promise in both computational and experimental studies . the shape change airfoil has a smooth deployment area , giving it an advantage over other methods which require holes or slots in the exterior skin of the airfoil . there would be minimal problems associated with noise generation and reductions in performance due to soiling . the greatest hurdle of this concept is that the piezoelectric material covers a large portion of the chord . this could be problematic with implementation on full-sized blades and could have detrimental effects on the overall structural integrity . difficulties with

111

using deforming piezoelectric actuators can also arise from the requirement for a highvoltage source and reduced performance over time due to creep .

3.16 device summary
active flow control is a rapidly growing field and with numerous devices being investigated . it is impossible to list all of the devices that could be used for future wind turbine control ; however , this report attempted to introduce some of the most promising devices . overall , fifteen ( 15 ) potentially useful devices were discussed . a description of how the device works , both aerodynamically and mechanically , was presented . a classification system was created to help separate the devices and a brief research background on each device was included . comparisons between each device are difficult to make because they are all at varying stages of research and are applied to different fields . however , their advantages and disadvantages related to possible wind turbine control were discussed . the main characteristic that separates the devices into two classes is how they adjust the lift curve ; either by delaying stall ( ds ) or by shifting the curve up or down ( i/d ) . since wind turbines normally operate in the linear region of the lift curve , the devices that have the most promise for load alleviation are i/d devices . however it was shown that ds devices could still be used . investigations into the afc devices have shown that there is substantial potential for the improvement of wind turbine control . the purpose of this report was not to directly compare devices or recommend the most viable device for turbine control ; instead it was meant to provide the reader with a global view of today ’ s research that could make significant contributions to wind turbine control in the future . as research progresses , specific flow control devices will begin to

112

stand out as viable options for load control . of course , the true test of an afc device will be a field demonstration on a large-scale wind turbine . at this time , field tests are many years away and more research is needed before this can be achieved .

conclusion
the wind industry is rapidly growing and signs indicate that it will remain this way

for years to come . as the industry has grown , so has the size of the turbines . significant growth has made it impossible to control turbines passively as they were controlled in the past ; therefore , modern turbines rely on sophisticated control systems to assure safe and optimal operation under a variety of atmospheric conditions . as the rotors continue to grow in size , the industry needs to make yet another shift in their approach to turbine control by considering localized flow control along the blades . larger rotors experience more pronounced structural and fatigue loading , particularly in turbulent winds . this loading can have a detrimental effect on the rotor and surrounding components and can lead to an increase in o & m and a decrease in turbine life . implementing new load control techniques could decrease excessive loads , which are key factors in turbine life . the afc devices introduced in this report are possible solutions to these issues . these devices are small , lightweight , and can actuate at speeds that can counter the loading from turbulent winds . improved control could lead to increased turbine life , reduced required materials , improved energy capture , better overall performance , and reduced coe of wind energy . lowering coe ensures competitive prices against traditional and other renewable energy sources and the continued maturation of the industry .

the logistics of transporting wind turbines
reducing inefficiencies , costs and community impact by streamlining the supply chain

w hite paper 2009

with the focus on renewable energy worldwide , the rising cost of traditional energy , increased concerns about global warming and government support of alternative energy sources ; wind power is becoming more popular and growing as a viable sustainable energy business segment . however , several challenges face this developing industry . because of the unusual length , shape and weight of wind energy components , logistics and transportation are complex and extremely expensive . this white paper will look at the logistical challenges facing wind energy components , and the advantage of using an experienced transportation provider to help reduce inefficiencies , costs and community impact by streamlining the supply chain .
the winds of change - demand and the industry

according to the canadian wind energy association ( canwea ) , “ wind power keeps improving in big and small ways . advances in technology and soaring global energy costs are making wind power a clean and viable option for big and small energy producers everywhere . ”
1

“ from major power producers looking for cleaner ways to produce energy for the grid to inventive companies searching for alternative ways to power their plants – even down to the individual who wants to live off-grid – it ’ s the people who believe in wind who power it . ” 2 in early 2008 , world wind capacity reached 121,188 mw , that ’ s the equivalent of producing enough electricity to power 37 million households . according to the world energy council , if the current growth rate continues , global capacity will reach 190,000 mw by 2010 . 3 as the need for cleaner and cheaper energy grows , the industry continues to grow . worldwide it was worth over 40 billion € in 2008. the true potential for growth really is astounding , with the industry now doubling in size every three years . 4

how big is big ?

to understand and appreciate the logistics of transporting such massive parts it helps to understand the makeup of a wind turbine . the specs for a 1.8 mw turbine provided by the canadian wind energy association ( canwea ) : • • • • • • the nacelle ( generator components ) is the size of a small motor home and weighs 63,000 kg ( 138,891 lb ) . each blade is 39 m ( 128 ' ) long – the same length as a boeing 737 , and the 3-blade rotor weighs 35,000 kg ( 77,162 lb ) . the 65 m ( 213 ' ) tower is made up of rolled steel and comes in three pieces . the entire tower weighs 132,000 kg and contains enough steel to manufacture 206 average cars . the foundation concrete is 9 – 10 m ( 33 ' ) deep and 4 m ( 13 ' ) across . 102 tension type bolts run the full depth of the foundation . swept area of the blades is 5,024 sq . m , ( 16,483 ' ) the size of 3 nhl hockey rinks combined or about 1.25 acres . total weight of the entire turbine is 230,000 kg ( 507,063 lb ) – about the same as two fully fueled 3,200 hp diesel electric locomotives . this is just one example , however even the wind turbine components above are often even bigger than this .

the logistics , not exactly a breeze

understanding the size of wind turbines provides an appreciation for the complexity of their transportation . a single turbine can require up to 8 loads ( one nacelle , one hub , three blades and three tower sections ) . for an entire project of 150 mw , transportation requirements have been as much as 689 truckloads , 140 railcars and 8 vessels to the united states . and , many projects today are much larger than 150 mw ( the largest operating project in the us is currently 736 mw , and projects of more than 4,000 mws are in the early stages of development ) . 5 it is no wonder that one of the biggest challenges facing the industry are the logistics of transporting such oversized parts sometimes over extremely long distances . among the issues ; traffic backups , road damage , coordination and cost . traffic congestion as suggested in a recent article in the new york times , “ as demand for clean energy grows , towns around the country are finding their traffic patterns roiled as convoys carrying disassembled towers that will reach more than 250 feet ( 76.2 m ) in height , as well as motors , blades and other parts roll through . escorted by patrol cars and gawked at by pedestrians , the equipment must often travel hundreds of miles from ports or factories to the remote , windy destinations where the turbines are erected . ” 6 road damage normal wear and tear of any road is expected over time , but whenever there is extensive pressure and constant flow of traffic , road damage becomes inevitable . in texas for example , the state with the most wind turbines , the constant truck traffic is tearing up small roads in the western part of the state , where the turbines are being rapidly erected .

complex coordination moving wind turbine components to a project site is not easy . it involves handling sensitive and expensive components that are very heavy and very big . this requires extensive coordination , communication and scheduling between logistics providers , railroads , trucking companies , port operators , barge and ocean vessel owners , among others . high cost on a per-turbine basis , the cost of transportation and logistics generally varies from around $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 , said john dunlop , an engineer with the american wind energy association . and since recent wind farm projects are getting larger , costs will also grow . transborder complications when moving wind turbines from one continent to another and across state and provincial lines , you are bound to run into unpredictable situations . most countries , states and provinces require shippers to have different permits in order to move over-sized cargo . this can be a difficult situation if the proper paper work is not obtained for each provincial or state regulations .

selecting your site the information in this section gives specifics about the ideal sitting of the wind turbine tower , if your area does not have an ideal location , find the best location possible . remember correct sitting will increase both efficiency and safety . small increases in average wind speeds result in dramatic increases in energy output of the wind generator . for example , an increase in wind speed of 10 % ( 9 mph - 10 mph ; 4 m/s - 4.5 m/s ) results in approximately a 30 % increase in the power available from the wind . therefore , the better the location the better the performance . as a rule , the wind generator should be mounted as high and as far away from obstructions as possible . this will create a clear wind channel . two basic requirements for a good wind generator site : • good average wind speed • low wind turbulence the lower the turbulence , the less stress your wind generator will sustain , the longer it will last and the more energy it will produce . turbulence is created by obstructions . keep the following in mind when considering siting : • a tower immediately downwind of a building should be at least 20 ft ( 6.0 m ) above the height of the building . • the tower should be 20 ft ( 6.0 m ) higher than any barrier within a 500 ft ( 152.4 m ) radius . wind speed your wind generator will produce energy when there is wind . a photovoltaic ( pv ) solar panel will produce energy when the solar is plentiful . this is typical of seasonal changes . when it is sunny it is calm ; when it is cloudy it is windy . for your wind generator to produce energy , average wind speed at your site should be at least 6mph : 6 miles/hour =2.68 meters/second . if winds in your area are less than 6 mph , you might look to install a photovoltaic ( pv ) system next to your wind generator creating a hybrid renewable energy system . topography if your location is basically flat , topography is not in issue when deciding where to place your wind generator . there are circumstances where the highest land available may not be the best place for your wind generator . highest land nearby may be awkward to get to , may be too far away from where you need the power , or may expose your wind generator to potentially damaging turbulent conditions . time spent considering topography is vital prior to installation . barriers barriers ( buildings , trees , etc . that impede flow of wind ) produce wakes that may extend far downwind of the barrier and to a height considerably above the barrier . these wakes are areas of decreased wind speed and can cause potentially damaging turbulence . barriers near the wind generator will affect its performance . tower base & earth anchor layout remember your wind turbine tower kit should be installed by two people . tower layout the tower is assembled on the ground , then and only then , tilted into position . the tower base supports the tower on the ground , and serves as the pivot point to raise and lower the tower . two sets of guy wires ( an upper and lower set with four wires per set ) secure the tower vertically : • the upper set of guy wires secure the tower at a height of approximately 26 ft ( 8.0 m ) . • the lower set of guy wires secure the tower at a height of approximately 15 ft ( 4.6 m ) . four arrowhead earth anchors ( located approximately 15 ft ( 4.6 m ) from the tower base at 90° intervals ) secure the guy wires to the ground . one upper guy wire and one lower guy wire attach to each earth anchor . tower assembly – hillside if possible , position the tower to tilt along the incline of the hill , with the top of the tower uphill from the tower base . this will add to the stability of the tower . tower base 1. locate the area where you will install the tower . place the tower base on the ground and orientate in the direction the tower will be tilted towards . 2. have one person stand at the tower base holding a measuring tape . 3. the second person takes the measuring tape end and walks out 15 ft ( 4.6 m ) and in a circle around the tower base . • make sure there are no obstructions along the circumference .

• make sure there is sufficient room to tilt the tower into position and install the wind generator . 4. drive the four tower base earth spikes into the ground toward the center of the base , as illustrated below .

arrowhead earth anchors 1. position the first earth anchor on the ground along the tower tilt axis , 15 ft ( 4.6 m ) from the tower base . 2. place the second earth anchor along the tower tilt axis , 15 ’ ft ( 4.6m ) from the tower base in the opposite direction . • with the tower base in the center , ( 4 places ) 21.2 ft ( 6.6 m ) the first and second earth anchors should form a straight line 30 ft ( 9.2 m ) along the tower tilt axis . 3. place the third earth anchor 15 ft ( 4.6 ) from the tower base . 4. place the fourth earth anchor 15 ft ( 4.6 m ) from the tower base . • with the tower base in the center , the third and fourth earth anchors should form a line perpendicular to the line formed by the first two earth anchors 5. check the position of the earth anchors to ensure that they are within approximately 6 in ( 15 cm ) of their ideal position . • each earth anchor should be 15 ft ( 4.6 m ) from the tower base . 6. insert the beveled end of the earth anchor driving rod into the arrowhead earth anchor , as illustrated below . 7. drive the earth anchor up with force . you will notice the earth anchor pulling out of the ground into the ground using the slightly . this will lock the earth anchor in the ground . earth anchor driving rod and a 10 kg hammer .

note : no more than 12 ” inches ( 30 cm ) of earth anchor cable should be out of the ground once it has been locked into place . • notice the angle at which the earth anchor is being driven . this angle is important for maximum pull strength . the angle should be in line with the angle of the guy wire ( i.e . the angle should be pointing towards the tower base ) . important : earth anchors must be installed in soil that has been undisturbed . 8. drive the earth anchor into the ground until 6 ” inches ( 15 cm ) of cable remains above ground .

9. then , insert the earth anchor driving rod through the cable eye and pull . 10. finish installing the remaining three earth anchors as described above .

important : although the earth anchor is designed to break through small rocks , if there is a rock or obstruction that is too large , remove and relocate the anchor . the depth of the anchor is critical to its effectiveness . tower assembly the tower is assembled in several easy steps . if this is a permanent installation , first dig a trench from the base of the tower , to where the battery is housed . this will assist in the laying of wire from your turbine to battery bank . tower tube layout 1. lay out the six tower tubes on the ground as shown . leave approximately 6 ” inches ( 15 cm ) between each tube .

2. with the tubes laid out as shown on the preceding page , slide the guy wire attachment plates over the corresponding tower tubes . • slide the 30 ft ( 9.1 m ) guy wire attachment plate over the top tower tube . • slide the 21 ft ( 6.4 m ) guy wire attachment plate over the fourth tower tube from the bottom .

3. align the guy wire attachment plate so that each guy wire is in line with the anchors . 4. with all guy wire attachment plates in position , electrical wire can be run through the tower tubes . leave sufficient wire protruding at the top of the tower to connect the wind generator . • electrical wire can also be pulled through with a wire snake , after the tower tubes are assembled . 5. join the tower tubes together using a soft-faced mallet or hammer . use a piece of wood between the tube and the mallet to protect the end of the tube .

• the expanded end of the tube prevents the guy wire attachment plate from sliding down the tube , and positions the guy wire attachment plate at the correct height . 6. secure the lower tube to the tower base with the m10 bolt and nyloc nut . tighten the nut until it just contacts the tower base .

attaching the guy wires 1. orientate guy wire attachment plates with their corners pointing towards the anchor . if they are not pointing towards the anchor , adjust them before continuing . 2. uncoil each guy wire bundle and extend them to their respective anchoring point . the fourth anchor point is directly under the tower . 3. begin attaching the guy wires to the earth anchors at the sides of the tower . • insert two cable thimbles in each earth anchor eyelet . • thread an upper guy wire and lower guy wire around its own cable thimble . • loosely attach two cable clamps to each guy wire .

4. leave about 6 ” inches ( 15 cm ) of slack in the guy wires , and tighten the cable clamps . note : the guy wire to the tower should contact the ‘ saddle ’ side of the cable clamp . on level ground , there will be approximately 5 ft ( 1.5 m ) of extra cable . 5. attach two cable thimbles to the third earth anchor located directly below the tower .

6. measure the length of the upper and lower guy wires on the side earth anchors . use the same length for the guy wires on the third earth anchor . 7. secure the cable clamps to the third guy wire . 8. place two cable thimbles on the fourth earth anchor . do not connect the guy wires at this time . 9. the fourth set of guy wires are used to help tilt the tower into position . secure these guy wires only after the tower is upright . it is important to remember during installation that guy wires must not become twisted , please take time to ensure all wires are as straight as possible . raising the tower sunforce products inc. highly recommends first tilting the tower into position without the wind generator attached , to verify proper installation and operation of the tower . 1. before raising the tower , have another person ready to assist with installation . 2. one person should push the tower up into position . the other person should pull by the unattached upper guy wire . with the tower off the ground a few feet , make sure that all the wires are coming up cleanly . adjusting the guy wires if the guy wires are too tight they may cause the tower to bow as it is raised . if this happens , lower the tower to the ground and reduce the tension on the guy wires . • check to see which wire ( s ) are too tight ( the wires act in pairs ) . • release the tension on one of the wires by loosening the 2 cable clamps until the cable can be slid through them • let out some cable until there is no tension in the wire . 3. retighten the cable clamps before raising the tower . 4. once the tower is raised to vertical , attach the last guy wires to their anchor . 5. walk a short distance from the tower and look to see that it is straight . a visual check is vital throughout the installation process and can often speed up the process , by adjusting as you go . 6. focus on the angle of the tower . adjust the cables until the tower is straight up and down . use a carpenter ’ s level held against the tower for this check . 7. to adjust the angle of the tower , relax one guy wire and tighten the guy wire opposite to it . repeat this process until the tower is straight . 8. when the tower is straight , make sure that all cable clamps are tight . 9. after all the adjustments have been made , lower the tower . important : when the tower is lowered to install the wind generator , undo only the pull-side cables . when adjusting the cables , never loosen both sets of guy wires at the same time . when the tower is re-erected , only those pullside cables will need to be readjusted . installing your sunforce products wind turbine please refer to your sunforce products wind turbine manual for assembly instructions . maintenance there are no moving parts in the tower , so maintenance is minimal . however , as part of your annual maintenance , sunforce products , inc. recommends that several areas are inspected to ensure long term integrity of your wind turbine tower kit . • check guy wire condition . inspect for wear and fraying at the guy wire to earth anchor connection points . • check guy wire tension . guy wires should have uniform tension . wires should be free of slack , but not overly taut . • check all bolts for tightness . • check cable clamps and pivot bolt . • check any unusual noises or vibrations . investigate and correct as necessary .

sélection de votre emplacement l'information contenue dans la présente section offre les détails sur l'emplacement idéal pour une tour d'éolienne . s'il n'existe pas d'emplacement idéal dans votre secteur , localisez le meilleur emplacement possible . rappelez-vous qu'un emplacement adéquat accroît l'efficacité et la sécurité . de petites augmentations de la vitesse moyenne du vent résultent en des augmentations dramatiques de l'énergie de sortie de l'éolienne . par exemple , une augmentation de 10 % de la vitesse moyenne du vent [ 4 à 5 m/s ( 9 à 10 mi/h ) ] assure une augmentation d'environ 30 % de la puissance générée par le vent . donc , plus l'emplacement est bon , plus la performance est bonne . en règle générale , l'éolienne devrait être montée aussi haut et aussi loin des obstacles que possible . ceci assurera un tunnel aérodynamique libre . il existe deux exigences fondamentales pour le bon emplacement d'une éolienne : • des vents ayant une bonne vitesse moyenne ; • des vents très peu affectés par la turbulence . plus la turbulence est faible , moins votre éolienne sera soumisse aux tensions , plus elle durera et plus d'énergie elle générera . les turbulences sont créées pas les obstructions . gardez ce qui suit en tête lorsque vous êtes à la recherche d'un emplacement : • une tour directement dans le sens du vent derrière un immeuble devrait dépasser d'au moins 6,1 m ( 20 pi ) la hauteur de l'immeuble . • la tour devrait dépasser d'au moins 6,0 m ( 20 pi ) tout obstacle dans un rayon de 152,4 m ( 500 pi ) . vitesse du vent votre éolienne génère de l'énergie lorsque le vent souffle . un panneau photovoltaïque ( pv ) produit de l'énergie lorsque le soleil brille . ceci est normal selon les changements saisonniers . lorsque le soleil brille avec force , le temps est généralement calme ; lorsqu'il y a des nuages , généralement , le vent souffle .

pour que votre éolienne produise de l'énergie , la vitesse moyenne du vent à votre emplacement devrait être d'au moins 2,68 mètres/seconde ( 6 miles/heure ) . si les vents dans votre secteur ont une vitesse moyenne inférieure à 2,68 m/s ( 6 mi/h ) , vous devriez peut-être considérer la possibilité d'installer un système photovoltaïque ( pv ) près de votre éolienne , créant ainsi un système d'énergie renouvelable hybride . topographie si , au départ , votre emplacement est plat , la topographie ne cause pas de problème lors de la sélection de l'emplacement de votre éolienne . il existe des cas où l'emplacement le plus élevé disponible n'est pas nécessairement le meilleur endroit pour installer votre éolienne . l'emplacement le plus élevé environnant peut être difficile d'accès , trop éloigné de l'endroit où vous avez besoin d'électricité ou peut soumettre votre éolienne à des conditions de turbulence pouvant causer des dommages . le temps utilisé pour analyser la topographie avant l'installation est d'une importance capitale . obstacles les obstacles ( immeubles , arbres , etc . entravant le passage du vent ) produisent des sillages pouvant s'étendre sous le vent à une très grande distance de l'obstacle et à une hauteur excédant de beaucoup la hauteur de l'obstacle . ces sillages sont des secteurs où la vitesse du vent diminue et peut causer des turbulences potentiellement dangereuses . les obstacles près de l'éolienne affecteront la performance de celle-ci . configuration de la base de la tour et des ancres de terre rappelez-vous que vous devez être deux personnes pour assembler votre ensemble de tour d'éolienne . configuration de la tour la tour est d'abord assemblée au sol et puis , seulement après l'assemblage est-elle levée en position . la base de la tour supporte la tour au sol et sert de point d pivot pour élever et abaisser celle-ci . deux ensembles d'haubans ( un ensemble supérieur et un ensemble inférieur ayant quatre câbles par ensemble ) sécurisent la tour à la verticale . • • l'ensemble de haubans supérieur sécurise la tour à une hauteur d'environ 8,0 m ( 26 pi ) . l'ensemble d haubans inférieur sécurise la tour à une hauteur d'environ 4,6 m ( 15 pi ) .

quatre ancres de terre à têtes de flèche [ situées à environ 4,6 m ( 15 pi ) de la base de la tour à tous les 90 ° ] fixent les haubans au sol . un hauban supérieur et un hauban inférieur se fixent à chaque ancre de terre . assemblage de la tour – à flanc de coteau si possible , positionnez la tour pour qu'elle s'abaisse vers le haut de la colline , le haut de la tour se trouvant en amont de la base . ceci ajoutera de la stabilité à la tour . base de la tour 1 ) localisez l'emplacement où vous installerez la tour . placez la base de la tour au sol , l'orientant dans la direction vers laquelle la tour sera inclinée . 2 ) demandez à une personne de se positionner à la base de la tour en tenant un ruban à mesurer . 3 ) la seconde personne saisit alors l'extrémité du ruban à mesurer et se déplace jusqu'à 4,6 m ( 15 pi ) et marche en rond autour de la base de la tour . • assurez-vous qu'il n'existe aucune obstruction autour de la circonférence . • assurez-vous qu'il existe suffisamment d'espace pour lever la tour en position et installer l'éolienne . 4 ) enfoncez les quatre piquets de fixation de la base de la tour dans le sol les orientant vers le centre de la base tel qu'illustré ci-dessous .

ancres de terre à pointe de flèche 1. placez la première ancre de terre au sol sur l'axe d'inclinaison de la tour à 4,6 mètres ( 15 pi ) de la base . 2. placez la seconde ancre de terre au sol sur l'axe d'inclinaison de la tour à 4,6 mètres ( 15 pi ) de la base dans la direction opposée . • la base de la tour se trouvant au centre , les première et seconde ancres de terre devraient former une ligne droite de 9,2 mètre ( 30 pi ) sur l'axe d'inclinaison de la tour . 3. placez la troisième ancre de terre à 4,6 mètres ( 15 pi ) de la base de la tour . 4. placez la quatrième ancre de terre à 4,6 mètres ( 15 pi ) de la base de la tour . • la base de la tour se trouvant au centre , les troisième et quatrième ancres de terre devraient former une ligne droite perpendiculaire à la ligne formée par les deux premières ancres de terre . 5. vérifiez les positions des ancres de terre pour vous assurer qu'elles se trouvent à environ 15 cm ( 6 po ) de leurs positions idéales . • chaque ancre de terre devrait se trouver à 4,6 mètres ( 15 pi ) de la base de la tour . • la distance entre chaque ancre de terre devrait être de 6,6 m ( 21,2 pi ) . 6. insérez l'extrémité en biseau de la tige d'enfouissement d'ancre de terre dans la tête de flèche de l'ancre de terre tel qu'indiqué ci-dessous . 7. enfoncez l'ancre de terre avec force au moyen de la tige d'enfouissement d'ancre de terre et d'une masse de 10 kg ( 20 lb ) .

•

notez à quel angle l'ancre de terre est enfoncée dans le sol . cet angle est important pour assurer une force d'ancrage maximale . l'angle devrait correspondre à l'angle des haubans et s'aligner au plan joignant le point d'ancrage et la base de la tour .

important : chaque ancre de terre doit être enfouie dans un sol non dérangé . 8. enfoncez l'ancre de terre dans le sol jusqu'à ce qu'une longueur de 16 cm ( 6 po ) du câble demeure en dehors du sol .

9. puis , passez la tige d'enfouissement d'ancre de terre dans l'œil du câble et tirez légèrement . vous noterez que le câble de l'ancre de terre sortira quelque peu . cette opération bloquera l'ancre de terre dans le sol . remarque : le câble de l'ancre de terre ne devrait pas sortir du sol de plus de 30 cm ( 12 po ) lorsque l'ancre est bloquée en place . 10. complétez l'installation des autres trois ancres de terre en suivant la même procédure .

important : l'ancre de terre a été conçue pour passer à travers les petites pierres . cependant , si une pierre ou une obstruction est trop grosse , retirez et relocalisez l'ancre . la profondeur d'enfouissement de l'ancre est essentielle pour assurer son efficacité . assemblage de la tour l'assemblage de la tour comporte plusieurs étapes simples . s'il s'agit d'une installation permanente , creusez tout d'abord une tranchée allant de la base de la tour jusqu'aux installations abritant les batteries . ceci facilitera la pose des câbles allant de votre éolienne jusqu'à l'ensemble des batteries .

configuration des tuyaux de la tour 1. placez les six tuyaux de la tour au sol tel qu'indiqué . assurer un jeu d'environ 15 cm ( 6 po ) entre chaque tuyau .

2. alors que les tuyaux sont placés tel qu'indiqué à la page précédente , glissez les plaques de fixation des haubans sur les tuyaux correspondants de la tour . • glissez la plaque de fixation des haubans de 9,1 m ( 30 pi ) sur le tuyau du haut de la tour . • glissez la plaque de fixation des haubans de 6,4 m ( 21 pi ) sur le quatrième tuyau de la tour à partir du bas .

3. alignez les plaques de fixation des haubans pour que les haubans soient en ligne avec les ancres de terre . 4. lorsque les deux plaques de fixation des haubans sont en place , les câbles électriques peuvent être acheminés dans les tuyaux de la tour . laissez suffisamment de câble dépassant le haut de la tour pour permettre de brancher l'éolienne . • les câbles électriques peuvent aussi être acheminés dans les tuyaux au moyen d'un tire-fils lorsque les tuyaux de la tour sont assemblés . 5. assemblez les tuyaux de la tour en utilisant un maillet ou un marteau . utilisez un morceau de bois entre le tuyau et la massette pour protéger l'extrémité du tuyau .

l'extrémité expansé du tuyau empêche la plaque de fixation des haubans de glisser le long des tuyaux et positionne celle-ci à la bonne hauteur . 6. sécurisez le tuyau du bas de la tour à la base de la tour au moyen du boulon m10 et de l'écrou nyloc . serrez l'écrou jusqu'à ce qu'il fasse tout juste contact avec les languettes de la base de la tour . •

fixation des haubans 1. orientez les plaques de fixation des haubans pour que leurs coins pointent vers les ancres de terre . s'ils ne pointent pas dans cette direction , ajustez-les avant de procéder . 2. déroulez chaque hauban dans la direction de son point d'ancrage respectif . le quatrième point d'ancrage se situe directement en ligne avec le pied de la tour . 3. commencez par raccorder les haubans aux ancres de terre sur les côtés de la tour opposés à l'axe de pivotement de celle-ci . • insérez deux cosses de câble dans chaque œil d'ancre de terre . • enfilez un hauban supérieur et un hauban inférieur autour de sa propre cosse de câble . • installez sans trop serrer deux serre-câbles sur chaque hauban .

4. laissez un jeu d'environ 15 cm ( 6 po ) dans les haubans et serrez les serre-câbles . remarque : le hauban allant à la tour devrait entrer en contact avec le côté de la collerette du serre-câbles . sur un sol à niveau , il y aura environ 1,5 m ( 5 pi ) de câble de trop . 5. installez deux cosses de câbles à la troisième ancre de terre située directement au pied de la tour . 6. mesurez les longueurs des haubans supérieurs et inférieurs aux ancres de terre latéraux . utilisez les mêmes longueurs pour les haubans de la troisième ancre de terre . 7. sécurisez les serre-câbles des troisièmes haubans . 8. installez deux cosses de câble sur la quatrième ancre de terre . ne raccordez pas ces haubans maintenant . 9. le quatrième ensemble d'haubans sont utilisés pour ériger la tour en position . ne sécurisez ces haubans que lorsque la tour est à la verticale . il est important de se rappeler que durant l'installation il faut éviter de tordre les haubans . veuillez donc prendre le temps requis pour vous assurer que tous les haubans soient aussi droits que possible . érection de la tour sunforce products inc. recommande fortement d'ériger tout d'abord la tour en position sans l'éolienne pour s'assurer d'une installation et d'un fonctionnement adéquat de la tour . 1. avant d'ériger la tour , assurez-vous d'avoir quelqu'un pour vous aider durant l'installation . 2. une personne devrait lever la tour en position en poussant sur celle-ci . l'autre personne devrait tirer au moyen du hauban supérieur non fixé . lorsque la tour se trouve à quelques pieds du sol , assurez-vous que tous les haubans s'élèvent correctement . ajustement des haubans si les haubans sont trop serrés , ils peuvent courber la tour lors de l'érection . dans ce cas , abaissez la tour au sol et réduisez la tension des haubans . • vérifiez quels haubans sont trop serrés ( les haubans agissent en paire ) . • relâchez la tension de l'un des haubans en desserrant les deux serre-câbles jusqu'à ce que l'hauban puisse glisser . • relâchez suffisamment d'hauban pour éliminer la tension . 3. resserrez les serre-câbles avant d'ériger la tour . 4. lorsque la tour est à la verticale , fixez les derniers haubans à leur ancre de terre . 5 . éloignez-vous à une petite distance de la tour et assurez-vous qu'elle est droite et à la verticale . une vérification visuelle tout au cours du processus de l'installation est vitale et peut accélérer ce processus en effectuant des ajustements au fur et à mesure que le travail avance . 6. portez particulièrement attention à la position verticale de la tour . ajustez les haubans jusqu'à ce que la tour soit droite et verticale sur toute sa longueur . utilisez un niveau de menuisier contre la tour pour cette vérification . 7. pour ajuster la position verticale de la tour , relâchez un hauban et resserrez l'hauban opposé . répétez ce processus jusqu'à ce que la tour soit à la verticale . 8. lorsque la tour est à la verticale , assurez-vous que tous les serre-câbles soient bien serrés . 9. lorsque tous les ajustements ont été effectués , abaissez la tour .

important : lorsque la tour est abaissée pour l'installation de l'éolienne , ne défaire que les haubans sur lesquels on a tiré pour lever la tour . lors de l'ajustement des haubans , ne relâchez jamais en même temps les deux ensembles d'haubans . lorsque la tour est érigée de nouveau , seuls les haubans sur lesquels on a tiré devront être réajustés . installation de votre éolienne sunforce products veuillez référer au manuel de votre éolienne sunforce products pour les instructions d'assemblage . entretien il n'existe aucune pièce mobile dans la tour ; de ce fait , l'entretien est minimal . cependant , au cours de votre entretien annuel , sunforce products , inc. recommande que plusieurs zones soient inspectées pour assurer l'intégrité à long terme de votre ensemble de tour d'éolienne . • vérifiez l'état des haubans . inspectez les points de raccordement des haubans et des ancres de terre pour tout indice d'usure ou d'effilochage . • vérifiez la tension des haubans . les haubans devraient tous avoir une tension similaire . les haubans ne devraient être ni lâches , ni trop tendus . • vérifiez que tous les boulons soient bien serrés . • vérifiez les serre-câbles et le boulon axe de pivot . • vérifiez tous les bruits et les vibrations inusités . investiguez et corrigez au besoin .

selección del lugar para la instalación la información contenida en esta sección le proporcionará especificidades sobre el lugar ideal para la instalación de la torre . si no hay ningún lugar idóneo en su área , busque la mejor ubicación posible . recuerde que una ubicación idónea incrementa la eficiencia y la seguridad . pequeñas mejoras en velocidades medias del viento resultan en incrementos sustanciales de generación de energía del aerogenerador . por ejemplo , un incremento de la velocidad del viento del 10 % ( 9 mph - 10 mph ; 4 m/s - 4.5 m/s ) proporciona aproximadamente un incremento del 30 % de generación . por tanto , cuanto mejor sea la ubicación , mejor será el rendimiento . como regla general , el aerogenerador debería instalarse tan alto y tan lejos como sea posible de cualquier tipo de obstáculo . esto creará un área de viento despejado . dos requerimientos básicos para un buen lugar para el aerogenerador : • buen promedio de velocidad de viento anual • bajas turbulencias cuanto más baja sean las turbulencias , el aerogenerador soportará menor estrés , mayor será su durabilidad , y producirá mayor cantidad de energía . las turbulencias están creadas por los obstáculos .

mantenga en mente los siguientes detalles cuando esté decidiendo la ubicación para la instalación : : • una torre instalada en un edificio , debería estar como mínimo 6 m por encima del edificio • la torre debería colocarse 6 m por encima de cualquier barrera en un radio de 150 m velocidad del viento su aerogenerador producirá energía cuando haya viento . un panel solar fotovoltaico ( pv ) producirá energía cuando brille el sol . esto es típico en cambios de estación . cuando el tiempo es soleado , normalmente el viento está en calma ; cuando está nublado , el tiempo es normalmente ventoso . para que su aerogenerador produzca energía , la velocidad media del viento en su ubicación debe ser al menos de 2,68 m/s ( 6 mph ) si el viento en su zona es menor de 2,68 m/s , debería plantearse instalar módulos fotovoltaicos ( pv ) para crear un sistema de energías renovables híbrido topografía si su ubicación es plana , la topografía no supone ningún problema a la hora de decidir dónde colocar el aerogenerador . se dan circunstancias donde la zona de tierra más alta disponible no sea el mejor lugar . la zona de tierra más alta puede ser de difícil acceso , puede que esté muy lejos de donde necesite la energía , o puede que el lugar exponga al aerogenerador a condiciones turbulentas potencialmente peligrosas . el tiempo previo invertido en considerar la topografía para la instalación es vital . barreras las barreras ( edificios , árboles , etc . que impidan el flujo del viento ) producen estelas que pueden extenderse muy por debajo de la zona de afectación de las mismas , y también por encima de las mismas . estas zonas afectadas por las estelas son zonas de menor velocidad de viento y donde se pueden producir turbulencias potencialmente peligrosas . las barreras cerca del aerogenerador afectarán a su resultado . diseño de la base de la torre & anclaje a tierra recuerde que el kit de la torre debería ser instalado por al menos 2 personas.. diseño de la tower la torre se monta en el suelo , y solo entonces se podrá poner en su posición correcta . la base de la torre soporta la torre en el suelo , y sirve como el punto pivote para bajar y subir la torre . dos grupos de vientos ( uno superior y otro inferior con 4 cables por grupo ) asegurarán la torre verticalmente : • el grupo superior de vientos asegura la torre a una altura aproximada de 8.0 m. • el grupo inferior de vientos asegura la torre a una altura aproximada de 4.6 m. cuatro anclajes a la tierra con forma de flecha ( ubicadas aproximadamente a 4.6 m desde la base de la torre , a intervalos de 90° ) aseguran los vientos al suelo . un viento superior y otro inferior se sujetan a cada anclaje a la tierra . montaje de la torre – en ladera si posible , colocar la torre para poder inclinarla fácilmente sobre el terreno . base de la torre 1. decida el lugar donde va a instalar la torre . coloque la base de la torre en el suelo y oriéntela en la dirección hacia dónde va a inclinar la torre . 2. una persona debe colocarse en la base de la torre con una cinta métrica . 3. la segunda persona deberá coger la cinta métrica y caminar 4.6 m en círculo alrededor de la base de la torre . • asegúrese que no hay obstrucciones a lo largo de la circunferencia . • asegúrese que hay suficiente espacio para inclinar la torre e instalar el aerogenerador . 4. clave las 4 puntas de sujeción a la tierra de la base en la tierra hacia el centro de la base , según se muestra más abajo

anclajes a la tierra 1. coloque el primer anclaje en el suelo a lo largo del eje de inclinación de la torre , a 4.6 m de la base de la torre . 2. coloque el segundo anclaje a lo largo del eje de inclinación de la torre , a 4.6 m de la base de la torre , en dirección opuesta . • con la base de la torre en el centro , el primer y el segundo anclaje deberían formar una línea recta de 9.2 m a lo largo del eje de inclinación de la torre . 3. coloque el tercer anclaje a 4.6 m de la base de la torre . 4. coloque el cuarto anclaje a 4.6 m de la base de la torre • con la base de la torre en el centro , el tercer y cuarto anclajes deberían formar una línea perpendicular a la línea formada por el primer y segundo anclajes . 5. compruebe la posición de los anclajes para asegurar que no están a más de 15 cm de su posición ideal . • cada anclaje a la tierra debería estar a 4.6 m. de la base de la torre . 6. introducir una barra en cada anclaje . ver foto . 7. tire de los anclajes con fuerza hasta que se fijen bien al suelo .

nota : no debería quedar más de 30 cm de cable fuera del suelo una vez fijado definitivamente en su lugar . • fíjese en el ángulo en el que se está clavando el anclaje . este ángulo es importante para obtener una fuera de amarre máxima . el ángulo debería estar en línea con el ángulo del viento ( e.g . el ángulo debería estar apuntando hacia la base de la torre ) . importante : cada anclaje a tierra debe instalarse en suelo que no haya sido alterado . 8. clave el anclaje en la tierra hasta que quede 15 cm de cable sobre el suelo .

9. después , inserte el cable por lo orificios de la flecha y tire . 10. finalice instalando los 3 anclajes según se ha descrito arriba .

importante : a pesar de que el anclaje a tierra está diseñado para perforar pequeñas piedras , si hay una roca u obstrucción grande , coloque el anclaje en otro lugar . la profundidad del anclaje es crítica para conseguir su efectividad . montaje de la torre la torre se monta en varios pasos sencillos . si se trata de una instalación permanente , primero cave una zanja desde la base de la torre hasta donde vaya a colocar la batería . esto ayudará a facilitar la instalación del cableado de su aerogenerador al banco de baterías . diseño de los tubos de la torre 1. coloque los 6 tubos de la torre en el suelo según se muestra . deje aproximadamente 15 cm entre cada tubo .

2. con los tubos colocados según se ha explicado , deslice las places de los vientos en los tubos correspondientes . • deslice la placa del viento de 9.1 m sobre el tubo superior . • deslice la placa del viento de 6.4 m sobre el cuarto tubo contado desde abajo

3. alinee la placa del viento de modo que cada viento esté alineado con los anclajes . 4. con todas las placas de los vientos en posición , se puede insertar el cable eléctrico a través de los tubos inferiores . deje suficiente cable saliendo de la parte superior de la torre para conectar el aerogenerador . • también se puede tirar del cable eléctrico con un tira-hilos , después de que los tubos de la torre estén montados . 5. junte los tubos de la torre utilizando un mazo con goma para proteger el extremo del tubo .

• el extremo expandido del tubo previene que las placas de amare de los vientos se deslicen en el tubo hacia abajo , y coloca la placa de amarre de los vientos en su altura correcta . 6. asegure el tubo inferior a la base con el tornillo m10 y la tuerca . apriete la tuerca hasta que haga contacto con la base de la torre .

fijando los vientos 1. oriente las placas de amarre de los vientos con sus esquinas apuntando hacia el anclaje . si no están apuntando hacia el anclaje , ajústelas antes de continuar . 2. desenrosque cada grupo de vientos y extiéndalos a los puntos de anclaje respectivos . el cuarto punto de anclaje está directamente bajo la torre . 3. comience amarrando los vientos de anclaje que están a los lados de la torre .

4. deje alrededor de 15 cm de cable flojo en los vientos , y apriete las abrazaderas del cable nota : debe de sobrar cerca de 1.5 m de cable extra . 5. enganchar dos vientos con el de tierra justo a pie de la toree 6. medir la longitud de los vientos alto y bajo . usar esa misma longitud para la tercera sujeción a tierra . 7. asegurar el tercer viento . 8. enganchar los dos cables del cuarto cable a tierra . no conectar los vientos en este momento . 9. el cuarto conjunto de vientos serán necesarios para levantar la torre a su posición definitiva . asegurar estos vientos solo cuando la torre este en su posición definitiva .

es muy importante asegurar durante la instalación que todos los vientos estén libre , sin enredarse , por favro tome su tiempo en asegurar que todos los vientos estén siempre lo más estirados posibles . levantar la torre le recomendamos especialmente que la primera vez que instale la torre lo haga sin el aerogenerador , para verificar que todo es correcto y no habrá ningún problema posterior . 1. antes de elevar la torre , es necesario que otra persona le ayude en la instalación . 2. una persona podrá levantar la torre a su posición y la otra podrá fijar el último viento . mientras levante la torre fíjese que todos los vientos están correctos y que no hay nada enredado . ajustando los vientos si los vientos están excesivamente ajustados , podría dificultar la elevación de la torre . si ocurre esto , baje la torre y reduzca la tensión de los vientos . • chequee que vientos están demasiado tensos ( recuerde que los vientos actúan por pares • reduzca la tensión de los vientos soltando un poco el clip de fijación hasta que deslicen un poco los cables . • saca un poco de cable hasta que la tensión desaparezca . 3. reajuste los clips de fijación antes de elevar de nuevo la torre . 4. una vez la torre este elevada en vertical , sujetar el ultimo viento en la tierra correspondiente . 5. verificar visualmente si la torre esta recta . hágalo a cierta distancia , unos metros . este chequeo visual es importante para evitar posteriores trabajos . 6. ajustar los cables hasta que la torre quede totalmente recta . usar un nivel para asegura la verticalidad . 7. para ajustar el ángulo de la torre , aflojar un lado del viento y ajustar el cable contrario . repetir esta operación hasta que la torre este recta . 8. cuando la torre este recta , asegurarse de que todos los cables están ajustados . 9. después de todos estos ajustes , bajar la torre . importante : cunod la torre este bajada para instalar el aerogenerador , suelte solo los cables que vaya a tirar posteriormente . nunca suelte ambos lados a la vez . cuando la torre sea levantada de nuevo , solo será necesario tirar de estos cables . . instalar el aerogenerador sunforce por favor , lea el manual de instalación del aerogenerador mantenimiento no hay partes móviles en la torre , por lo que el mantenimiento es mínimo . sin embargo , como parte de su mantenimiento anual , le recomendamos que se inspeccionen varias áreas con el fin de asegurar larga vida e integridad de su torre • compruebe la condición de los vientos . inspeccione detenidamente los vientos t y la union a los cables de tierra . • compruebe la tensión de los vientos . los vientos deberían tener tensión uniforme . los vientos deberían estar suficientemente tensados pero no demasiado tirantes . • compruebe que todos los tornillos están debidamente fijados y apretados . • chequee los clips de fijación y las tuercas . • compruebe cualquier ruido extraño o cualquier vibración no habitual . investigue y corríjalo si necesario .

bwea wind turbine safety rules
the wind turbine safety rules ( wtsr ) clearly specify actions and procedures which have to be followed in order that persons working on wind turbines are safeguarded from inherent dangers that exist from the installed electrical and mechanical equipment in wind turbines . they have been developed jointly by owners and manufacturers of wind turbines . they have been in use since 2005 and are endorsed by the bwea as representing industry best practice for operational wind farms . the wtsr provide a single way of managing operational safety , giving owners and wind turbine maintenance service providers a consistent and auditable process across their uk portfolios . they are a fine example of how key members of bwea have been working together for the good of the industry and represent a world leading approach to managing operational safety in wind turbines . a wind farm consists of two distinct systems : the high voltage ( hv ) infrastructure and the wind turbines with their associated low voltage ( lv ) infrastructure . the wtsr apply only to the wind turbine and associated lv infrastructure . to carry out work on equipment in a wind turbine , the wtsr require approved written procedures ( awp ’ s ) to be put in place for each work package significant enough to warrant it . an awp is a procedure which specifies how work on plant & apparatus below 1000v ac or 1500v dc , will be carried out safely – it is similar to a method statement and it includes checkpoint signatures as auditable proof that safety precautions were applied for the duration of the work . the wtsr ’ s also give guidance on when awp ’ s are required ; and when they are not necessary . the wtsr are currently implemented in the uk at over 100 wind farms . major industry players advocate their use . the bwea supports a wtsr review group whose remit is to review their use and recommend improvements based on operating experience . the wtsr were updated in june 2009 to incorporate changes suggested by the group . an implementation support package consisting of the wtsr , support and guidance documents are available on the bwea website to assist members to introduce the wtsr into their companies - online at www.bwea.com/safety/safety_rules .

abstract
an initial analysis was performed for areas suitable for offshore wind farm development near the california coast . based on the analysis , california 's offshore wind resource was divided up into three areas ; northern california , san francisco bay area , and southern california . the siting of an offshore wind farm is limited by water depth , with shallow water being the most preferable economically . acceptable depths for offshore wind farms were broken up into three categories , based on current and future wind turbine tower support technology ; < =20 meters depth for monopile towers , < =50 meters for water jacket tripods/quadrapods , and < = 200 meters depth for deep water floating tower technology which is likely to be developed in the next 15 years . using the penn state/national center for atmospheric research mesoscale model version 5 ( mm5 ) to predict winds aloft at high resolution ( 1.67 and 5 km ) near the locations of interest , annual 80 meter wind speeds were found for each area . annual 80 meter wind speeds were based on the average of january , april , july , and octobers ' 2005 mm5 model data . using the repower 5m 5.0 mw , 126 meter diameter offshore wind turbine , a preliminary overall resource assessment was made for coastal california . initial estimates show that 2-10 twh , 9-27 twh , and 67-293 twh of energy could be harnessed annually using monopile , state of the art , and future turbine support technology in northern california , the bay area , and southern california respectively .

introduction
offshore wind resource estimates have been performed for some parts of the us , including the mid atlantic bight [ kempton et al . , 2007 ] , georgia [ elliott and schwartz , 2006 ] , and lake michigan [ owen , robert h. , jr. , 2004 ] . as far as the authors know , only one california offshore wind resource estimate was performed to date [ musial and butterfield , 2004 ] . this estimate , which relied on 50 m height mesoscale weather model predictions that the authors state had not been validated with actual wind data , found that significant resource potential

existed off the coast of california in mostly deep waters . this resource assessment broke up usable areas by depth ( 0 to 30 m depth and “ deep ” ) and distance from the shore ( 5-20 nautical miles and 20-50 nautical miles ) . this methodology excluded significant shallow water areas , with good wind resource , close to the shore . further , the study was based on a 50 m turbine hub height ; a height at which modern wind turbines are no longer built . several studies have looked at winds off the california coast [ haack , et al . , 2005 ; archer , et al . , 2005a ] but not for the purpose of wind energy assessment . an overall global wind energy study that scaled buoy data off the california coast to the 80 m height found good offshore wind resource does exist at some of the buoy sites [ archer , et al . , 2005b ] . this study analyzed the california offshore wind energy potential at the modern1 hub height of 80 m. taller turbine hubs take advantage of higher wind speeds aloft due to reduced surface friction and hence , produce more power given the same wind resource . the format of this resource assessment study , was loosely based on a offshore wind resource assessment methodology from the university of delaware [ dhanju et al . , 2007 ] . in this study , we calculate the usable surface area of three different depth classes ( 20 , 50 , and 200 m max depth ) off coastal california , calculate the average wind speeds at these locations , and finally calculate the total power and annual energy outputs . in order to come up with useful energy calculations , it was necessary to pick a specific turbine model . the repower 5m 5.0 mw turbine [ repower sytems ag , 2007 ] with a 126.0 m rotor diameter was chosen for this study . although the hub height for the offshore repower 5m , is 90-100 m , this study used the more conservative 80 m height . you could expect to find approximately 7.6 % more wind power at the 100 m height , based on traditional coefficients used for the power law2 . in order to estimate winds offshore , where little in-situ data exists , the penn . state/national center for atmospheric research mesoscale model version 5 ( mm5 ) weather model was run at 5 km and 1.67 km resolution over the entire state of california and san francisco bay area respectively . mm5 was run for the months of january , april , july , and november 2005 to approximate seasonal and an annual average for the california offshore wind resource . using these 80 m wind speeds , in conjunction with the bathymetry suitable for offshore turbine development near the coast , a power and energy total of the california resource was calculated .

modeling the california offshore wind resource
the penn state university/ncar mesoscale model version 5 ( mm5 ) was used to model the winds offshore california at high resolution . one parent domain at 5 km horizontal resolution was created over the entire on and offshore regions of interest in california . a 1.67 km horizontal resolution , 1-way nested-domain was
1 it should be noted that the some turbines have higher turbine heights than 80 m. the enercon e-112 ( 4.5 – 6.0 mw ) has a hub height of 124 m [ enercon , 2005 ] . the vestas v90 3.0 mw has a hub height between 80 - 105 m [ vestas , 2007 ] . 2 for example , using the wind profile power law with =0.11 , yields a 2.5 % increase over the 80 m to 100 m wind speed ; a 7.6 % increase in power

created over the san francisco bay area . figure 1 shows the domain configuration for mm5 . in order to more accurately resolve the winds at the 80 m height , two additional horizontal layers ( sigma-levels ) were added to the mm5 model directly above and below the 80 m offshore height , with a total vertical resolution of 28-levels ( ptop=100 hpa ) . a linear interpolation was used post process to calculate the 80 m wind speed . the 10 m wind speed was also calculated , for future validation studies that will utilize offshore buoy wind data ( typically at the 5-10 m height ) . all of the wind data was inserted into a large , geospatial database that allows geospatial querying of the wind data overlain with the bathymetry data . figure 2 shows the modeled average 80 m wind speed for the months of january , april , july , and october 2005. the mm5 model ran , using 8processors on a gnu/linux cluster , using all of the default mm5 physics options . the national center for 1.67 km environmental prediction 1 degree by 1 resolution degree global final ( fnl ) analyses was used to create initial and boundary conditions for mm5 [ national center for environmental prediction , 2007. boundary conditions were updated every 6 hours . the model was figure 1 : mother and nested 1-way restarted every 7 days and reinitialized domain at 5 and 1.67 km respectively with the fnl data . an additional 6 used for modeling the 80 m offshore hours was added to each model run to wind resource . the 80 m wind fields allow the model to spin-up before wind were derived by increasing the vertical fields were used . this extra 6 hours resolution of mm5 around the 80 m was thrown out and not used in the height . calculation of the wind resource . using these four months of modeled data with hourly output , a projected annual average wind speed at each offshore location was predicted . a temporal analysis of wind speeds for a specific site ( off of cape mendocino ) using the average hourly output was also performed using this data . although we have not fully validated this mm5 output against in-situ buoy and radiosounde data , initial comparisons of mm5 winds and buoy wind data have looked promising . future work will provide a complete validation of the mm5 modeled wind data .

turbine tower support technologies
an added constraint of offshore wind turbines is the depth at which turbine support towers can be placed , as well as the extra cost associated with each

80 m wind speed ( m/s )

figure 2 : modeled 80 m wind resource , based on the four month mm5 model runs ( january , april , july , and october 2005 ) . only wind resource from 0-200 m depth is shown on this map and only wind resource greater than 7.0 m/s and 7.5 m/s were included in this study . pink areas over land are urban centers , where most of the offshore wind energy could be used .

tower technology . the economics of minimizing the amount of underwater transmission cable laid and maintenance requirements of offshore wind turbines lend themselves to much larger turbines than their onshore counterparts . further , offshore wind turbines are not limited by the maximum shipping sizes of trucks , trains , and roadways like their onshore counterparts . to estimate the wind resource potential based on depth , the bathymetry data was classified by each type of turbine support technology . california generally has much deeper water offshore than other locations where resource assessments have been performed . in extremely shallow water ( up to 5 meters depth ) , gravity base structures have been used . for this study , we have neglected the gravity base structures , due to their limited utility with california 's deeper water . monopile turbine tower support structures structures can be placed in waters up to 20 meters depth ( oldest and cheapest technology ) [ henderson et al . , 2003 ] and new water jacket tripods/quadrapods can be placed in waters up to 50 m depth [ talisman energy , 2006 ] . in the proposed beatrice offshore wind farm 22 km ( 12 mi ) off the coast of scotland , monopile : water jacket floating : support towers will be 0-20 m tripod : 50m-200m located at 45 meters 20m-50m ( future ) depth . two different water depth figure 3 : examples of the three different classes of jacket tripod support turbine support structures . image 1 & 2 source : designs will use either [ owe , 2007 ] . image 3 source : [ nrel , 2007 ] driven steel piles or suction piles to hold the towers to the sea bed [ henderson et al . , 2003 ] . a water jacket structure was installed in the summer of 2006 in 44 m depth water at the beatrice wind farm demonstrator project , off the coast of scotland [ rea , 2007 ] . lastly , it is likely that floating turbine structures , similar to oil and gas platforms today will be developed in the next 15 years , capable of depths of up to 200 m [ mit , 2006 ] . these depths are used as technology constraints throughout the study and coincide with the depths used in the offshore wind assessment methodology [ dhanju et al . , 2007 ] , with the exception of deep water being considered 50-200 m depth ( instead of 50-100 m depth ) . figure 3 illustrates three examples of these different classes of turbine support technologies .

calculation of offshore areas suitable for turbines
in order to determine the amount of usable area off the california coast suitable for offshore wind turbines , a base layer of bathymetry ( underwater depth ) was used and divided into tower technology classes ( 20 , 50 , and 200 m max depth ) . the national geophysical data center ( ngdc ) 3-arc second coastal relief model [ noaa and ngdc , 2000 ] provided approximately 30 m horizontal resolution3 over the california domain . this bathymetry data was of significantly higher resolution than used in the previous offshore wind resource assessment of california , which used a 1 km resolution dataset [ musial and butterfield , 2004 ] . where wind speeds had an annual average of 7.0 and 7.5 m/s or higher , they were included as usable water area where offshore wind could be developed . the 7.5 m/s cutoff was chosen to coincide with the nrel class 5 resource , with a standard power density of 500 w/m2 [ elliott et al . , 1987 ] . the 7.0 m/s cutoff was chosen to include the future possibility of an offshore wind turbine that could utilize lower wind speeds . the geospatial intersection of the ngdc bathymetry data and the annual modeled wind resource greater than 7.0 m/s and 7.5 m/s is the basis for the surface areas in table 1 below .

table 1 : usable amount of offshore surface area suitable for wind turbine development contained within each depth region . only areas that had wind speeds higher than 7.0 m/s and 7.5 m/s were included in this study .

ocean depth 0-20 m 20 – 50 m 50 – 200 m

in order to simplify the offshore wind resource assessment , the average wind speeds were grouped by ocean depth and cutoff wind speed , shown in table 2. these average annual 80 m wind speeds were used in the calculation of the turbine capacity factor and nameplate capacity , which in turn will yielded an annual energy output .

3 the central latitude of california is 37.25° . at this latitude , 3-arc seconds is 8.333e-4 degrees . the earth 's circumference is 40,080 m at the equator and 16,600 around the center of california . leading longitudinal resolution of 14 m and a latitudinal resolution of 33 m for the usgs 3-arc second bathymetry data .

estimate of wind power and energy offshore
in order to determine how much surface area would be required for each turbine , a 4-diameter by 7-diameter spacing [ masters , 2004 ] was chosen between turbines , where the turbine diameter is 126 m. each repower 5m turbine would require 0.44 km2 of area per turbine . in order to account for the surface area that would potentially be unusable due to shipping lanes , restricted wildlife preservation areas , viewshed considerations , etc ... , a 33 % exclusionary factor for all possible turbine areas was included in each nameplate capacity and energy calculation . future studies should look at the details of each area 's exclusion zones , in order to more precisely calculate amount of usable surface area . table 3 shows the nameplate capacity of each geographical region and depth class . table 3 : nameplate capacity of turbines ( mw ) in each geographical area , depth , and wind speed cutoff , assuming a 33 % exclusionary factor for each area .

to make an initial estimate of the energy that could be achieved from offshore wind turbines , the repower 5m , 5 mw wind turbine with a 126 diameter at 80 m height was chosen . the capacity factor for the proposed wind farms was

estimated using equation 1 which states the relationship between mean wind speed ( vavg ) , rated power ( prated ) and rotor diameter ( d ) [ masters , 2004 ] . given this equation , the capacity factor based on the overall average wind speed for each turbine tower technology was calculated . prated kw  d m

a significant amount of offshore wind energy potential does exist in california , with 78-330 twh developable annually in all waters . while the vast majority of the california offshore wind resource exists in deep waters ( 86-98 % ) , a significant amount of energy relative to california 's overall electric generation capacity . each of the three geographical regions are analyzed in more depth , including access to existing transmission lines in the following section .

geographical context of the offshore wind resource
although more expensive to build , offshore wind turbines can often provide clean energy closer to california 's coastal population centers , where most of population resides . in order to provide geographical context for the california offshore wind resource , we mapped the water depth [ noaa/ngdc , 2000 ] , urban areas [ usgs , 2001 ] , and existing transmission lines [ fema , 1993 ] together in figures 4 , 5 , and 6 for each california geographical region . figure 2 can be consulted to find the average modeled 80 m wind resource . we combined the modeled wind resource , annual energy output estimate ( table 4 ) , and the transmission/depth maps to come up with the feasibility of developing offshore wind in each of the three geographical locations . northern california ( figure 4 ) could potentially provide 11 twh of wind energy annually in relatively shallow water ( 0-50 m ) , using existing turbine and tower

support technology.4 this amount of energy alone could offset 6.3 % of california 's current carbon emitting electricity sources.5 further , if deep water turbine support technology is developed , 27 % of california 's current carbon electricity sources could be replaced by offshore wind energy in northern california alone.4 the initial assessment for the bay area ( figure 5 ) looked less viable for near term development . the good 80 m wind resource seems to occur far from the city of san francisco and exists primarily in deep waters ( 50-200 m ) , with almost zero good wind resource in the bay itself ( see table 1 for details ) . most of the large transmission lines would need to be accessed through the san francisco bay outlet , as little coastal transmission access exists . one potentially interesting location in the bay area is the farallon islands ( managed by the city of san francisco ) , which appear to have the necessary wind resource ( > 7.5 m/s ) and are surrounded by fairly shallow water ( < 50 m depth ) . however , the length of undersea transmission cable required may be cost prohibitive , as the islands are about 43 km ( 27 miles ) offshore . further , the islands ' unique bird nesting , marine mammal , and fish populations would need careful review before turbines could be sited in this location . a positive attribute of the islands ' far distance from shore is that it would make the offshore wind turbines nearly impossible to see from san francisco and might quell any viewshed concerns from city residents . based our initial assessment , southern california ( figure 6 ) appears to have little easily developable offshore wind resource . it should be noted that some of the offshore sites analyzed had good wind resource for three of the four 2005 months modeled , but had significantly reduced winds in the july 2005 month . while the pacific high pressure system located off the southern california coast during the summer may suppress some of the winds , more modeling and validation needs to be performed . it should be noted that the southern california coast does however provide several excellent grid interconnection points . further , existing oil and gas platforms in southern california may reduce public opposition to the siting of wind farms .

4 using the more realistic cutoff of 7.5 m/s , 80 m wind speed . 5 carbon emitting electric generation ( coal , natural gas , and biomass ) was a total of 174.746 twh in 2006 including in and out of state sources [ cec , 2007 ] .

figure 4 : bathymetry , urban areas , and transmission lines for northern california . the best california offshore wind resource exists in northern california but the region lacks any large population centers and any large transmission lines near the coast . development in this region is still plausible , using the existing 115 kv transmission lines that run through eureka . see the section titled “ temporal analysis of wind ” for details .

figure 5 : bathymetry , urban areas , and transmission lines for the san francisco bay area . ( see figure 4 for legend . ) although a reasonable amount of shallow water exists near the bay , wind speeds look to be marginal until the deeper water is reached .

figure 6 : bathymetry , urban areas , and transmission lines for southern california . ( see figure 4 for legend . ) this study found good wind resource for three of the four months modeled ( january , april , and october 2005 ) , but reduced wind resource throughout much of southern california during the summer month modeled ( july 2005 ) . the reduced summer wind is likely due to the position of the large high pressure system ( pacific high ) that sits over the region in the summer months .

comparison of results to other estimates
musial and butterfield of the national renewable energy laboratory ( nrel ) in their 2004 estimate found that for shallow depths ( < 30 m ) and deep water ( > 30 m ) , 2,650 mw and 295,550 mw of developable wind power existed off the coast of california respectively , between 5 and 50 nautical miles ( 9.3 km to 93 km ) from shore . the study was based on the nrel 50 m wind resource data , which they state has not been validated for offshore conditions . the nrel study also used different exclusionary percentages ; a conservative 67 % for the 5-20 nm ( 9 km – 37 km ) zone and 33 % for the 20 – 50 nm ( 37 km – 93 km ) zone . the study also excluded 100 % of the 0-5 nm ( 0-9 km ) zone near shore . the nrel study also did not use a cutoff wind speed , as this study did . for comparative purposes , this study found ( table 3 ) 3,369 mw of capacity ( with a 7.0 m/s cutoff ) in the 0-20 m depth range ( approximately the 0-30 m range used in the nrel study ) and 115,423 mw of capacity in the 20 m-200 m depth range ( approximately the “ deep ” range for the nrel study ) . the nrel study did not include an energy output approximation , so it 's not possible to compare the overall energy output of the offshore wind potential unfortunately . further , the nrel study was done at the 50 m turbine height , compared to the 80 m turbine height of this study . though the methodology and assumptions differed significantly , both this study and the nrel study concluded similar orders of approximation for the capacity ( within 27 % for the shallow water and within 156 % for the deep water ) .

temporal analysis of offshore wind
the time of day when wind power peaks is important because the summer peak electric demand occurs late in the afternoon , around 5:00 pm [ price , h. and cable , r. , 2001 ] . in order to analyze how offshore wind energy might fit into california 's electric grid , a sample wind park in northern ca was created . figure 7 shows one example park , located in some of the best offshore wind in california . the 80 m wind resource we modeled for this proposed wind park is extremely steady throughout most hours of the day and only slows from about 9 m/s to 7 m/s late in the afternoon during the july 2005 modeled month ; still an excellent wind resource overall . using equation 1 , with the modeled annual average 80 m wind speed of 8.1 m/s , we find a 39 % capacity factor for this wind park . using the same methodology to calculate turbine nameplate capacity and annual energy output , this project alone could produce 9.7 twh annually , with a 2,385 mw nameplate capacity . this wind park alone could replace 5.6 % of california 's current carbon emitting electric generation.5

conclusions
despite the steep bathymetry off the california coast , significant development potential exists for offshore wind . by looking at the depth of the water more closely , with a higher resolution bathymetry dataset , it was possible to find some areas that were overlooked for offshore wind power development in a previous study . this study also qualitatively looked at transmission capacity and population centers to build a context for the offshore wind resource in california . we found that northern california had the best 80 m wind resource but has the least transmission capacity . some of northern california 's resource could be developed today , using existing turbine support technology . the san francisco bay area however , will more than likely require the development of floating turbine support structures for large scale offshore turbine development . southern california 's wind resource is significantly reduced during the summer months , due to the location of the pacific high . more in-depth modeling and validation needs to be undertaken to learn exactly what times of the year and in what locations the wind resource subsides in southern california . in sum total , based on the 80 m wind speed cutoffs of 7.0 m/s and 7.5 m/s , between 26 % and 112 % respectively of california 's electricity needs could be

provided with offshore wind energy alone [ cec , 2007 ] .

analysis of diffuser augmented wind turbines analysis of diffuser augmented wind turbines michael moeller jr. , and dr. kenneth visser† department of mechanical and aeronautical engineering abstract many different methods of alternative energy are being evaluated in order to address the current crisis arising from the depletion of non-renewable resources . wind energy represents a viable alternative , as it is a virtually endless resource . one of the more promising concepts in the wind energy field is the development of the diffuser augmented wind turbine ( dawt ) . these configurations use an additional diffuser to improve performance . the dawt geometry concept has been analyzed using clarkson ’ s mrotor code with a focus on the wind tamer dawt of future energy solutions inc of livonia , ny . preliminary calculations based on optimizing the original wind tamer geometries , indicate power coefficients peaking at cp = 0.39 , using commercial sizing . an optimization analysis in mrotor has indicated that power coefficients of nearly cp = 0.5 for lower wind speeds , and even higher at faster wind speeds , can be achieved with minor design modifications . full scale testing of this concept is underway at the clarkson wind turbine test site and will continue for several months . i. introduction/ background information it is becoming necessary to fully understand how to improve wind turbine efficiency , as energy consumption and cost reaches record-breaking levels . the cost of oil and non-renewable resources is skyrocketing , and the depletion of these resources will require a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source . an improvement to wind turbine efficiency will allow the limits of today to be surpassed , and someday be able to extract all of the energy from the wind with only a few improvements in technology . a greater number of these high-efficiency turbines would lower the cost of energy , powering the world for less . one such method of improving turbine efficiency is a diffuser augmented wind turbine ( dawt ) as an improvement to the conventional horizontal axis wind turbine ( hawt ) . dawts are simply a hawt with a trumpet-bell-shaped diffuser surrounding the rotor blades and extending aft . a dawt is claimed to have a greater efficiency than conventional hawts , even possibly higher than the betz limit , because the diffuser allows for a greater pressure drop across the rotor blade . only one dawt has been commercially produced , the vortec 7 as seen in figure 1. dawts offer additional advantages in addition to increased augmentation , including minimal tip speed losses ; a small rotor diameter that increases rpm , and being less yaw sensitive than hawts . however , there are many issues with dawts that need to be addressed to fully understand them before their greatest power output can be achieved . one of the most current dawts it the wind tamer dawt created by jerry brock of future energy solutions inc. of lavonia , ny . this dawt incorporates data from past researchers , and also includes a newly innovative bypass region . figure 1 : the vortec 7 diffuser augmented wind turbine . 3 ii . methodology when designing a turbine for any given location , several parameters need to be determined for optimal or near optimal performance . mrotor is a matlab code developed at clarkson university k. visser , m. brown , and m. duquette , which uses blade element method ( bem ) to calculate some of these parameters to analyze wind turbines . based on earlier preliminary tests performed by engineers from rochester , ny , it was apparent that the wind tamer was not optimized to run at low wind speeds . since the average wind speed in potsdam , ny is around 4 m/s ( a lower wind speed ) , the wind tamer performance may not be optimally efficient . using the current geometry and running several tests in mrotor , this was confirmed to be the case ; so several optimization tests were run to suggest design modifications to maximize efficiency . these tests were categorized by performance augmentation , though the associated cost with these designs could potentially harm the cost to power to cost ratio of the wind tamer . full scale testing of the wind tamer concept is in progress at the clarkson wind turbine test site and will continue for several months . data from testing will be compared to the theoretical calculations . iii . results and discussion from the bem data , it appears that 12 blades on the wind tamer would prove to be more beneficial . it is also apparent that if the pitch and twist distribution were to be varied from the original design , augmentation would increase further . another issue addressed in the tables was changing of the blade profile to be an airfoil rather than flat plates . flat plates will reduce the efficiency of the wind tamer in field-testing ; due to the increased drag flat plates have over airfoils . if a cambered airfoil or a symmetric airfoil were used , the aerodynamic efficiency could benefit greatly . since bem seems to underestimate actual performance , it is recommended that the design modifications occur that do not attach much additional cost to the wind tamer . figure 2 : power outputs vs. blade number for various blade design modifications to the wind tamer dawt . figure 2 illustrates a few changes to the design that will increase the output power at a higher wind speed , nearly doubling the original power output . also , since the bem calculation is limited to a free stream rotor , it is expected that the power augmentation would increase even further , by a factor of approximately 1.28 based on averages taken from comparisons with preliminary data . if all of the changes are made as suggested , it can be expected that the power output can increase from 150 watts to 286.98 watts , an augmentation of 1.921 for the 18 m/s wind regime . using mrotor , the cp values expected would be around 0.36 for the various optimized airfoils at 13.4 m/s . however , this value is associated with the bem calculation , and not the expected power output . therefore , it is expected that the power coefficient of the wind tamer dawt at 13.4 m/s will be 0.46. in addition , power coefficients appear to be increasing as rotor diameter increases , which may augment the power output ever further . based on past research by grumman aerospace and many others , the optimal exit area ratio for a diffuser augmented wind turbine is stated to be 2.78 to 1 for economic reasons . also a length to diameter ratio has been economically optimized to be 0.715 to 1 for a dawt , and a diffuser angle of 30 degrees . these design changes could positively affect the performance of the wind tamer dawt to be close to , or beat the betz limit , by a significant margin.1,6 iv . concluding remarks from the mrotor analysis , it is suggested that the wind tamer dawt be adjusted slightly , though theoretical calculations do not always reflect real-world tests . with these minor changes , performance could be potentially increased to near or greater than 2 times current power output . it was determined that further power augmentation was possible , but no calculations have provided that the dawt will provide power coefficients higher than the betz limit . these lower power coefficients are also expected according to the bem calculations because dawt ’ s do not run optimally at the same conditions as bare-wind turbines . further theoretical research is planned at clarkson university to correct the bem calculations to match the output . experimental research is planned at the clarkson university wind turbine test site on the wind tamer dawt to compare theoretical results against the working prototype . further theoretical research is planned at clarkson university to correct the bem calculations in order to match the output from the experimental research . also , further theoretical research is planned at clarkson university to analyze the flow field around a 2d and 3d geometry of the wind tamer dawt using cfd calculations . references 1. gilbert , b. and foreman , k. , “ experimental demonstration of the diffuser augmented wind turbine concept ” , grumman aerospace corp. , bethpage , ny . 2. goden , david l. , and eric l. bibeau . `` increasing power density of kinetic turbines for cost-effective distributed power generation .

news release – may 2nd on shore wind turbines : who is looking after public safety ? wind turbines – an accident waiting to happen ? the danger to the public from wind turbines is clearly illustrated by the growing number of accidents worldwide involving giant turbines catching fire , shedding blades or parts of blades and throwing large ice lumps . industrial sized on-shore wind turbines with large rotating blades pose an element of danger to both the public and property in the surrounding area . the fact that these blades rotate at a great height above the ground means that any failure or partial failure of a blade or falling ice can be projected some distance and over a wide area . this danger is increased when turbines are sited in close proximity to high voltage electricity lines , homes and a busy road running in an east to west direction , as in the recent seamer planning applications . two recent events in the uk highlight this growing problem : whittlesey , lincs , december 200 8 : huge lumps of ice were thrown onto homes and gardens from the blades of a giant wind turbine . freezing overnight temperatures had caused the ice to form : the turbine did not turn off automatically when the ice started to shed . people had to take cover as lumps of ice - some two feet long - showered them from the 80 metre high turbine tower . the health and safety executive is now investigating the incident , and the local mp is calling for a public inquiry . manchester , december 2008 : wind energy developer ecoctricity withdrew plans to erect a wind turbine at manchester city stadium because of a `` one in a million '' chance of ice throw . they stated `` we do n't feel that we can accept even this small level of risk . we do n't feel the risk to the public , to the reputation of the club , to ecotricity and to wind energy , is worth taking '' . various methods of combating the problem were considered , but the project was abandoned . present situation the lack of a regulating body to set , monitor and enforce health and safety standards for the wind industry has resulted in confusion and division of responsibility between the various central and local government bodies . with no over-all body in charge , none of the parties involved accepts responsibility for evaluating the dangers and carrying out a risk assessment . the planning process for commercial wind turbine installations does not require or include an assessment of the risk wind turbines pose to the public and property . those involved in processing the developer ’ s planning application include the local planning authority , statutory consultees and local councillors on the planning committee . yet , in the case of the seamer application , it appears that only the local councillors on the planning committees were prepared to acknowledge the risks involved . the developers in submitting a proposal , wind energy developers are required to comply with planning policy statement 22 : renewable energy ( pps22 ) . guidelines are also given in `` planning for renewable energy a companion guide to pps22 '' . both the policy statement and the guidelines were issued in 2004 and have not been updated since then . relevant paragraphs of this document are listed in appendix 1. it is notable that instrumental in the production of the companion guide ( technical annex : wind ) is the british wind energy association , the trade body which looks after the interests of wind energy developers . pps22 recognises the “ danger to human or animal life ” by loss of turbine blade or partial blade and fragments of ice released from the blades , but does not advise how to quantify such danger or how to mitigate against the danger . pps22 also recognises the “ shadow flicker and reflected light ” effect from a wind turbine but limits this effect to “ occur inside buildings ” . it does not consider this effect on users of nearby roads . although it acknowledges the risks from wind turbines , pps22 does not require wind energy developers to carry out a risk assessment . this is effectively a loophole for developers , who are well aware of the risks posed by wind turbines . developers use this loophole when responding to queries regarding risk , merely pointing out that they have complied with pps22 . however , pps22 is outdated , does not adequately describe the risks associated with modern industrial wind turbines , and is widely criticised by many eminent and professional people . fact : developers do not ass ess the risks to the public local planning authorities local planning authorities are driven by the government ’ s targets for renewable energy installations and keen to avoid any penalties imposed by government for failing to meet the targets imposed upon them . local planning authorities apply pps22 guidelines to determine wind energy planning applications . they also engage with statutory consultees , including those with a responsibility for safety , namely highways agency , local highways authority and national grid . however , planning authorities do not involve themselves in risk or health and safety issues with regard to wind turbine applications . in a presentation to bwea in october 2008 , nick summers of the health and safety executive stated : `` when developer seeks planning permission for a wind farm , potential risks to public safety should be assessed within the planning framework process '' `` some risks to public are best addressed through planning controls as well as h & s legislation '' `` promotion of clear guidelines and their application by planning authorities to deal with risks to the public , relevant standards and industry good practice , should minimise risks to the public '' clearly , the health and safety executive believe that risk assessment should be within the remit of local planning authorities . local authorities should therefore incorporate this requirement in their local development framework policies covering wind turbine installations . fact : local planning authorities do not assess the risks to the public highways agency the current policy being used by highways agency is network strategy – spatial planning advice note : sp 04/07 – planning application for wind turbines sited near to trunk roads . however this policy only applies to motorways and trunk roads and is not applied to the majority of planning applications for wind turbines . this policy was issued as a working draft in december 2006 , and issued in march 2007. it was updated in july 2007 and is still in use . relevant paragraphs of this document are listed in appendix1 . this policy recognises the need to locate wind turbines further away from trunk roads than the distance recommended in pps22 . the ha recommendation is turbine height plus 50 metres . with regards to “ shadowing ” or “ flicker ” it recommends : “ ... , a separate , site-specific assessment of risk may be prudent . ” when questions of safety or risk are raised with the planning authority , they pass these on to the developer . the developer 's response is , invariably , not to answer such questions , but to merely state that the planning application complies with pps22 . the developer is responsible for hazards and risks associated with wind turbines . however , the wind industry is self-regulated and if the developer states that he has complied with pps22 , this is accepted by the highways agency and the local planning authority . the identified safety problems or risks associated with trunk roads and road users are then not quantified or mitigated against . fact : the highways agency does not asse ss the risks to the public local highways/ transport authority the local highways/transport authorities do not have policies with regards to wind turbines and rely on their own initiatives when responding to planning applications which affect their road networks . it would seem sensible to utilise the highways agency standard sp 04/07 listed above but local transport authorities choose not to do so . accordingly road users using other than motorways and trunk roads are exposed to a greater level of risk from wind turbines . this is surely illogical , and does not adequately protect the general public . again , if questions of safety or risk are raised with the planning authority , they contact the developer , who in turn assures them that the planning application complies with pps22 . if the developer states that he has complied with pps22 , this is accepted by the local highways/ transport authority and the local planning authority . once again t he identified safety problems or risks associated with roads and road users are then not quantified or mitigated against . fact : the local highways/transport authority does not assess the risks to the public national grid the guideline currently used by developers is national grid ( energy network association ) technical specification 43-8 for `` overhead line clearances '' , issue 3 ( 2004 ) for safe separation to power lines . this indicates fall over distance plus 4 metres but acknowledge that this does not apply to wind turbines . however national grid – internal and contract specific policy statement ( transmission ) issued a new policy entitled “ overhead line separation from wind turbines ps ( t ) 087 – issue 1 – september 2008 ” part 1.2 existing overhead lines states : “ the requirements of 2002 electricity safety , quality and continuity regulations shall be met in regard to both the nature of the equipment and the surrounding land use . all possible measures must be made to safeguard existing ohl assets by seeking to ensure new wind turbines are constructed at a distance more than 5 times the rotor diameter away from any ohl . ” to date , national grid has not applied this policy : they are awaiting supporting data ( expected in the first quarter of 2009 ) . once finalised , it is expected they will apply this policy to all new wind turbine applications . fact : the national grid does not asse ss the risks to the public health and safety executive the health and safety executive plays no roll in the planning process for wind turbines in spite of being the statutory body which issues all the policies with regards to safety and risk associated with protecting people in the workplace . hse starts from the position that : “ a suitable and sufficient risk assessment must be undertaken to determine the measures needed to ensure that risks from the hazard are adequately controlled . ” hse policy : reducing risk protecting people – r2p2 would be an appropriate document to evaluate such risks from wind turbines . however , hse policies only come into effect once the construction of the wind turbines commences , and they cover employees on the site rather than the general public in the vicinity of the site . fact : the health and safety executive does not assess the risks to the public summary who is looking after public safety ? - no one ! ! ! neither the developers , t he local planning authorities , the highways agency , the local highways authority , the national grid nor the health and safety executive assess the risks to the public appendix 1 – pps22 planning policy statement 22 : renewable energy ( pps22 ) and planning for renewable energy a companion guide to pps 22 section 8 - wind covers safety in paragraphs 49 to51 . paragraph 50 states : “ the only source of possible danger to human or animal life from a wind turbine would be the loss of a piece of the blade or , in most exceptional circumstances , of the whole blade . ” nb : there is evidence available that clearly shows the above statement to be untrue as there have been numerous instances of thrown ice , collapsing towers and the frequency of loss of blades , partial or full , is also increasing at an alarming rate . paragraph 51 states : “ the minimum desirable distance between wind turbines and occupied buildings ... .. fall over distance ( i.e . the height of the turbine to the tip of the blade ) plus 10 % is often used as a safe separation distance . ” nb : pps22 does not provide guidance on risk assessment of the effect of blades rotating at tip speeds of up to 180 mph and the projected range of debris from loss of a piece of blade or thrown ice . section 8 - wind also refers to safety in proximity to roads , railways and public rights of way and power lines in paragraphs 52 to 57. paragraph 53 states : although a wind turbine erected in accordance with best engineering practice should be a stable structure , it may be advisable to achieve a set-back from roads and railways of at least fall over distance , so as to achieve maximum safety . ” paragraph 55 states : “ wind turbines should be separated from overhead power lines bin accordance with electricity council standard 44-8 ‘ overhead line clearances ’ . ” nb : electricity council standard 44-8 is now replaced with national grid ( energy network association ) technical specification 43.8 but national grid have confirmed that this specification takes no account of the impact of wind turbines on overhead lines . section 8 - wind covers shadow flicker and reflected light in paragraphs 73 to 78. paragraph 73 states : “ ... it only occurs inside buildings where the flicker appears through a narrow window opening ... . ” nb : pps22 makes no reference to the effect “ flicker or reflected light ” would have on road users . paragraph 76 states : “ ... flicker effects have been proven to occur only within ten rotor diameters of a wind turbine ... . ” nb yet pps 22 allows wind turbines to be site at only height plus 10 % from roads and railways . section 8 - wind covers icing in paragraph 79. paragraph 79 states : “ ... in those areas where icing of blades occur , fragments of ice might be released from the blades when the machine is started ... . ” nb pps22 again identifies the risk but not how to address it or quantify the level of risk . nb pps22 was produced in 2004 and has not been updated since then . appendix 2 – highways agency network strategy – spatial planning advice note : sp 04/07 - planning applications for wind turbines sited near to trunk roads structural collapse is covered in paragraphs 7 and 8. paragraph 7 quotes pps22 and states : “ ... , it may be advisable to achieve a set-back from roads and railways of at least fall distance ( height measured to blade tip ) to achieve maximum safety . ” paragraph 8 states : “ however , given the potential consequences were debris to fall on a busy motorway or trunk road , an additional allowance for debris scatter is necessary in order to truly maximise safety . ” icing is covered in paragraphs 9 to 11. paragraph 10 states : “ warming or fragmentation may then lead to ice being shed from the rotating blades . large fragments may be thrown a considerable distance . ” paragraph 11 states : “ ... nevertheless , the consequences of an ice projectile hitting a moving vehicle could be sever e . not only would the occupants be at risk but a multi-vehicle accident could result . ” location is covered in paragraphs 12 and 13. paragraph 12 states : “ consideration of the risks associated with structural failure and ‘ icing ’ identifies the clear need to incorporate a safety margin in the offset between the trunk road boundary and the siting of a wind turbine ... ... commercial turbines should be se back a distance equal to height + 50 metres . ” ‘ shadowing ’ or ‘ flicker ’ is covered in paragraph 21. this states : “ a final source of potential distraction is moving shadows across the carriageway by rotating blades . this should be ameliorated considerably by the suggested offset . however , a separate , site-specific assessment of risk may be prudent . ” wind turbulence is covered in paragraphs 22 and 23. paragraph 22 states : “ ... the distance over which the turbulence of a turbine can be felt ( its wake ) can be up to three times the rotor diameter in distance . therefore , care should be taken when locating turbines at sites where non-motorised road users are likely to be passing . paragraph 23 states : in such circumstances , a site specific assessment should be undertaken and , if necessary , effective screening should be provided to shield non-motorised users from the generated air turbulence . ” nb this policy was issued a working draft in december 2006 , and issued in march 2007. it was updated in july 2007 and is still in use . working note : purpose of this document to highlight the fact that no risk assessment is done/required by local authority , highways authority etc . ; that the wind industry is self-regulated and has no over-arching regulatory body ( covering letters to be created for local mp 's , mep 's , cllrs , planning authority ) to raise awareness of these issues by seeking national and local press coverage ( covering letters to be created for dt ( christopher booker ) , dex , necho , d & s t , evg.gaz.. ) january 2009 page page 1

abstract : increasing levels of wind power penetration in modern power systems has set intensively high standards with respect to wind turbine technology during the last years . security issues have become rather critical and operation of wind farms as conventional power plants is becoming a necessity as wind turbines replace conventional units on the production side . this article includes a review of the basic control issues regarding the capability of the doubly fed induction generator ( dfig ) wind turbine configuration to fulfill the basic technical requirements set by the system operators and contribute to power system security . an overview of ancillary services provided by wind turbine technology nowadays is provided , i.e . , fault ride-through capability , reactive power supply and frequency-active power control . keywords : wind turbine ; fault ride-through ; power control ; reactive power ; frequency control

disturbances . wind turbines could be disconnected when abnormal grid voltage behavior was detected . the constantly increasing penetration of wind power in the power systems over the last years has posed serious concerns regarding the sudden loss of power during grid faults , which could be caused by wind turbines´disconnection , leading possibly to further severe frequency and/or voltage instability . these concerns have led to detailed review of national grid codes , which nowadays include a wide range of technical requirements that wind farms must fulfill [ 1 ] . the operational behavior of wind farms has to follow today the basic guidelines , which have been up to now traditionally only referred to conventional power stations . in this article the capability of the dfig configuration to fulfill the main technical requirements , common to most national grid codes , will be presented . the following wind turbine ancillary services are addressed and discussed in the article [ 2–4 ] :  capability to regulate their power production during normal operation—according to several national grid codes , wind farms must be able to regulate their power production to an imposed reference value , set remotely or locally [ 1 ] . the capability of the dfig wind turbine to independently control active and reactive power and provide the corresponding service is assessed and emphasized in normal operation conditions by means of simulations . fault ride through ( frt ) capability—the ability of modern wind turbines to withstand low voltage conditions , which mostly appear during short circuit faults in the grid , stay connected during the fault and resume their pre-fault normal operation shortly after the fault clearance is essential . advanced design of the wind turbine controller and/or development of new equipment in wind turbines are necessary to enable the wind turbine to fulfill this requirement , which is usually described in grid codes through definitions of the duration and the depth of a voltage drop at which the wind turbines are not allowed to disconnect . voltage-reactive power control capability—in most grid codes wind farms are asked to support the voltage of the power system in normal operation , by providing or absorbing reactive power . the reactive power supply capability largely depends on the specific wind turbine technology . variable speed wind turbine schemes , like the dfig studied here , are nowadays able to provide additional reactive power through advanced control of their power electronics . some particular grid codes , such as e-on netz and the spanish one , require voltage support through reactive current injection during fault operation as well . the present paper reveals for instance how a dfig wind turbine equipped with a co-ordinated voltage control system can enhance the grid support , even during abnormal voltage conditions . frequency-active power control capability—a crucial aspect related to system stability is active power balance in the system . frequency stability is often seriously threatened during events , i.e . , sudden load change , tripping of a production unit due to protection reasons . as wind farms tend to substitute conventional units in the power system , they are often required to remain connected during frequency variations while in the future they should also contribute actively to the generation control of the system [ 5 ] . the wind turbines have to adjust their power output according to frequency deviations although the fluctuating nature of wind poses serious constraints regarding the availability of active power . this feature becomes vital for non interconnected power systems , like island systems , whose inertia is restricted and frequency variations often lead to severe load shedding .

the dfig wind turbine configuration , which nowadays represents the mainstream configuration for large wind turbines [ 6 ] , is illustrated in figure 1. the main electrical components , as well as the mechanical parts and the controllers , have to be considered in the model in order to ensure a realistic response . as the model used in this study for the dfig wind turbine configuration is described in detail in [ 7 ] , only a brief summary is presented in the following . figure 1. system configuration of a dfig wind turbine .

control system rotor side converter grid side converter

the dfig system is essentially a wound rotor induction generator with slip rings , with the stator directly connected to the grid and with the rotor interfaced through a back-to-back partial-scale power converter [ 8 ] . the converter consists of two conventional voltage source converters ( rotor-side converter rsc and grid-side converter gsc ) and a dc-bus . a two-mass model is usually used to represent the drive train to illustrate the dynamic impact of wind turbines on the grid properly . a large mass for the wind turbine rotor and a small mass for the generator are thus connected by a flexible shaft characterized by stiffness and damping for the low-speed shaft . a simplified aerodynamic model , based on a two-dimensional aerodynamic torque coefficient cq table [ 8 ] , is typically sufficient for such studies . the control system consists of a pitch controller and an electrical control for the converters . the pitch control system is realized by a pi controller with antiwind-up , using a servomechanism model with limitation of both the pitch angle and its rate of change . as the pitch angle directly controls the generator speed to its reference signal , this control is able to prevent over-speeding both in normal operations and during grid faults , by limiting the mechanical power extracted from the wind and thus restoring the balance between electrical and mechanical power . 2.1. power production regulation during normal operation the electrical control system , depicted in figure 2 , is essential for an effective behavior of a dfig wind turbine during normal operation . decoupled control of active and reactive power is applied through vector control techniques [ 8 ] , allowing for changes in the active and reactive power in the range of milliseconds . the rsc controls mainly the active and reactive power delivered to the grid ,

while the gsc ensures nominal voltage at the common dc-bus and a unity power factor operation of the converter . as illustrated in figure 2 and described in detail in [ 9–11 ] , the control of the converters is based on cascade control loops : a very fast inner current controller regulates the currents to the reference values that are specified by the outer slower power controller . the power controller implements the maximum power point ( mpp ) tracking strategy , which ensures power optimization at low wind speeds . figure 2. converter control and pitch control system of the dfig wind turbine for normal operation .

figure 3 illustrates the ability of the variable speed wind turbine with dfig to regulate its power production to an imposed reference value . a simulation is thus performed , where the reference power is reduced from 2 mw to 1 mw between 100 and 250 seconds and stepped back up again to 2 mw . the active and reactive power response is given for turbulent wind with a mean wind speed close to the rated . notice that independent of the fluctuations of the wind , the active power is following its reference very well . for the first 300 s the reactive power is controlled to zero , following the unity power factor strategy . then the reactive power reference is set to 0.5 mvar . figure 3 points out that the control strategy of the variable speed wind turbine model with dfig is able to control active and reactive power independently to specific imposed values . this enhances the ability of modern wind farms to operate like conventional power plants . decoupled active and reactive power control enhance the dfig operation for several requirements of power control , which are being introduced to grid codes nowadays , e.g . , balance control , stop control , absolute power limitation , delta limitation , fast down regulation and ramp limitation to support system security .

2.2. fault ride-through ( frt ) capability according to the fault ride-through requirements defined in most grid codes , wind turbines have to remain connected to the grid during voltage dips . the dfig wind turbine configuration is sensitive to grid faults and requires special power converter protection , because high inrush stator and rotor currents can appear during grid faults . the protection of the converter against overcurrents , but also of the generator rotor and the dc-link against overvoltages , is ensured via the so-called crowbar . in principle , the crowbar is an external rotor impedance , coupled via the slip rings to the generator rotor . according to the strategy implemented in this survey , when the crowbar is triggered , the rotor side converter ( rsc ) is disabled and bypassed , and therefore the independent controllability of active and reactive power is lost . since the grid side converter ( gsc ) is not directly connected to the generator windings , where the high transient currents occur , this converter is not blocked by the protection system during grid faults . when the crowbar is removed , the rsc is enabled again to control independently the active and reactive power .

energies 2010 , 3

in the case of a grid fault , the power reference is defined as the output of a damping controller [ 7,8 ] . when a fault is detected , the definition of the power reference is thus switched between the normal operation definition ( i.e . , mpp ) and the fault operation definition ( damping controller ) . figure 4 depicts the control system applied for frt as well as the voltage control , which will be described in the next section . figure 4. control system of the dfig wind turbine for frt and voltage control .

it is worth noting that during grid faults , the pitch control system is not able to damp the torsional oscillations , because of several delay mechanisms in the pitch [ 8 ] . the pitch control damps the slow frequency variations in the generator speed , while the damping controller is able to damp the fast oscillations in the generator speed . the effect of the damping controller both on the electrical and the mechanical parts of the turbine for a voltage dip down to 20 % from the rated voltage with 100 ms duration is illustrated in figure 5. the sudden drop of the voltage leads to drop in the stator and rotor flux , which result in a decrease of the electromagnetic torque . the drive train acts as a torsion spring and gets untwisted during faults and consequently the mechanical torque drops too . however , the mechanical torque drops slower than the electromagnetic torque and therefore the generator starts to accelerate . the effect of the damping controller , which acts directly on the active power reference signal , is very crucial . this controller damps actively the torsional excitations in the drive train system following the grid fault . when no damping controller is used , both the oscillations in the mechanical torque and in the generator speed remain undamped and would cause severe mechanical stress in the drive train , possibly leading to disconnection of the wind turbine by the protection system . the comparison reveals the positive effect of the damping controller on the response of the wind turbine .

2.3. enhanced reactive power support wind farms are required to provide reactive power regulation like conventional power plants during power system voltage deviations . in the applied control strategy the rsc is the default reactive power source controlling the voltage at the point of common coupling ( pcc ) during normal operation . at a fault instant , i.e . , a short circuit in the grid , the gsc is supplementing reactive power during the blocking of the rsc , which occurs when the crowbar is triggered . in this case the gsc continues its operation as statcom . after the removal of the crowbar the rsc starts to operate and the gsc is controlled to unity power factor as in normal operation [ 12 ] . figure 6 shows the results from a voltage dip at the terminals . the short circuit ratio ( scr ) calculated at the pcc is 1.9 and the r/x ratio in the pcc amounts to 0.14 [ 13 ] . at the fault instance , the crowbar is coupled in the dfig´ rotor circuit . figure 6 illustrates the s response for two different control strategies : with and without reactive power boosting of the grid side converter . in the first case , during crowbar coupling the gsc contributes to reactive power supply and improves the voltage level . the reference power of the reactive power boosting for the gsc is set to 1 p.u . , i.e . , its maximum possible . since the voltage level is significantly reduced during the fault , the grid side converter ’ s reactive power production capability is also reduced . thus , the reference reactive power can not be provided during the fault .

after fault clearing , when the voltage at the converter terminals re-establishes , the gsc is able to provide even more reactive power to the grid . due to the reactive power demand of the generator , when the fault is cleared , the voltage does not completely recover immediately . the generator operates

as a squirrel cage induction generator and has an increased magnetization demand during the voltage recovery . the generator absorbs reactive power from the grid , delaying the recovering process of the grid voltage . when the crowbar is removed and the rotor side converter is restarted , the voltage controller of the rotor side converter provides for reactive power supply re-establishing the voltage level . 2.4. frequency-active power control among the ancillary services that modern wind turbines have to provide , frequency control appears as an emerging need , especially in non-interconnected power systems with increasing wind power penetration . in such power systems , load shedding regularly occurs due to large frequency deviations . although sufficient spinning reserve by conventional units is ensured to overcome frequency problems , increasing wind power penetration is often challenging system security for non-interconnected systems . depending on their configuration wind turbines have a different response to frequency deviations . figures 7 and 8 illustrate the results from a study for an island system , rhodes , for the case scenario when total wind power production is 28.2 mw ( 34 % ) in total 83 mw of demand [ 14 ] . the loss of the largest conventional unit in the system ( 21 mw ) is simulated—production loss equal to 25 % of the total demand . a comparison between the inertia responses of three different wind turbine configurations is given in figure 7 during medium wind speeds of 9–10 m/s . it is seen that the active stall induction generator ( asig ) wind turbines provide a significant dynamic response , while the response of the variable speed wind turbines—doubly fed induction generator and permanent magnet synchronous generator ( pmsg ) —is negligible . figure 7. change in active power production during a frequency drop for three wind turbine configurations .

as described in [ 15,16 ] , the response of a dfig wind turbine is very different than of asig wind turbines . its inertial is mostly based on the applied control scheme acting on the converter connecting the rotor to the grid . supplementary control attributes have been proposed in the literature in order to achieve active frequency control by variable speed wind turbines [ 17,18 ] . in this article two different frequency control methods are presented for the dfig wind turbine configuration :   inertia control droop control

energies 2010 , 3

1299

when inertia control is used , the inertial response of the dfig is restored through an additional loop in the power reference block providing the active power reference signal to the rotor side converter , ( see figure 8 ) . the dfig wind turbine is ordered to adjust its power output when subjected to frequency deviations , based on the measurement of the rate of change of the frequency . this defines the additional power reference signal , which is added to the normal power reference provided by the mpp tracking controller [ 14 ] . in droop control , the auxiliary input signal that defines the adjustment in the power production of the wind turbine is the actual error between the measured frequency of the system and the nominal frequency . this control method is similar to the primary frequency control applied to conventional generators . figure 8. frequency control scheme for the dfig wind turbine configuration .

notice that when no auxiliary frequency control is applied , the frequency drops below 48.5 hz , leading to load shedding which prevents further frequency drop . in the other two cases , where the frequency control is activated in the dfig wind farms , the load shedding is totally avoided . the optimum frequency drop in terms of minimum frequency is achieved through droop control . the effect of auxiliary frequency control on the maximum rate of change of frequency is very crucial . as illustrated in figure 9 , the initial rate of change of frequency is very high . the inertia of the system in this case is low because the number of the conventional generators connected to the system is reduced . the rate of change of frequency is close to 5 hz/sec ( in absolute value ) when no auxiliary control is applied . inertia control manages to reduce the rate to 3.8 hz/sec , while droop control does not affect this rate . figure 9 illustrates also the change in the active power output of the wind farm during the frequency deviation for each one of the implemented methods . 3. conclusions increasing penetration levels of wind power demands constant development in the field of wind turbine technology . this article assesses and illustrates modeling issues for variable speed dfig wind turbines regarding ancillary services provided to the grid , during both normal operation and transient events . the converter control is enhanced to provide with active and reactive power regulation capability . an active crowbar protection system is included in the protection system , ensuring safe operation of the wind turbine during severe voltage dips , which occur in the power system e.g . due to faults . uninterrupted operation is ensured and dfig wind turbines are able to support the grid immediately after the fault clearance , supplementing with reactive power . possible oscillations which may occur during transient events can be damped through an additional damping controller . voltage and reactive power control are possible when coordinated control is applied between the grid side converter and the rotor side converter . thus , dfig wind turbines contribute significantly to system stability in case of reactive power imbalances in the power system . auxiliary frequency control makes it possible for such wind turbines to participate in the primary control service of the system during frequency events , e.g . sudden loss of production . power electronic technology enables nowadays wind turbines to be active components of power systems and participate in the major services traditionally served by conventional power plants . this article assessed the main control functions which enable the dfig wind turbine configuration to contribute to safe and secure operation of modern power systems .

redefining the global energy game
the world is facing an energy and climate crisis . globally , the energy sector emits 26 billion tonnes of co2 each year and electricity production alone accounts for 41 % of emissions . the international energy agency expects co2 emissions in 2030 to have increased by 55 % to reach more than 40 billion tonnes of co2 . the share of emissions coming from electricity production will increase to 44 % in 2030 , reaching 18 billion tonnes of co21 . europe is going to be importing a growing share of its energy at unpredictable but most likely higher prices , from unstable regions , in ever-fiercer competition with the rest of the world and at staggering environmental cost . spare electricity generating capacity is at a historic low . europe has to invest in new capacity to replace ageing plants and meet future demand . in the period 2005-2030 , the eu needs to install 862 gw of new electricity generating capacity . 427 gw of generating capacity will be retired in the eu and an additional 435 gw will be needed to satisfy the growing demand for power . the required capacity exceeds the total capacity operating in europe ( 723 gw ) . satisfying our energy needs over the coming decades will be a big challenge . for a region that currently imports 56 % 2 of its energy – and is on track to reach 70 % in the next 20 to 30 years3 – the challenge is big . our own fossil fuel resources are running out fast , fuel prices are increasing and the environment is suffering as result of our current energy supply structure . in 2030 the eu will be importing 84 % of its gas , 59 % of its coal and 94 % of its oil . every day , european companies and consumers are paying the price of external control of their energy supply . europe ’ s annual gas import bill alone is already €50 billion higher today than when the oil price was $ 20 per barrel a few years ago . europe must seize the opportunity created by the large turnover in electricity generating capacity that will take place over the next two decades to secure a truly indigenous clean energy supply based on renewable sources of energy – the only resources that will be left in abundance in the near future . combined with more ambitious energy efficiency measures , renewable heating and biofuels , it is the only way for europe to turn the looming energy and climate crisis into an opportunity to benefit the welfare of our citizens . europe simply does not have the fossil fuel resources to emerge as a winner in the battle for the world ’ s remaining and diminishing fuel supplies . but it does have enormously rich renewable energy resources , and european industries are world leaders at turning those resources into energy .

pure power – wind energy scenarios up to 2030

there is an opportunity for europe to take the lead in redefining the rules of the future energy game . it is a game that will be won not by the few countries that control the diminishing fossil fuel resources , but by the regions of the world that understand how to develop , utilise and export technology that can convert their natural renewable resources into energy . the economic future of europe can be planned on the basis of known and predictable energy costs , derived from an indigenous wind energy source free from all the security-related , political , economic and environmental disadvantages associated with the current energy supply structure . this report looks at what the change towards large-scale wind energy will mean in concrete terms . it presents new scenarios for wind energy up to 2030 , examining the effects they would have on electricity , greenhouse gas emissions and the eu economy . by assessing potential impacts , europe can take informed decisions and go into the future with its eyes open , certain of the real advantages that seizing the wind energy opportunity today will bring the citizens of tomorrow .

executive summary : a new scenario for wind energy
over the last eight years , only new gas capacity has exceeded new wind power capacity in the eu . since 2000 , 30 % of all installed electricity generating capacity in the eu has been wind power . while wind energy today meets 3.7 % of eu ’ s electricity demand , the technology is already the second largest contributor to economic activity and employment in the area of power plant manufacturing . in 2003 , the european wind energy association set the target of 75,000 mw installed in the eu-15 by 2010 and 180,000 mw by 20204. back then , it was expected that 54,350 mw would be operating by the end of 2006. the actual figure for end 2007 was 55,860 mw in eu-15 . in this updated scenario , the term “ target ” has been changed for 2010 to “ prediction ” in order to reflect that 2010 is only three years into the future . consequently there is more certainty that the 2010 projections will materialise than in the previous scenario in 2003. this scenario will continue to refer to the 2020 and 2030 projections as “ targets ” given the substantially higher uncertainty at that time scale . the new 2010 prediction for wind energy in europe has been updated to include the 12 new member states , which are expected to add 2,050 mw to the eu total by 2010 , while the eu-15 will have 4 % more capacity installed by 2010 ( 77,950 mw ) , compared to the previous target of 75,000 mw . in total , ewea believes that 80,000 mw of wind power will be operating in the eu-27 by the end of the decade . offshore wind energy is expected to reach 3,500 mw ( 4 % of total capacity ) in 2010 compared to 1,080 ( 2 % of total capacity ) by the end of 2006. the european commission ’ s 1997 white paper on renewable sources of energy set a target for 40,000 mw of wind power to be installed in the eu by 2010. that target was reached in 2005 , five years ahead of schedule . the overall white paper target included an increase in electricity production from renewable energy sources of 338 twh between 1995 and 2010. as ewea ’ s analysis shows , wind power is expected to produce 177 twh in 2010 , thereby meeting 52 % of the overall white paper target . ewea maintains the target it set in 2003 of 180,000 mw by 2020. in addition , the analysis has been expanded to include a target for the year 2030 of 300,000 mw , 40 % of which is expected to be offshore wind power . there is , however substantial uncertainty regarding the 2020 and 2030 targets and much depends on the timing and scale of the offshore segment of the business . wind power has experienced dramatic growth over the last years , and in 2007 there are five eu countries – denmark , spain , portugal , ireland and germany – which have more than 5 % of their electricity demand covered by wind energy . the development of wind power is not different from the initial development stages of other power sources . fig 0.1 shows the global development of wind energy ( 1961-1976 ) compared with nuclear power ( 1991-2006 ) . the strong development of wind power to date can continue in the coming years as long as the clear commitment of the european union and its member states to wind power development continues to strengthen , and as long as this support is translated into the construction of wind farms . it is vital for the future development of wind power in europe that the european parliament and the council swiftly adopt the new eu renewables energy directive ( tabled by the european commission on 23 january 2008 ) .

the european parliament has for many years been calling for a mandatory 25 % target for renewable energy by 2020. the gradual implementation of the 2001 renewable electricity directive in the member states , as well as the european council ’ s unanimous decision for a 20 % share of renewable energy in the eu by 2020 at its spring summit in march 2007 , are all steps in the right direction and indicators of increased political commitment . the share of renewable energy needs to go up from 8.5 % in 2005 to 20 % in 2020 , which means that more than one third of the eu ’ s electricity will need to come from renewables , up from 15 % . it is already clear that wind energy will be the largest contributor to the increase . the 20 % target , combined with the dramatic increases in fossil fuel prices experienced since our 2003 analysis indicate that the long-term future for wind power remains promising and that europe could achieve 300 gw of wind power capacity by 2030 if regulatory uncertainty can be minimised . the european commission5 expects a 73 % decline in eu oil production between 2000 and 2030. gas production will fall by 59 % and coal by 41 % . by 2030 , the eu will be importing 94 % of its oil , 84 % of its gas and 59 % of its coal . europe can go a long way towards an energy supply that is superior to the business-as-usual scenario , offering greater energy independence , lower energy costs , reduced fuel price risk , improved competitiveness and more technology exports . over the coming 25 years , wind energy will play a major role in that development . the following tables show the wind industry ’ s targets for the eu-27 in 2007 , 2010 , 2020 and 2030 in terms of installed capacity . they also demonstrate what this means in terms of electricity supply , co2 savings , avoided fuel costs and investments in wind energy machinery .

eu energy mix

between 2000 and 2007 total eu power capacity increased by 200 gw to reach 775 gw by the end of 2007. the most notable change in the mix of capacity is the near doubling of gas capacity to 164 gw . wind energy more than quadrupled from 13 gw to 57 gw6 . the addition of ten new member states in may 2004 put another 112 gw into the eu generation mix in 2005 , including 80 gw of coal , 12 gw of large hydro , 12 gw of natural gas , 6.5 gw of nuclear and 186 mw of wind power .

changes in net installed capacity among the various electricity generating technologies are shown in figure 1.1. the figures include the eu-10 from 2005 and eu-12 from 2007. the growth of natural gas and wind power has happened at the expense of fuel oil , coal and , to a lesser extent , nuclear power . in 2007 , 21.2 gw of new capacity was installed in the eu-27 of which 10.7 gw was gas ( 50 % ) and 8.6 gw was wind power ( 40 % ) . gas and wind power also lead the field if decommissioning of old capacity is taken into account . net installation of power capacity in the eu totalled 98 gw between 2000 and 2007. gas and wind power accounted for 77 gw and 47 gw respectively while more oil ( -14 gw net ) , coal ( -11 gw net ) and nuclear ( -6 gw net ) capacity has been removed than installed since 2000 .

the share of total eu capacity from natural gas has more than doubled since 1995 to reach 21 % . coal ’ s share is unchanged while oil , large hydro and nuclear have all decreased their share . wind energy ’ s share has increased from 0 % in 1995 to 7 % in 2007 .

the european commission ’ s 1997 white paper target of 40,000 mw wind power capacity by 2010 in the eu was reached in 2005 , five years ahead of time . by the end of 2007 , there was 56,535 mw of wind power capacity installed in the eu-27 , of which 55,860 mw was in the eu-15 . ewea ’ s previous scenario , drawn up in october 2003 , expected 54,350 mw to be installed in the eu-15 by the end of 2007. thus the total capacity was underestimated by 1,510 mw over the five year period . in 2003 ewea expected total annual installations in 2007 to be 6,600 mw , whereas the actual market was significantly higher at 8,291 mw in the eu-15 ( 8,554 mw in the eu-27 ) . in the eu , installed wind power capacity has increased by an average of 25 % annually over the past eleven years , from 4,753 mw in 1997 to 56,535 mw in 2007. in terms of annual installations , the eu market for wind turbines has grown by 19 % annually , from 1,277 mw in 1997 to 8,554 mw in 2007. in 2007 , spain ( 3,522 mw ) was by far the largest market for wind turbines , followed by germany ( 1,667 mw ) , france ( 888 mw ) and italy ( 603 mw ) . eight countries – germany , spain , denmark , italy , france , the uk , portugal , and the netherlands – now have more than 1,000 mw installed . germany , spain and denmark – the three pioneering countries of wind power – are home to 72 % of the eu 's installed wind power capacity . that share is expected to decrease to 62 % of installed capacity in 2010 .

the total wind power capacity installed at the end of 2007 will produce 3.7 % of the eu-27 electricity demand in a normal wind year . wind power in denmark covers more than 20 % of its total electricity consumption , by far the largest share of any country in the world . five eu countries – denmark , spain , portugal , ireland , and germany – have more than 5 % of their electricity demand produced by wind energy8 .

by the end of 2007 , 116 kw of wind energy capacity was installed for every 1,000 people in the eu . denmark tops the list with 579 kw/1,000 people followed by spain ( 367 kw ) and germany ( 270 kw ) . if all eu countries had installed the same amount of wind power capacity per population as spain , total installation in the eu would be 180,000 mw , equal to ewea ’ s 2020 target . if all eu countries had the same amount of capacity per capita as denmark , total eu installations would be 282,000 mw , slightly less than the ewea 's 2030 target .

8 source : eurelectric and ewea the national wind power shares are calculated by taking the electricity that the capacity installed by the end of 2007 will produce in a normal wind year and dividing it by the actual 2006 electricity demand . the statistical methodology used differs from the methodology otherwise used throughout this report , which explains the difference of 0.1 % for the total eu share . the figures may differ from the shares reported by national wind energy associations due to difference in methodology .

there are 12.2 mw of wind power capacity installed per 1,000 km2 of land area in the eu ( fig . 2.12 ) . not surprisingly , being a small country , wind power density is highest in denmark but germany is a close second . it is interesting that spain ’ s wind power density is less than half that of germany , indicating a large remaining potential – at least from a visual perspective . the netherlands , portugal and luxembourg are also above the eu average . many geographically large member states , e.g . france , sweden , finland , poland and italy , still have very low density relative to the first-mover countries . if sweden had the same wind power density as germany , there would be more than 28 gw of wind power capacity installed in sweden ( 0.8 gw was operating by end 2007 ) and france would have more than 34 gw of wind power capacity ( compared to 2.5 gw in december 2007 ) . the total installed capacity of wind power by the end of 2007 will , in an average wind year , avoid the emission of 91 mt of co2 . figure 2.13 shows the co2 avoided due to turbines installed by end 2007 as percentages of the member states ’ 1990 greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions ( the base-year of the kyoto protocol ) . it assumes that wind power displaces the average eu amount of co2 per kwh .

pure power – wind energy scenarios up to 2030

21

however , caution must be applied when interpreting the results , since one kwh of wind power avoids far more co2 in for example poland , where the share of coal power production is much higher than the eu average , and avoids far less in for example france , where wind power mainly replaces gas at the intermediate load . overall , the wind power capacity installed by the end of 2007 avoids the emission of 91.3 mt of co2 , of which 90.1 is avoided in the eu-15 which has a common obligation under the kyoto protocol of cutting ghg emissions by -8 % compared to 1990 levels . the new member states have individual targets ( excluding malta and cyprus which have no obligation ) . the wind power installed in the eu-15 by the end of 2007 reduces co2 emissions by 2.1 % of 1990 ghg emissions , equal to 26 % of the bloc ’ s kyoto obligation .

3. evolution

of targets

the european commission white paper of 1997 on renewable sources of energy set the goal of doubling the share of renewable energy in the eu ’ s energy mix from 6 % to 12 % by 2010. it included a target of 40,000 mw for wind power in eu by 2010 , producing 80 twh and saving 72 million tonnes of co2 . the 40,000 mw target was reached in 2005. another target of the white paper was to increase the share of electricity from renewable energy sources ( res-e ) from 337 twh in 1995 to 675 twh in 2010. by the end of 2007 , there was 56,535 mw of wind power capacity installed in the eu , producing 119 twh of electricity and saving approx . 90 tonnes of co2 annually . the european commission ’ s white paper was followed by directive 2001/77/ec on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources . it is the most important piece of legislation ever introduced for renewables , and has led the 27 member states to develop frameworks for investment in renewables , including financial instruments and ways of overcoming administrative barriers and grid access barriers . the directive sets national indicative targets for the contribution of electricity from renewables as a percentage of gross electricity consumption . the overall goal set out in the directive is to increase the share of electricity coming from renewable from 14 % in 1997 to 22 % in 2010. with the enlargement , the overall eu target was adjusted to 21 % of electricity consumption . the 40,000 mw goal from the european commission ’ s white paper naturally formed ewea ’ s target in 1997 , but three years later , due to the strong developments in the german , spanish and danish markets for wind turbines , ewea increased its target by 50 % to 60,000 mw by 2010 and 150,000 mw by 2020. in 2003 , ewea once again increased its target , this time by 25 % to 75,000 mw by 2010 and 180,000 mw in 2020. due to the expansion of the eu with ten new member states , ewea is now increasing its prediction for 2010 to 80,000 mw , maintaining its 2020 target of 180,000 mw and setting a target of 300,000 mw by 2030 .

baseline scenarios
both the european commission and the international energy agency publish baseline scenarios for the development of various electricity generation technologies , including wind energy . in 1996 , one year before adopting its white paper target of 40 gw of wind power by 2010 , the european commission estimated that 8 gw would be installed by 2010 in the eu . the 8 gw was reached in 1999. the commission ’ s target for 2020 was set at 12.3 gw and was reached , two decades ahead of schedule , in 2000. since 1996 , european commission has changed its baseline four times . over the ten year period , targets for wind energy in 2010 and 2020 have been increased tenfold from 8 gw to 78 gw ( 2010 ) and from 12 gw to 128 gw ( 2020 ) in its latest baseline scenario from 2006. ewea ’ s 2010 target for wind energy doubled from 40 gw ( in 1997 ) to 80 gw ( in 2006 ) . while there seems to be consistency between the ewea and the european commission forecasts for 2010 , the ewea baseline , or ‘ reference ’ scenario for 2020 is 70 gw higher than the commission ’ s baseline . for 2030 , the commission assumes 185 gw while ewea assumes 300 gw . the international energy agency ( iea ) is also making baseline scenarios for the development of wind power . in 2002 the agency estimated that 33 gw would be installed in europe in 2010 , 57 gw by 2020 and 71 gw by 2030. two years later , in 2004 , it doubled its forecast for wind energy to 66 gw in 2010 and more than doubled its 2020 and 2030 business as usual scenario for wind in the eu to 131 gw in 2020 and 170 gw in 2030. in 2006 , the iea again increased its 2030 target for wind power in the eu to 217 gw ( its alternapure power – wind energy scenarios up to 2030

both the european commission ’ s and iea ’ s advanced scenarios from 2004 are in line with the 80 gw target in 2010 from ewea . however , the 2020 and 2030 targets from iea and the european commission are significantly below ewea ’ s targets . the 2006 iea alternative policy scenario for the eu ( 151 gw in 2020 ) is , somewhat surprisingly , only 1 gw higher than its reference scenario . its 2030 alternative policy scenario is a mere 6 gw higher than its reference scenario ( 217 gw ) . the european commission ’ s advanced 2006 scenarios are more in line with the ewea targets , and even exceed ewea ’ s targets for 2020 .

wind power scenarios to 2030

while ewea is fairly confident about the projections of wind power in the eu to 2010 , there is uncertainty about the targets for 2020 and 2030. the prospects for a significant market for offshore wind power has been pushed beyond the 2010 timeframe , predominantly as a result of strong onshore wind market growth in usa , china and india in recent years . much also depends on the future eu regulatory framework for the period after 2010. consequently , this report introduces three scenarios – low , reference and high – for the development of wind energy up to 2030. the offshore scenarios up to 2020 are based on scenarios established by ewea in december 200710 .

much of the development over the coming two decades depends on the evolution of the offshore market , over which there is currently some uncertainty . in december 2007 , the european commission announced an eu action plan for offshore wind energy , which is expected to be published in the second half of 2008. as mentioned , ewea ’ s reference scenario assumes 180 gw in 2020 and 300 gw in 2030. the eu will have 350 gw ( including 150 gw offshore ) in the high scenario and 200 gw ( including 40 gw offshore ) in the low scenario . the 56.5 gw of installed capacity in the eu-27 by the end of 2007 will , in a normal wind year , produce 119 twh of electricity , enough to meet 3.7 % of eu electricity demand . in terms of wind power ’ s electricity production and its share of total eu power demand , there are large differences between the three scenarios . much also depends on whether total electricity demand in the eu increases according to the european commission ’ s business as usual ( bau ) scenario or stabilises according to its energy efficiency and high renewables scenario ( eff ) .

as can be seen from table below , wind power will produce between 176 twh ( low case ) and 179 twh ( high case ) in 2010 , between 361 twh and 556 twh in 2020 , and between 571 twh and 1,104 twh in 2030. the bottom table shows that in ewea ’ s reference scenario , wind energy meets between 5 % ( bau ) and 5.2 % ( eff ) of eu electricity demand in 2010 , between 11.6 % and 14.3 % in 2020 , and between 20.8 % and 28.2 % in 2030 , depending on how overall electricity consumption develops in the eu between now and 2030. the calculations in the following chapters of this report are based on ewea ’ s reference scenario and the european commission ’ s business as usual scenario for electricity consumption .

it is assumed that the average capacity factor of all wind turbines in the eu will increase from 24 % in 2007 to 25.3 % in 2010 and 30.3 % in 2020. the increase will be due to better design , exploiting the resources in more windy areas of europe , technology improvements and a larger share of offshore wind . in germany , average capacity factors will only start increasing if older turbines start being replaced , and offshore wind power takes off . it should be noted that for a technology that makes use of a free resource , high capacity factors are not a goal in itself . it is not technically problematic to increase capacity factors , but doing so affects grid integration , modelling and generation costs .

5. prediction

for 2010

ewea ’ s prediction for 2010 has been adjusted from 75 gw ( set in 2003 ) to 80 gw to take account of the new member states . it assumes approx . 23.5 gw of wind installations in the years 2008-2010. the danish wind energy consultancy btm consult foresees a cumulative installed capacity of 92 gw by the end of 2010. the main growth markets it highlights are portugal , france and the uk . by end 2007 , 1.9 % of wind capacity in eu was offshore , producing 3.4 % of total wind power in europe . in 2010 , ewea expects 4.4 % of total capacity and 16 % of the annual market to be offshore wind . offshore wind power ’ s share of total eu wind energy production will increase to 7 % by 2010. the 56.5 gw of installed capacity in the eu-27 by the end of 2007 will , in a normal wind year , produce 119 twh of electricity , enough to meet 3.7 % of eu electricity demand . the capacity installed by the end of 2010 will produce 177 twh in a normal wind year , equal to 5.0 % of demand in 2010 ( 5.7 % of 2006 demand ) . with efficiency measures , wind power ’ s share would be 5.2 % of electricity demand in 2010. germany is projected to reach 25 gw and spain 20 gw of wind capacity in 2010. france , the uk , italy , portugal and the netherlands constitute a second wave of stable markets and will install 42 % of eu capacity over the period . for 2008 , the eu market is expected to fall back to its 2006 level and increase slightly up to 2010 when it should reach 8,200 mw . the forecast assumes that the negotiations on the new eu renewable energy directive and the subsequent development of national action plans in the member states could cause some legal uncertainty until implemented .

in the three-year period 2007-2010 , ewea forecasts that 23.5 gw of wind energy capacity , including 2.4 gw offshore , will be installed , equal to total investments of €31 billion . germany and spain ’ s share of the european annual market will be 34 % , compared to 60 % in 2007 and 80 % in 2002 , confirming the healthy trend towards less reliance on the first-mover markets . the largest markets in the period are expected to be spain ( 20.7 % ) , germany ( 14.4 % ) , france ( 12.1 % ) , uk ( 11.6 % ) , and italy ( 7.6 % ) . the total includes an additional , 102 mw of capacity assumed to be build as a result of replacement of turbines installed prior to 1991 .

the total installed capacity of wind power by end 2010 will , in an average wind year , avoid the emission of 133 mt of co2 . fig . 5.4 shows the avoided co2 of turbines installed by end 2010 as percentages of the member states ’ 1990 ghg emissions . further , it assumes that wind power displaces the average eu amount of co2 per kwh .

pure power – wind energy scenarios up to 2030

of the 133 mt co2 avoided by wind energy , 130 mt co2 is avoided in the eu-15 which has a separate obligation under the kyoto protocol ( -8 % compared to 1990 ghg emissions ) from the rest of the eu ( the new member states – excluding malta and cyprus which have no obligation – all have a reduction target of -8 % compared to 1990 ) . the wind power installed in the eu-15 by end 2010 reduces co2 emissions by 3 % of 1990 ghg emissions , equal to 38 % of the bloc ’ s kyoto obligation .

in 2007 , the european environment agency ( eea ) projected that the eu-15 would miss its kyoto target with 172 mt co2 equivalents . the avoided co2 emissions of 133 mt from wind power in 2010 will fill 77 % of that gap ( see table in annex 3 ) .

source : european commission draft proposal for a directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources

to meet the 20 % target for renewable energy , the european commission expects 34 % 11 of electricity to come from renewable energy sources by 2020 ( 43 % of electricity under a “ least cost ” scenario12 ) and believes that “ wind could contribute 12 % of eu electricity by 2020 ” . in 2007 , approx . 15 % of eu electricity demand is covered by renewables , including approx . 10 % large hydro and app . 3.5 % wind energy . excluding large hydropower , for which the realisable european potential has already been reached , the share of renewable electricity in the eu will need to grow fivefold , assuming that electricity demand does not increase , from approx . 5 % to 25 % to reach the electricity target . with increased demand , non-large hydropower renewable electricity will need to grow even more .

ewea maintains the target it set in 2003 of 180 gw by 2020 , including 35 gw offshore in its reference scenario . that would require the installation of 140 gw wind power capacity , including 34 gw offshore , in the 13-year period 2008-2020 . 16.4 gw of capacity is expected to be replaced in the period . the 180 gw would produce 477 twh of electricity in 2020 , equal to between 11.6 % and 14.3 % of eu electricity consumption , depending on the development in demand for power . 28 % of the wind energy would be produced offshore in 2020 .

pure power – wind energy scenarios up to 2030

a precondition for reaching the ewea target of 180 gw is that the upcoming directive on renewable energy establishes stable and predictable frameworks in the member states for investors . much also depends on the european commission ’ s action plan on offshore wind energy ( scheduled for the second half of 2008 ) and a subsequent adoption of a european policy for offshore wind power in the eu . the 180 gw wind power capacity by end 2020 will avoid the emissions of 328 mt of co2 . according to the european commission ’ s proposed reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 , the 27 member states need to reduce emissions not covered by the emissions trading scheme ( ets ) by 10 % to 2,668 mt co2 equivalents in 2020. the target implies a reduction in total emissions for the eu-27 of 296 mt co2 equivalents . consequently , by 2020 wind power will avoid emissions equal to 110 % of the reduction required by member states for emissions outside the ets . according to the european commission ’ s proposed reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 , the sectors covered by the ets must reduce emissions by 21 % compared to the 2005 level to 1,720 mt co2 equivalents in 2020. the target implies a reduction in total emissions for the sectors covered by the ets of 457 mt co2 equivalents . wind energy will avoid emissions equivalent to 71 % of the ets target . in total , eu member states and the sectors covered by the ets must reduce their emissions by 753 mt co2 equivalents between 2005 and 2020. in 2020 , wind power will avoid emissions equal to 44 % of the combined target .

up to 2030

in the ewea reference scenario , 300 gw of wind power will be operating in the eu in 2030 , including 120 gw ( 40 % ) offshore wind power . 187 gw will be installed in the decade from 2021 to 2030. of this , 67 gw will be needed to replace decommissioned capacity , predominantly onshore . onshore represents 54 % ( 101 gw ) of the installed capacity in the decade and the onshore market remains larger than the offshore market throughout the period , although the gap narrows towards the end of the period . by 2030 , the annual onshore market will be 9.9 gw and the offshore market 9.6 gw , representing investments of €19 billion . in 2025 , the offshore market is expected to reach the size of the 2008 onshore market ( 8.5 gw ) . total installations in the period 2008 to 2030 will be 327 gw , made up of 207 gw onshore and 120 gw offshore . of this , 83 gw will come from the replacement of decommissioned onshore capacity . total investments between 2008 and 2030 will be €339 billion . by 2030 , wind energy will produce 935 twh of electricity , half of it from offshore wind power , and cover between 21 % and 28 % of eu electricity demand , depending on future power consumption .

8. scenario

for wind power ’ s share of household electricity demand

the wind power production derived from the ewea scenarios can be expressed in relation to household electricity consumption . household consumption is expected to increase from 790 twh in 2006 to 1,114 twh in 203013. by 2030 some 25 % of total electricity demand will be consumed by households . other sectors that consume electricity include industry , agriculture , public and private services . while the total eu population is estimated to remain relatively stable , the number of households will increase by 35 million , or 18 % , indicating a reduction in the average household size . the average household consumption , nevertheless , will increase by 20 % over the next 25 years , from 3,995 kwh per year in 2006 to 4,787 kwh in 2030. the wind power capacity installed by the end of 2007 will produce 119 twh in an average wind year , equivalent to the electricity needs of 25 million average eu households . if the ewea reference scenario is reached , wind power will produce electricity equivalent to the needs of 43 million households in 2010 ; 107 million households in 2020 ; and 195 million eu households in 2030. wind power will produce electricity equivalent to the consumption of 84 % of the eu ’ s 233 million households in 2030 ( see table below ) .

of wind power to electricity generation

european electricity generation is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 1.9 % between 2000 and 2010 , 1.5 % in the decade 2010-2020 and 0.9 % in the decade up to 203014. the 56.5 gw of installed wind power capacity in the eu-27 by the end of 2007 will , in an average wind year , produce 119 twh of electricity equal to 3.7 % of eu electricity demand ( 3,243 twh15 ) . if the reference scenario is reached , wind power production will increase to 177 twh in 2010 , 477 twh in 2020 and 935 twh in 2030. the european commission ’ s baseline scenario16 assumes an increase in electricity demand of 31 % between 2005 and 2030 ( 4,367 twh ) . assuming that eu electricity demand develops as projected by the european commission , wind power ’ s share of eu electricity consumption will reach 5 % in 2010 , 11.6 % in 2020 and 20.8 % in 2030. if political ambitions to increase energy efficiency are fulfilled , wind power ’ s share of future electricity demand will be greater than the baseline scenario . in 2006 , the european commission released new scenarios to 2030 on energy efficiency and renewables17 . if eu electricity demand develops as projected in the european commission ’ s “ combined high renewables and efficiency case ” , wind energy ’ s share of electricity demand will reach 5.3 % in 2010 , 14.3 % in 2020 and 28.2 % in 2030 .

10. contribution

of wind power to electricity generation capacity

the iea18 expects 5,087 gw of electricity generating capacity to be installed worldwide in the period 2005-2030 , requiring investments of $ 5.2 trillion in generation , $ 1.8 trillion in transmission grids and $ 4.2 trillion in distribution grids . for the european union , the iea expects 862 gw to be built , requiring investments of $ 925 billion in new generation , $ 137 billion in transmission and $ 429 billion in distribution grids . as already mentioned , wind power ’ s contribution to new power capacity in the eu has been exceeded only by gas in the last decade . 30 % of all installed capacity was wind power in the period 2000 to 2007 . 55 % was natural gas and 6 % was based on coal . spare electricity generating capacity is at a historic low and phase-out policies in the eu member states require 27 gw of nuclear plants to be retired . europe has to invest in new capacity to replace ageing plant and meet future demand . between 2005 and 2030 , a total of 862 gw of new generating capacity needs to be built , according to the iea – 414 gw to replace aging power plants and an additional 448 gw to meet the growing power demand . the capacity required exceeds the total capacity operating in europe in 2005 ( 744 gw ) . as previously stated , the iea is less optimistic about the development of wind energy than ewea . hence , it is necessary to adjust the iea figures for total generating capacity and new capacity to take account of the fact that wind energy ’ s capacity factor is lower than that of the average coal , gas or oil plant . adjusting for the capacity factor adds 18 gw to total generating capacity in 2030 for a total of 1,176 gw and 26 gw to the figure for new generating capacity between 2005 and 2030 for a total of 889 gw over the period . in 2005 , 5.4 % of all capacity in the eu was wind energy . that share is forecasted to increase to 9.9 % in 2010 , 18.1 % in 2020 and 25.5 % in 2030. wind power ’ s share of new generating capacity is forecasted to be 34 % in the period 2005-2020 and 46 % in the decade leading up to 2030. wind power ’ s share of new capacity in europe in the 25-year period 2005-2030 is 39 % .

11. greenhouse

gas emissions in europe

in 1997 in kyoto the eu-15 made a commitment to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases ( ghg ) by 8 % by 2008-2012 compared to its 1990 level of emissions . the most important ghg by far is co2 , accounting for 83 % of total eu-25 emissions in 2004. a ‘ burden sharing ’ approach sets targets for each of the 15 member states . the new member states have individual reduction targets of 8 % except hungary and poland who must reduce by 6 % . cyprus and malta have no obligation . the overall kyoto reduction target for eu-25 ( excluding malta and cyprus ) is 7.8 % , or 450 mt of co2 equivalents . the eu-15 obligation is a reduction of 342 mt co2 equivalents . in 2005 , total ghg emissions in the eu-27 were 7.9 % below 1990. in december 2007 , the european environment agency ( eea ) projected that the eu-27 would remain approximately at 2005 levels in 2010. there is a noticeable difference between the eu-15 and the new member states in terms of meeting their targets . while ghg emissions in the new member states are expected to be 37 % below 1990 levels by 2010 , it is estimated that the eu-15 will have reduced its emissions by a mere 2 % by 2010 , assuming existing policies and measures . in other words , the new member states are making up for the poor performance of the eu-15 .

co2 reductions from wind power
there are different ways of calculating wind energy ’ s co2 avoidance and the results depends on the assumptions made about which fuels are displaced when wind electricity is produced . the energy mix and base load differs between member states , so ideally wind power ’ s avoided co2 emissions should be based on the energy mix at the intermediate load in each member state . here , it is assumed that wind energy avoids co2 at the intermediate load but at the average eu-27 generation . operating nuclear power is rather inflexible and can not easily be regulated up and down . hence , wind power does not displace operating nuclear production , except during scheduled and unscheduled nuclear shutdowns and if nuclear capacity is decommissioned . neither does wind energy replace hydropower because hydropower resembles a storage technology for electricity . electricity from hydro that is displaced when wind power is operating will be saved for production later but total production from hydro is constant over time . for the eu as a whole it is assumed that each kwh of wind power displaces a kwh defined by the energy mix of coal , oil and gas at the time of production . this approach underestimates wind energy ’ s co2 avoidance because wind energy in reality avoids the most expensive and co2 intense production rather than the average production mix . naturally , the eu energy mix will change during the period up to 2030. according to 2006 iea data , oil , gas and coal power stations produced 1,804 twh in 2005 and emitted 1,408 mt of co2 . consequently , one twh produced by wind energy saved 0.78 mt co2/twh . the same approach is applied to iea ’ s data for 2010 , 2015 and 2030 and a linear variation is assumed in the intermediate years . using this approach it is assumed that wind energy in 2030 , will avoid 0.72 mt co2/twh . in 2007 , wind energy avoided 91 mt of co2 . in ewea ’ s reference scenario , annual co2 avoided from wind energy will increase to 133 mt in 2010 , 328 mt in 2020 and 576 mt in 2030 .

pure power – wind energy scenarios up to 2030

the european commission ’ s 2006 reference scenario , as well as its energy efficiency and renewables scenarios assumes an emissions permit price of €5/t co2 . carbon has been trading up to €30/t in 2006 and was trading at €20/t in february 2008. ubs forecasts a 2008 eu allowance price of €25/mt co219 . fig . 11.1 shows the total annual co2 emissions avoided by wind energy for the years 2000 to 2030 and the value of the co2 allowances for different scenarios of future co2 allowance prices : • €5/t co2 throughout the period ( european commission ’ s assumption , 2006 ) • €25/t co2 throughout the period ( ubs forecasted 2008 allowance price ) • €25/t in 2008 , increasing linearly to €50/t in 2020 and €75/t in 2030. assuming the linear development in co2 allowance prices from €25/t in 2008 to €50/t in 2020 , co2 costs avoided due to wind energy will increase from €2 billion in 2007 to 16 billion in 2020 and €43 billion in 2030. it is important to note that the total co2 reductions from the 327 gw of wind power investments needed to reach ewea ’ s 2030 reference scenario greatly exceed the figures for the annual reductions illustrated in fig 11.1 because the turbines installed will deliver co2 reductions far beyond 2030. this topic will be dealt with in chapter 13 .

12. avoided

fuel costs

fuel is not required to produce wind power . when wind energy is produced , it saves significant amounts of fuel costs in the form of coal , gas and oil that would otherwise have been needed for power production . in addition to these avoided costs , the production of wind energy reduces demand for imported fuel ( and thereby the cost of fuel ) while reducing the rate of depletion of europe ’ s remaining fossil fuel reserves . naturally , the avoided fuel costs of wind energy depend on the assumptions made about future fuel prices . oil and gas prices are very closely linked , and coal also follows – to a lesser extent – the price of oil . both the iea and the european commission have for many years made predictions on future coal , gas and oil prices , and most governments base their energy policies on the iea ’ s fuel price scenarios . historically , the iea and european commission scenarios have been similar , and both institutions have been very consistent in underestimating the future fuel prices . 2008 started with the price of oil reaching a record $ 100 a barrel . the international energy agency ( iea ) , predicts that the oil price will fall to $ 57 in 2010. in 2004 , the iea predicted that oil would cost $ 22 a barrel in 2010 , $ 26 in 2020 and $ 29 in 2030 ( in year-2000 dollars ) . fig . 12.1 shows the latest oil price estimates from the european commission ( 2006 ) and the iea ( 2007 ) , and an alternative oil price scenario from ewea . as the figure shows , the european commission believes that the price of oil in 2010 will be approx . 50 % lower than today ( app . $ 90 in january 2008 ) while the iea estimates a drop in the price of oil to $ 55 three years from now . , both institutions believe that the price of oil in 2030 will be approx . $ 60 a barrel – 33 % lower than today . nobody can predict oil prices , but it should be a minimum requirement that the european commission and the iea include fuel price sensitivity analysis in their scenarios for the future development of the energy markets .

the fuel costs avoided due to wind energy production can be calculated on the basis of the european commission ’ s fuel price assumptions for coal , oil and gas up to 2030. as fig . 12.2 shows , wind energy avoided €3.9 billion of fuel costs in 2007 : €1.7 billion worth of gas ; €1.2 billion worth of coal ; €0.7 billion worth of oil and €0.3 billion worth of biomass / waste . in ewea ’ s reference scenario , wind energy will avoid costs of €4.4 billion in 2010 ; €12 billion in 2020 ; and €24 billion in 2030 , based on the european commission ’ s fuel price assumptions ( fig . 12.2 ) . similar results emerge from using the iea fuel price assumptions ( fig . 12.3 ) .

assuming fuel prices equivalent to $ 90 per barrel of oil , rather than the european commission ’ s assumptions fuel costs avoided due to wind would be €5 billion in 2007 ; €8.3 billion in 2010 ; €20.5 billion in 2020 ; and €34.6 billion in 2030 ( see fig . 12.4 ) . the calculations here are based on an €/ $ exchange rate of 0.6838 ( february 2008 ) . fluctuations in exchange rates can have a profound effect on the avoided fuel cost . had the €/ $ exchange rate been 1 , wind energy ’ s avoided fuel cost would have been €50.5 billion in 2030 instead of €34.6 billion . however , it could reasonably be argued that the price of oil would be lower if the us $ was stronger .

in ewea ’ s fuel price scenario – the oil price increases gradually to $ 120 in 2030 , and the relationship between oil , gas and coal remains unchanged from the commission ’ s scenario – wind energy would avoid fuel costs worth €9.2 billion in 2010 ; €24.6 billion in 2020 ; and €44.4 billion in 2030 ( see fig . 12.5 . )

energy investments up to 2030

one of the significant benefits of wind power is that the fuel is free . therefore , the total cost of producing wind energy throughout the 20 to 25-year lifetime of a wind turbine can be predicted with great certainty . neither the future prices of coal , oil or gas , nor the price of carbon , will significantly affect the cost of wind power production . in order to calculate the wind power investments needed to reach ewea ’ s reference scenario , it is necessary to make assumptions on the future development of the cost of installed wind power capacity . for some years , it has been assumed as a rule of thumb that installed wind power capacity cost approx . €1,000/kw . that is probably still a valid rule of thumb . however , since 2000 there have been quite large variations in the price ( not necessarily the cost ) of installing wind power capacity . in the period 2001 to 2004 , the global market for wind power capacity grew less than expected ( see page 15 ) and created a surplus in wind turbine production capacity . consequently , the price of wind power capacity went down dramatically – for some projects €700-800/kw . in the past three years – 2005 to 2007 – the global market for wind energy has increased by 30-40 % annually , and demand for wind turbines has surged , leading to increases in prices . the european commission , in its renewable energy roadmap20 , assumes that onshore wind energy cost €948/kw in 2007 ( in €2005 ) . it assumes that costs will drop to €826/kw in 2020 and €788/kw in 2030. that long term cost curve may still apply for a situation where there is a better balance between demand and supply for wind turbines than at the present time . fig . 13.1 shows the european commission ’ s assumptions on the development of onshore and offshore wind power capacity costs up to 2030. in addition , there are two curves that reflect the effect of the demand/supply on wind turbine prices in recent years . ewea assumes onshore wind energy prices of €1,300/kw in 2007 ( €2005 prices ) and offshore prices of €2,300/kw . the steep increase in offshore cost reflects the limited number of manufacturers in the offshore market , the current absence of economies of scale due to low market deployment and bottlenecks in the supply chain .

based on the ewea reference scenario for installed capacity up to 2030 and the ewea wind power capacity prices above , figure 13.2 shows the expected annual wind power investments from 2000 to 2030. the market is expected to be stable at around €10 billion/year up to 2015 , with a gradually increasing share of investments going to offshore . by 2020 , the annual market for wind power capacity will have grown to €17 billion annually with approximately half of investments going to offshore . by 2030 , annual wind energy investments in eu-27 will reach almost €20 billion with 60 % of investments offshore .

cumulative investments in wind energy over the three decades 2000 to 2030 will total €390 billion . between 2008 and 2030 in ewea ’ s reference scenario , approx . €340 billion will be invested in wind energy in the eu-27 – €31 billion in 2008-2010 ; €120 billion in the decade 2011-2020 ; and €188 billion in the decade 2021-2030. the iea ( 2006 ) expects that €925 billion of investment in electricity generating capacity will be needed for the period 2005 to 2030 in the eu . according to the ewea reference scenario , €367 billion – or 40 % – of that would be wind power investments .

energy investments and total avoided lifetime cost

so far , this report has looked at wind energy ’ s contribution to electricity , co2 reductions , avoided fuel cost , etc . from a perspective of total installed capacity by the end of each individual year . in this chapter a life-time approach is used , in order to determine how much co2 and fuel cost are avoided from wind power investments made in a given year over the entire life-time of the capacity . for example , chapter 12 demonstrated that the 300 gw of wind power capacity installed in the eu in 2030 will avoid the emission of 576 mt/co2 in 2030. what has not been taken into account so far in this report is that the wind energy capacity installed , e.g . the 19.5 gw that will be installed during the year 2030 , will continue to produce electricity , avoid co2 and fuel costs beyond 2030 – some co2 and fuel costs will be avoided right up to 2055. fig . 14.1 shows the total co2 costs and fuel costs avoided during the lifetime of the wind energy capacity installed for each of the years 2008-2030 , assuming a technical lifetime for onshore wind turbines of 20 years and for offshore wind turbines of 25 years . furthermore , it is assumed that wind energy avoids an average of 690 g co2/kwh produced ; that the average price of a co2 allowance is €25/t and that €42 million worth of fuel is avoided for each twh of wind power produced , equivalent to an oil price throughout the period of $ 90 per barrel . for example , the 8,554 mw of wind power capacity that was installed in the eu in 2007 had an investment value of €11.3 billion , will avoid co2 emissions worth €6.6 billion throughout its lifetime and fuel costs of €16 billion throughout its lifetime , assuming an average co2 price of €25/t and average fuel prices ( gas , coal and oil ) based on $ 90/barrel of oil . similarly , the €152 billion of investments in wind power between 2008 and 2020 will avoid €135 billion worth of co2 and €328 billion in fuel cost under the same assumptions . for the period up to 2030 , wind power investments of €339 billion will avoid €322 billion in co2 cost and €783 billion worth of fuel .

it is important to note that these calculations only compare the capital cost of wind energy to avoided co2 and fuel cost . the operation and maintenance cost ( low because the fuel is free ) has not been taken into account . in addition , it would be reasonable to assume that some components of the wind turbine would need replacing during their technical lifetime . this has not been taken into account either . the purpose is to compare the investment value in an individual year with the avoided fuel and co2 cost over the lifetime of the wind turbines .

52

pure power – wind energy scenarios up to 2030

as can be seen from fig . 14.2 , fig . 14.3 and the table below , changing the co2 and fuel price assumptions has a dramatic impact on the result . with low co2 prices ( €10/t ) and fuel prices ( equivalent of $ 50/barrel of oil ) throughout the period , the wind power investments over the next 23 years avoid €466 billion instead of €783 billion . with high prices for co2 ( €40/t ) and fuel ( equivalent to $ 120/barrel of oil ) wind power would avoid fuel and co2 costs equal to more than €1 trillion over the three decades from 2000 to 2030. the following table shows the different savings made depending on the price of oil ( per barrel ) and co2 ( per tonne ) .

short description of the wind power plant and its operation
purpose

the innova 150kw type wpp is a plant designed for the generation of electrical energy from wind as a renewable energy source . it is capable of grid formation and , thus able to work either in parallel to a public or private energy supply net or in stand-alone operation . the wpp can be operated as single plant or in connection with other grid-forming wpp 's or electrical generators . 3.2 type of construction

the innova 150kw type wpp as a gearless high-performance horizontal axle-type wind power plant with two-blade rotor and variable number of revolutions stands out by the following significant features regarding its type of construction : − state-of-the-art two-blade rotor , equipped with rotor blades which are optimized in performance and noise-minimized due to their profile , and with integrated lightning protection , − hydrostatic main drive with immediately reacting behaviour for performance limitiation , − uninterrupted , active , rotor-initiated lateral angle adjustment during the production process , − strict exclusion of positive force-transmitting elements in all sub-assemblies which are exposed to the wind , − variable number of rotor rotations controlled by the operation control system to optimize and limit the performance , − possibility of a plant start-up from standstill even upon extremely low temperatures with the rotor in idle run , − fully automatic operation on the basis of the operation control system , − automatic adaptation to the existing net and/or consumption situation by application of an intelligent performance control system ( ipc : intelligent power control ) , − integrated diagnosis , resource and performance control system as an integral part of the operation control system , − remote monitoring and remote opration from one or more mobile or stationary posts .

type of operation

the electrical energy produced by the wpp can either be used for partial or complete satisfaction of the operator 's own energy need , or can be fed , completely or partially , into an existing net . the wpp is operated automatically by an operation control system . the relatively high plant performance regarding the given rotor diameter is determined by the designs of the components . in order to achieve this high rated performance at a reasonable wind speed , the advantages of an infinite variability of the revolutions are utilized . however , the relatively high revolving speed of the blade tips within the rated performance range causes a higher noise level . such noise is generally absorbed by the environmental sounds occurring in connection with the nominal wind speed anyways , and will not be noticable separately . in cases where such noise can not be tolerated due to the fact that the wpp is located in close neighborhood to residential areas , it is possible to reduce the the number of revolutions . in such a case , the wpp reaches its rated performance at higher wind speeds but runs at a `` whispering '' level which makes up for the yield losses . the variants a , b and c reflect the different modes of operation , with a representing operation with the highest and c with the lowest thinkable number of revolutions . variant b represents a randomly chosen mode between both extremes . the appropriate mode of operation is determined before the plant is put into operation , namely by setting the respective parameters in the operation control software in the computer . for the operator , it is possible to change these settings at any time within the range between both extremes a and c. the safety of the wpp is constantly monitored by the safety system . all functions relevant for safety are of a fail-safe design . local manual operation is possible . a remote system ensures monitoring of the wpp from a stationary or mobile operation center . also from there , unrestricted manual operation is possible . in the event of errors , the wpp remedies them independently to the extent it is capable of . temporary errors , such as mains failures which lead to a shut-down of the plant , are analyzed and documented by the wpp and reported to the control center . after remedy of the error the wpp re-starts operation automatically . the same procedure is followed in the event of permanent errors or in case the safety system has responded . an automatic re-start , however , is not performed in such cases . 3.4 general description of the wind power plant

in the first step , the rotor of the wpp converts the kinetic energy of the moving air mass into mechanical energy . this energy is directly transported to a hydraulic pump which converts it into hydraulic fluid energy . after conversion into fluid energy , a hydraulic motor re-converts the energy into driving mechanical energy , which is finally converted into electrical energy by the electrical generator . in order to adapt the aerodynamic properties of the rotor to the individual modes of operation in an optimal manner , especially with regard to the given wind speed , the wpp operates with variable

numbers of revolutions . since there is no positive force transmission between rotor and generator , the constant speed of the generator is independent of the rotor speed , which is necessary for grid formation or grid feeding . consequently , the generator can be connected to the grid or to the consumers directly . the selected generator type is a state-of-the-art brushless synchronous machine with integrated energizing system . during the production process , the rotor of the wpp is located on the weather side of the tower , namely windward . the rotor blades of the wpp are firmly screwed together with the hub and are not adjustable around its longitudinal axis . this is why adjustment of the aerodynamic rotor efficiency for performance regulation and limitation is done via regulation of the rotor speed exclusively . within the derated load range , meaning below the rated performance , the rotor speed is adjusted such that the rotor is constantly running with optimal aerodynamic efficiency . this is done depending on the wind speed which acts on the rotor circle area in an integral manner . restrictions to the max . admissible speed are taken into account depending on the selected variant . within the rated load range , the rotor speed is adjusted such that the aerodynamic efficiency is reduced to the extent necessary for the limitation of the plant 's performance to the designed rated performance . adjustment of the specifically required rotor speed is done by braking processes , directly performed by the hydraulic system of the main drive . this part of the hydrostatic main drive is used as operating brake which is absolutely free from wear and reliable in its operation . the produced braking energy is fed directly into the hydraulic oil of the main drive and can be discharged without any problems . this ensures unlimited , safe and reliable adjustment of the rotor speed even in cases when the countermoment for the rotor is only small due to low consumption by the generator . this can occur especially in stand-alone operation of the wpp and can not be controlled only through adjustment of the number of revolutions . the machine set is located in a rotary manner in the machine pod on top of the steel-tube tower . the electrical energy is transported from the machine pod , which is that part of the plant rotary in a lateral angle , into the tower , as a firm part of the plant , via tow cables . their twist is reliably checked by the operation control system of the wpp . both control and electro-technical installation are arranged in the tower bottom part where they are protected against the weather . control of all operational processes of the plant and monitoring of the various safety functions are performed from there in a fully automatic manner . remote operation and remote monitoring of the wpp are possible from one or more operating posts , provided the necessary means for data transmission are available there . 3.5 3.5.1 design of the main components rotor

the rotor of the wpp is a two-blade rotor . it consists of two rotor blades which are offset to each other by 180° , the rigid rotor hub and the rotor support which connects the rotor with the machine support and the hydraulic pump .

3.5.1.1 rotor blades the rotor blades are made of glass fibre-reinforced plastic , namely polyester . the plastic body of the rotor blade terminates in a cast-iron blade flange to which it is glued and additionally secured by bolts . the rotor blade is firmly screwed together with the rotor hub by means of that blade flange . the blades terminate in removable end caps made of refined steel which are required for effective protection against lightning . these end caps are connected to the blade flange via a copper cable in a conducting manner . 3.5.1.2 rotor hub the rotor hub has the function to connect the two rotor blades with each other , and both blades with the rotor bearing . an appropriately machined weld construction made of sheet steel serves as rotor hub . it is planned for a later point in time to apply a grey-cast iron part . the rotor hub is furnished with closable inspection openings at the front and sides . 3.5.1.3 rotor support the rotor support connects the rotor with the hydraulic pump and the machine support . the support is a concentric two-row four-point support of the necessary dimensions , capable to safely absorb the produced axial and radial forces and to transmit the torques initiated by the rotor to the hydraulic pump of the main drive . the outer ring of the rotor support is firmly screwed together with the front part of the machine support which is shaped appropriately for this purpose . the inner ring bears the drive shaft for the hydraulic pump , which is a flange shaft with multiple-wedge profile , as well as the hub itself . 3.5.2 machine support

the machine support carries all essential plant components . it is placed on the tower head in a rotary manner . its design is a machined , hot-galvanized weld construction made of sheet steel , of the required thickness and quality . 3.5.3 main drive

the main drive is a gearless hydrostatic drive which , by nature , is a fluidic transmission of the socalled retransmitting type . it consists of the hydraulic pump , the hydraulic motor and the hydraulic system with oil tank , oil piping , valves , pressure store and accessories . the hydrostatic drive enables complete exclusion of the more or less rigid , positive connection between rotor and electrical generator , typical with conventional wpp 's . this is one of the most important requisites for the immediately reactive behaviour of the wpp towards the wind and for the required capability of the wpp to form grids . due to the lack of a positive connection between rotor and generator in the drive flux of the wpp , the rotor , on one hand , can be operated exactly at the speed which , in relation to the given wind speed , ensures the best thinkable aerodynamic efficiency of the rotor in the derated load range and the necessary reduction of the aerodynamic efficiency in the rated load range . on the other hand ,

the generator , independent of the rotor speed , can revolve at the speed required by the grid and/or the consumers . performance limitation of the wpp is possible by means of purposeful control of the rotor 's number of revolutions . the process to this effect is extremely reliable , plant-saving and nearly independent of external influences , the application of which was not possible in connection with conventional plant technologies . this type of performance regulation allows the abandonment of mechanical adjustment of the rotor blades around their longitudinal axle ( pitch ) and facilitates the manufacture of the wpp drastically . valves , appropriately arranged in the hydraulic system of the main drive , enable purposeful control of the oil volume flow such that the desired rotor speed can be set exactly even in the rated performance range at any time . as a special feature , the hydrostatic drive is able to brake the rotor directly and in a nearly wearless manner , should this become necessary during operation . the kinetic energy of the rotor which is converted in this process , is transmitted into the hydraulic oil as thermal energy and can be either discharged without any problems due to the high , volume-related thermal capacity of the entire hydraulic system , or provided as available heat . the hydrostatic main drive itself serves as operating brake for the rotor , if controlled appropriately , and thus substitutes the pitch system as conventional aerodynamic brake . it is characteristic for the immediately reactive behaviour of the wpp towards the wind that it evades overloads resulting from gusts , which act on the rotor suddenly and briefly , in a nearly undelayed manner . further , the rotor is braked immediately which reduces its aerodynamic efficiency to the required extent . consequently , almost all energy contained in the entire gust is avoided and can not damage the wpp at all . the braking process itself is executed by the hydrostatic main drive in a wearless manner . the braking energy is transmitted into the hydraulic oil and discharged without any problems .

3.5.3.1 hydraulic pump the hydraulic pump is a slowly running radial piston pump . it has been selected from an entire series of available pumps regarding speed and torque as optimally as possible to exactly comply with the speed/torque characteristics of the rotor at optimal efficiency of the pump . the case of the hydraulic pump and the machine support are screwed together firmly . the pump shaft is a hollow multiple-wedge shaft which is connected with the rotor hub and thus with the driving rotor by means of a flange shaft . this way of connecting the hydraulic pump to the rotor ensures that the pump shaft and its bearings are not exposed to any moments and/or axial or radial forces , which may damage the bearings in the long run , except to those torques which are to be transmitted and converted . 3.5.3.2 emergency brake an emergency brake is firmly connected with the hydraulic pump . it has a compact design and is a multi disk-type brake . in the case of need , the emergency brake is used as emergency and holding brake for the rotor . it constitutes , as per requirement , the second brake system which is mainly used by the safety system . the operation control system uses this brake only to put the rotor in the final position for regular braking . 3.5.3.3 hydraulic motor the hydraulic motor re-converts the flow energy of the hydraulic oil into mechanical energy which drives the electrical generator . an adjustable motor of an axial piston design is applied as hydraulic motor . the adjusting device necessary to control the volume flow is firmly connected with the hydraulic motor . hydraulic motor and electrical generator form a constructional unit . to this effect , the case of the hydraulic motor and the case of the electrical generator are firmly connected with each other by means of a motor support and a relating damping ring for body sound decoupling . the shafts of hydraulic motor and electrical generator are connected by an elastic coupling . the entire motor/generator unit is suspended below the machine support by means of another damping ring , thus reaching into the tower from above . 3.5.3.4 hydraulic system the hydraulic system of the main drive comprises all components necessary to ensure its proper performance . these components are the tank , the line system , a pressure store and the appropriate valves and fittings to enable control of the hydrostatic drive by the operation control system and the safety system .

when designing the hydraulic system , special attention has been paid to the absolute tightness of all connections and a complete return of leak oil to the tank . the selected designs of all fittings and components comply with these requirements . moreover , application of biologically decomposable hydraulic oil brands has been ensured . seals and hoses have been selected accordingly . 3.5.4 electrical generator

the electrical generator converts the mechanical drive energy of the hydraulic motor into electrical energy . a brushless rotary current synchronous motor with a rotating energizing system is applied . energizing of the generator is controlled by the operation control system during the production process in compliance with the purpose . the same applies when asynchronizing it to an existing power grid and/or to other wpp 's or electrical generators . during the production process the generator works at a fixed speed . this is done completely independently of the speed of the rotor of the wpp . the required control of the hydraulic motor to this effect , depending on the volume flow , is performed automatically by the operation control system . 3.5.5 lateral angle system

the lateral angle system consists of the tower head bearing , the brake disk , the lateral angle adjusting device and the lateral angle brake . the lateral angle system of the wpp has the function to place the rotor at right angles to the respective wind direction as exactly as possible . to this effect , the entire machine pod is rotated in the tower head bearing by means of the lateral angle adjusting device . the lateral angle adjusting device and the lateral angle brake serve to fix the rotor in its optimally aligned position before the wind . the problem of alignment of the rotor before the wind constitutes one of the most difficult problems of the wind energy technology and has been solved by conventional plant technologies only in a preliminary and poor manner . with the two-blade rotor , however , an optimal solution has become possible . when rotating and exposed to an angular airflow , the two-blade rotor , in contrast , for example , to the three-blade rotor , develops yawing moments rotating in a sine-shaped manner . this means that , with the rotor rotating and depending on the given rotor position , both leeward and windward yawing moments act on the tower head . this would lead to a continuous swivel movement of the machine pod around its zero position before the wind when the rotor is exposed to a horizontal angular airflow . however , the rotor is secured against such swivel movements : the yawing moments do not occur when the rotor is exposed to an exactly right-angles airflow , and the machine pod will remain in its optimal position even if the lateral angle brake is bled . the problem would be solved in an optimal manner , if it was possible to make use of these rotorinitiated moments , especially of the windward ones , to adjust the rotor 's lateral angle in a plant saving way , meaning to practically take advantage of the angular airflow itself which acts on the entire rotor blade in an integral way , and not , as is the case with conventional wpp 's , to rely on the

information taken from a wind vane fluttering before the wind without orientation . it is exactly this kind of solution which has been put into practice with our wpp . in contrast to conventional technologies , positive force transmission has been excluded at all both in the lateral angle brake and in the lateral angle adjusting device . this is why the usual toothing of the tower head flange , in which one or more driving pinions of geared motors engage , is absent in our wpp . the lateral angle brake is a spring-operated , hydraulically bled-type brake . its function is to hold the machine pod and thus the rotor in a specified angle over any period of time . the lateral angle adjusting device consists of a hydraulically operated brake caliber , two hydraulic cylinders , which are firmly connected with the machine support and between which the brake caliber is mounted , and a device which enables specified shifting of the brake caliber relative to the machine support . it ensures that the machine pod and the rotor are always in an optimal position before the wind during operation of the wpp . when the wpp is in operation , the optimally aligned rotor is held only by the lateral angle adjusting device , while the lateral angle brake is bled . the yawing moments initiated by the rotor when exposed to a horizontal angular airflow , cause cyclic pressure fluctuations in the hydraulic system of the lateral angle adjusting device . the hydraulic system itself interprets such pressure fluctuations and performs a continuous adjustment of the cylinders for an optimal alignment of the rotor before the wind as long as such pressure fluctuations occur and/or exceed a certain value . if the lateral airflow and thus the initiated yawing moments and the differential pressure in the system exceed a certain admissible value , a pressure relief valve , which controls the windward position , opens automatically which causes the rotor to turn windward by its own yawing moment . in the case that the load on the wpp is getting too high due to an excessive lateral gust the rotor is relieved by a horizontal turn out of the wind . to this effect , a pressure relief valve , which controls the leeward position , opens automatically if the highest admissible pressure in the system is exceeded . this enables the rotor to escape from such an overload by an automatic turn out of the wind . the lateral angle adjusting device allows a lateral turn of the machine pod out of its central position by ±6.0° and/or from final position to final position by 12.0° . for larger lateral angles , the lateral angle adjusting device has to make up , which is done in interaction with the lateral angle brake : the brake holds the machine pod in its position during the make-up process . the machine pod can be turned by any lateral angle by repeated making up . this is done , on one hand , prior to the start-up of the wpp out of the standstill to align the motor preliminarily on the basis of the data taken from the wind direction measuring device , and , on the other hand , if cable untwisting is required . at wind speeds beyond the nominal wind speed , at which the rated performance of the wpp is achieved safely even upon a lateral airflow , alignment of the pod depending on the wind direction is done just to a limited extent .

if securing against storm is required , the machine pod is held in its position safely by both the lateral angle adjusting device and the lateral angle brake .

3.5.6

tower and foundation

the tower is a conical two-section steel construction . both tower sections are screwed together at the building site by means of internal flanges . the static design of the tower is such that it can be erected together with the machine pod by means of a lifting device . to this effect , the tower is placed in a hinge during installation which connects tower and foundation safely for erection . a safety ladder is fixed at the outside of the tower which provides access to the pod for service and maintenance . likewise , there is a ladder installed inside the tower reaching up to the connection flange , allowing for the regular checks of the flange connection . the foundation below the wpp tower is a flat standard type . the tower is attached to the foundation section , and the forces and moments are transmitted into the foundation via this section which is integrated in the steel-reinforced foundation . 3.5.7 grid formation

there is a platform arranged at the bottom of the tower on which the low-voltage installation is arranged . it comprises all necessary switchgear and devices required to connect the wpp to the grid and/or the consumers . the switchgear is arranged in sheet steel cabinets which are vented and heated to prevent the formation of sweat or condensed water . the protection class of the cabinets is in accordance with the climatic conditions in the place of application . the low-voltage switchgear is controlled by the operation control system of the wpp ; the computer itself with all its components is arranged in the switchgear system . the electrical energy is dissipated via earth cables which lead into the ground through appropriate cable pipes in the foundation . the same cable pipes are used to lead the required control , signal and other communication lines necessary for the operation of the wpp to the outside . 3.5.8 hood

all components of the machine pod are embraced by a hood and are protected by the same against weather inclemency . the design of the hood complies with the requirements resulting from the specific climatic and other environmental conditions in the place of erection of the wpp , thus enabling the hood to fulfil its protective function . the hood is made of glass fibre-reinforced plastic and consists of two parts . the lower part of the hood is firmly connected with the machine support and turns around the tower head together with

safety and operation control concept
general

the safety and operation control concept of the wpp is an essential and basic part of the plant concept . it has been developed and designed together with all other components of the wpp . the design data determined by the safety and operation control concept have been taken as the basis for the calculation of the load cases of the wpp . consequently , the design data used in the assumed load cases either correspond to the data of the safety and operation control system or have been set up in a conservative manner . a complete description of the safety and operation control concept can be taken from the document `` high-performance wind power plant innova 150kw , operation control and safety conception '' , document no . 2.22.4-00.05.00-011 .

in the present document , explanations are only given to the extent necessary for a basic understanding of the principal function . 4.1.1 operation and operation control system

by operation control , we generally understand a procedure designed on the basis of the specific design data of the wpp , which allows for the effective and safe operation of the wpp as troublefree as possible and exposed to as little load as possible . operation of the wpp is controlled by an operation control system based on a decentral control concept . fibreoptic cables are used as transmission medium for the serial signals of the system between tower bottom and pod . the operation control system is designed to control , regulate and monitor the wpp . it ensures operation of the wpp under all thinkable inner and outer conditions in the standard range of operation . 4.1.2 safety concept and safety system

the safety system serves to secure the plant 's behaviour stipulated in the safety concept , in the case of malfunctions . it ensures a safe state of the wpp even in case of malfunctions under all thinkable inner and outer conditions . the safety system precedes the operation control system logically . it reacts after safety-relevant limits have been exceeded or if the operation control system is not or no longer able to keep the wpp within the standard range of operation , and thus also upon a complete failure of the operation control system . the operation control system on its part is able to activate the safety system a priori in case it is no langer able to ensure operation of the wpp under all thinkable inner and outer conditions within

the standard range of operation , if it recognizes this state and is still able to activate the safety system . 4.2 production process

the production process comprises that part of operation of the wpp in which electrical energy beyond the wpp 's own need is generated and fed into the grid or to the consumers . generally , this happens in the wind speed range of 2.0 ms-1 to 25.0 ms-1 at hub height . this working range is reasonably subdivided into derated load range and rated load range since the wpp behaves differently in each of these two sub-ranges . 4.2.1 production in the derated load range

in the derated load range , the wpp operates below its rating . in this sub-range , the control has to ensure that the wpp produces energy at the best thinkable degree of efficiency . this is done first of all by variation of the rotor speed according to the respective wind speed and by constant optimal alignment of the rotor within the lateral angle . 4.2.2 production in the rated load range

in the rated load range , the wpp has to reduce its aerodynamic efficiency at a wind speed of 12.5 ms-1 to 25.0 ms-1 at hub height . this is done by a defined reduction of the rotor speed . the controller of the rotor speed reacts directly , immediately and undelayed to the respective wind speed . alignment of the rotor within the lateral angle is done in a more restrained manner than in the derated load range as long as the rated output is achieved even upon lateral airflow and this lateral airflow does not cause inadmissable load to the wpp . 4.2.3 shut-down of the wpp

regular shut-down of the wpp from production is done if - the energy amount available from the wind is smaller than the minimum energy amount necessary for economic operation of the wpp . except where minimum supply to the consumers is preferred , neglecting the costs . - the wind speed at hub height exceeds a wind speed of 25.0 ms-1 , which is the threshold value for a shut-down . - the operation control system performs the shut-down due to a defect/error , load relief or other irregularities in the operation of the wpp . regular shut-down of the wpp is done by regulating the generator down through a controlled reduction of the rotor speed up to its complete standstill and disconnecting it from the grid subsequently . if the plant needs to be secured against storm , or if it is expected that storm securing will become necessary , the rotor , upon shut-down , is to be put in the so-called final braking position , i. e. with the rotor blades in a horizontal position . in this position , the rotor is held by the emergency brake over an unlimited period of time .

if the wpp was switched off at ambient temperatures below 0°c due to low winds or a defect , it must be ensured for a subsequent re-start that the rotor can start in idle run , which means that it only has to overcome the frictional moments of rotor bearing and hydraulic pump support . to this effect , the pistons of the hydraulic pump are to be pressed into their rearmost stop positions during the last rotor revolution and held in this position . the entire hydraulic oil flows back into the tank automatically through opened valves , and the pump is empty . 4.3 4.3.1 operation control in special situations start-up upon extremely low temperatures

the wpp is designed for operation at ambient temperatures down to -400c . this is ensured through an appropriate design of all components , the use of adequate materials , and the use of synthetic biological oil brands in the hydraulic systems . if the wpp produces energy at extremely low ambient temperatures , there will hardly ever be problems due to the occurring heat loss . however , the situation will be more difficult if the wpp is switched off and cooled down , and its own temperature falls down to the extreme ambient values while in a standstill . for a start-up of the wpp in such a situation it is important to set the rotor in motion successfully . the smaller the counter moment against the rotor revolution , the easier this will be possible . this is the point at which the hydrostatic main drive becomes invaluably advantegous compared to conventional drives , as it allows for a start-up in idle run . to this effect , there is no feed pressure applied to the hydraulic pump , which was completely emptied upon shut-down , so that its pistons stay in the rearmost neutral position and can not be operated . only if the rotor is moving at the smallest speed , feed pressure is being built up very slowly by pre-heated oil . this pressure puts the pistons in their working position in a progressive manner . the increasing volume flow is used for a further heating-up of the steadily increasing oil amount until the system has reached the minimum temperature necessary for a regular connection of the wpp . 4.3.2 securing against storm

the wpp is secured against storm by placing the rotor in a horizontal position . in this position , the rotor blades do not overtop the machine pod and can not exert any forces , which would be augmented by leverage , on the tower head . the rotor blades are held in their horizontal position for storm securing purposes under all circumstances as long as storm securing is necessary . due to the applied type of emergency brake ( spring-operated , hydraulically bled ) this is possible over an unlimited period of time .

installation of the plant

installation of the plant will be possible without any cranes if there are sufficient personnel available for mounting . the one thing that is typical for the installation of the plant is that the tower , after pre-assembly , can be erected together with machine pod and rotor blades out of its horizontal position . regarding the statics , the resulting load on the tower has been included in the calculation as installation load case . a complete description of the installation of the plant is contained in the document `` high-performance wind power plant innova 150kw , instructions on plant installation '' , document no . 2.22.2-00.08.00-011. the tower segments are placed on blocks so as to lie on the ground . subsequently , the two segments are screwed together to one unit by means of an internal flange . afterwards , the tower is connected with the prepared foundation section , which should be in a set condition and ready to be loaded , by means of a hinge . then the machine pod , without the generator assembly , is screwed to the tower head such that the rotor hub points downwards . the blocks underneath the tower are to be arranged in a way which provides the necessary space for installation . afterwards , the two rotor blades are screwed together with the hub . in order to erect the tower and the pod , mounted on the ground in the described way , one or more pulling devices , for example , with a minimum pulling force of 1,000 kn are required . if the ground conditions are normal , this will equal two trucks/lorries loaded with 50 kn or more . upon erection , attention is to be paid to a constant , jerk-free pull . the use of a capstan device would be the ideal case . the hinge provided at the tower bottom is necessary for erection . it is removed after setting up and can be used again for further installations . after the tower has been set up , the generator assembly is lifted upwards inside the tower from down on the ground using a lifting device and , subsequently , connected with the machine support by screwing it to its bottom from below . at this stage , the conncetion cables are already connected with the generator and were lifted upwards together with it . installation of the wpp in the place of service is complete after the necessary pre-assembled hydraulic connections to the hydraulic motor and the electical connections have been established . now the wpp is ready to be started for trial operation .

maintenance

in favor of an economically reasonable plant concept , the wpp is designed such that , provided the prescribed maintenance intervals are observed and the design-owed scheduled preventive maintenance ( spm ) measures are performed , a minimum service life of 25 years in the place of reference according to the renewable energy act ( rea ) is most likely to be achieved . this service life can be further increased if , after ascertainment of state , a general overhaul is performed upon completion of the 25th year of the minimum service life . afterwards , the subsequent maintenance cycles and scheduled preventive maintenance measures have to be re-determined . the concept of scheduled preventive maintenance determines the design of the wpp from the outset . its components are , unlike with conventional wind energy technologies , no longer designed to last for the entire life time of the plant regarding their fatigue strength , but only for a period between two spm measures1 . this leads to a significant reduction of the investment costs at almost the same operating costs and enables the desired and required life time of the wpp to become reality indeed . in order to ensure that the operating costs of the plant do not increase or increase only slightly by the performance of spm , it has been secured by constructive measures that replacement of the individual components can be carried out by the maintenance personnel quickly , without problems and without any additional auxiliary means such as cranes or lifting devices . moreover , it has been ensured that the replaced components can be reconditioned at a reasonable price and reused as replacements , if possible1 . for maintenance and overhaul measures , no additional auxiliary means are required except those tools and auxiliaries available to the service technicians . 6.1 maintenance cycles

in the course of one year of opration , maintenance should be carried out twice . the range of works is such that two technicians will need 2 work days to perform . 6.2 scheduled preventive maintenance

in intervals of 5 years , starting 5 years after commissioning , one of the two yearly maintenance measures will be replaced by scheduled preventive maintenance . the range of works comprises , among others , replacement of the hydraulic pump , the main hydraulic system including all hose connections , and the generator unit with hydraulic motor , coupling and generator . the time between the scheduled preventive maintenance measures may be reduced or extended depending on the actual operating conditions . whether reduction or extension applies can be taken from the records of the diagnosis , resource and performance control system . this system constantly checks and registers the actual number of load changes and their amplitudes , from which the actual dissipation of resources is derived . depending on these conclusions , the time between two subsequent scheduled preventive maintenance measures can be either reduced or extended . however , the regular maintenance intervals are not affected by this .

unscheduled overhaul

unscheduled overhaul is performed after damages or inspections , for example after maintenance if defects were found , the remedy of which would exceed the range of standard maintenance works . generally , unscheduled overhaul will not become necessary considering the plant 's operation concept . however , they can not be excluded completely .

`` blaze near wind turbines may have rekindled '' see above report for initial fire `` wind farm clue to horrific 'corkscrew ' seal deaths '' experts probing the so-called 'corkscrew deaths ' of seals on britain 's east coast believe the building of a huge offshore wind farm could be to blame . the corpses of 50 seals with a clean 'corkscrew ' cut running from head to tail have been washed up over the past 18 months . now scientists investigating the riddle have linked it to the sheringham shoal wind farm , which is being built 12 miles off the norfolk coast . it is thought that the seals have fallen victim to boats with ducted propellers , which have a non-rotating nozzle . the propellers are surrounded by metal casing , which allows greater fuel efficiency for boats with heavy loads . the injuries are thought to occur when the mammals are sucked into the propeller and ejected at the other end , causing the tell-tale deep , smooth , spiral cut . death is caused by massive tissue damage and loss of blood . `` construction of garrett wind farm at a standstill '' work ordered to stop by state environmental officials following violations related to water runoff and soil erosion controls `` windmill tower separates from trailer in forreston '' a trailer containing a windmill tower had parted with the semi tractor pulling it and rolled over , blocking both lanes of highway route 26 for 6 hours . the driver was uninjured . `` part of blade breaks off from vestas v112 prototype '' a blade piece between 6m and 7m came off the blade . `` wansbeck general hospital to demolish broken turbine '' the turbine produced no electricity since 2007. a fault had developed on the tip of one of its blades , when its carbon fibre coating started to come loose . it was repaired , but the fault re-appeared later and the turbine was switched off . `` sailor drifts into wind turbines '' sailor who ran out of fuel in poor wind conditions was rescued by rnli as he ended in a restricted area , drifting toward wind turbines off the lincolnshire coast . `` two turbines caught fire in drôme '' two turbines 3km apart caught fire at rocheforten-valdaine . there had been a previous fire in december 2004. debris reported to be scattered over a large area though firemen controlled this .

title of report assessment of potential improvements in large-scale low wind speed technology assessment of potential improvements in large-scale low wind speed technology global windpower 2004 march 29 , 2004 10:40am – 12:00pm improvements in blade and low wind speed technology technical track joseph m. cohen princeton energy resources international 1700 rockville pike , suite 550 rockville , md 20852 jcohen @ perihq.com www.perihq.com abstract a probabilistic methodology is presented to examine technology advances in large-scale , low wind speed turbines over the next 10 years . the paper first presents a reference set of performance and capital and operating cost characteristics for wind plants , using a composite of leading-edge 2002 technology . it next defines a set of technology improvement opportunities ( tio ) that may lead to lower levelized cost of energy ( coe ) . a preliminary set of quantitative estimates of improvements to coe equation inputs ( e.g . , turbine cost , net annual energy ) are made for each tio . results are then presented from a probabilistic approach to evaluating coes for possible turbine technology configurations , or “ pathways , ” resulting from successful implementation of all possible combinations of those improvements . this approach captures the uncertainty of both r & d outcomes ( potential sizes of various improvements ) and the probability of achieving any improvement , ( r & d `` success '' ) , regardless of the improvement size . introduction the president ’ s management agenda requires that government organizations adopt and maintain a strong focus on achieving results , and not on just carrying out processes . the u.s. department of energy 's ( doe 's ) wind energy research program has responded to this requirement by developing a program planning tool that prioritizes program activities , and assesses their continuing contribution to the achievement of program goals . the program pursues this management agenda through two parallel activities . first , the program has an on-going technical assessment activity – to monitor the current status of wind technology and progress in achieving program cost goals , to evaluate that status within the context of the needs of the marketplace , and to identify technological pathways that will lead to wind ’ s successful competition in the marketplace . second , the program also uses a formal peer review process – to benefit from the guidance of industry and the research community , and to provide an outside view of the program . technical assessment and peer review provide inputs that the program management team considers in making decisions about strategic program directions and funding priorities . the program goal for low wind speed technology is to achieve 3 ¢/kwh in land-based class 4 wind sites ( 5.8 m/s at 10 m above ground ) and 5¢/kwh in class 4 shallow water offshore sites by 2012. at the core of the strategic planning framework is a wind technology pathways model developed by princeton energy resources international , llc , ( peri ) , under subcontract to the national renewable energy laboratory ( nrel ) . an important objective of the pathways model is to demonstrate that there are sufficient opportunities for wind technology to be improved , through program-sponsored r & d , such that the goals of the program can , in fact , be achieved . a second objective of the pathways model is to explore the implications of program success in meeting goals if a particular research project does not yield the expected technology improvement benefits . this paper represents the views of the author and does not necessarily state or reflect those of the united states government or any agency thereof . technology pathways analysis the technology pathways analysis can be described as a 5-step process , as shown in figure 1. the overall metric used by the program to set goals for technology improvements , and to track subsequent progress in r & d towards those goals , is the levelized cost of energy ( coe ) . cost levelization is the conversion of a stream of varying actual annual project costs to a stream of equal ( level ) annual costs that has the same present value as the present value of the actual cost stream . coe depends partly on values for annual energy capture , and wind plant initial capital cost and annual expenses , including operation and maintenance costs , sinking fund payments for periodic ( long-term ) replacements or major component overhauls , land lease payments , and other expenses such as taxes and insurance . calculation of coe also involves assumptions for several financial factors such as the cost of money , required investor rates of return , project debt-to-equity ratios and other lender requirements , the assumed project operational life , and the annual wind energy available at the site . while not included in the pathways analysis , federal and state incentives and the delivery point for electricity can also significantly affect the coe . a full discussion of the coe methodology and assumptions may be found in attachment c of the nrel low wind speed turbine ( lwst ) project solicitation , october 2001. figure 1. wind technology path analysis process coe in the pathways analysis is expressed in constant , january 2002 dollars . it is calculated for a 100 mw ( rated ) wind power plant , with an expected life of 30 years , and a class 4 wind resource ( assumes 5.8 m/sec at 10 meters above ground , a wind shear exponent of 0.14 , and a rayleigh distribution , i.e . , a weibull k factor = 2 ) using the following equation : coe = ( fcr x icc ) + aoe aep where : coe ( levelized cost of energy ( $ /kwh ) ( constant dollar ) fcr ( fixed charge rate ( constant dollar ) = ( 0.1158 ) icc ( initial capital cost ( overnight $ ) = [ turbine capital cost ( tcc ) + balance of station cost ( bos ) ] aep ( net annual energy production ( kwh/yr ) aoe ( annual operating expenses ( llc+ ( o & m + lrc ) aep llc ( land lease cost ( $ /kwh ) o & m ( after-tax , levelized o & m cost ( $ /yr multiplied by ( 1- tax rate = 0.60 ) lrc ( levelized major replacement and overhaul cost ( $ /yr ) the initial capital cost is an overnight cost , i.e . , it does not include construction financing , which typically adds between 50 $ /kw and 100 $ /kw . the fixed charge rate is the annual amount per dollar of initial capital cost needed to cover the capital cost , a return on debt and equity , and various other fixed charges . this rate is imputed from a hypothetical project , assuming generation company ( genco ) , or balance sheet , financing , modeled with peri 's fate2-p pro forma cash flow spreadsheet model . specifically , it includes construction financing , financing fees , return on debt and equity , depreciation , income tax , property tax and insurance . for the coe calculations , an imputed constant dollar fcr = 0.1158 was used . the 10-year section 45 renewable energy production tax credit is not included in the fixed charge rate . to allow tracking of technology advances absent from changes in financial parameters and other assumptions , the following are treated as the only input variables in the coe equation for the turbine pathways analysis ; all other inputs and assumptions are fixed : turbine capital cost ( tcc ) balance of station cost ( bos ) annual operation and maintenance cost ( o & m ) levelized replacement and overhaul cost ( lrc ) net annual energy production ( aep ) readers are cautioned that the coe calculated for this analysis is not the same value as the coe that would be calculated in the current market . first , commercial coes are stated in current dollars , which include the effects of inflation , making the commercial coe typically about 0.5 ¢/kwh to 1 ¢/kwh higher than the constant dollar equivalent . second , the federal production tax credit ( 1.8 ¢/kwh for the first 10 years ) is not included . third , the fcr assumes a relatively high required rate of return compared to current market rates and is therefore higher than one might use to characterize coe in the current financial climate . however , it is reasonable given historical experience , and consistent with the goal of this analysis - to track and project changes in coe resulting from technology development , not financial conditions . the reader is also cautioned that the levelized coeis not the same as a bid price , which might include escalators . step 1 - characterize reference turbine in order to project improvements in cost , performance , and reliability on wind turbine systems and wind plants using the pathways model , a baseline , or reference , set of cost and performance characteristics for the five variables listed above must first be developed . these characteristics serve as the inputs to a reference coe from which all technical improvements are measured . the reference technology characteristics for doe 's ongoing low wind speed technology pathways analysis efforts were derived primarily from the baseline turbine design developed under the recent windpact ( wind partnership for advanced component technologies ) project . [ 1 ] that baseline represented a composite of the most advanced wind energy technology available in 2002. nominally , it represents a 3-bladed , up-wind , variable pitch , variable speed turbine using a doubly-fed generator rated at 1,500 kw . the rotor diameter is 70 meters and the tower height is 65 meters . the reference characteristics are also consistent with several leading commercial turbines from the major manufacturers in 2002. that date was selected as the reference because it is when the doe low wind speed turbine program was initiated . because the purpose of the pathways analysis is to examine leading edge technology , it is important that the reference turbine represent the current status of such technology . the analysis characterizes costs assuming a 100 mw wind plant , to take advantage of economies of scale in procurement and installation . analysis of 22 confidential power purchase agreements for projects installed over the past 6 years shows a strong correlation between project size and capital cost . further , cost estimates assume favorable installation and maintenance conditions consistent with large areas of class 4 winds in the united states ( i.e . , relatively flat land , easy access , and soils conducive to foundations and large installation cranes ) . together , these assumptions create a capital cost estimate towards the lower end of the range typically reported for commercial projects . table 1 summarizes estimated input data for the reference wind coe calculation . data are shown as a range from minimum to maximum , with an expected value in-between . those three data points create a triangular distribution for each variable , as illustrated in figure 2. the wind pathways analysis model uses a monte carlo sampling approach to randomly sample , and then combine the resulting values from , each input distribution in the coe equation . the model performs this sampling exercise over a large number of iterations to create a distribution of all possible resulting values . using the inputs from table 1 , the model calculates a reference wind turbine project with a mean ( i.e . , 50 % chance ) coe of 4.7 ¢/kwh , or 4.8 ¢/kwh at a 65 % level of probability . step 2 - identify technology improvement opportunities ( tios ) as an initial test of the wind path analysis tool , national wind technology center ( nwtc ) research staff identified a set of technological improvements that are expected to contribute to the technology ’ s becoming more cost effective by 2012. these have been termed the technology improvement opportunities ( tio ) . wind turbine design is a matter of constant tradeoff between the competing demands of lower cost , greater energy productivity , increased lifetime and durability , and maintenance cost . achieving greater energy production may cost more , or it may cost less . reducing materials to reduce capital investment may adversely affect o & m costs . these are the designers ’ tradeoffs , and they are captured in the model . however , the model does not currently perform detailed system tradeoffs itself . it can include any number of independent technology design paths , but tradeoffs between components within a system must currently be treated in the estimation of the input parameters . a preliminary set of tios is listed in figure 3. table 1. reference ( 2002 ) wind turbine and plant characteristics figure 2. example coe input distributions figure 3. preliminary technology improvement opportunities tio 1. advanced ( enlarged ) rotors - some of the most dramatic reductions in cost of energy are expected to derive from sophisticated new rotor designs . in the near term , turbines will employ advanced control systems specifically developed to reduce structural loads . by this means , larger rotors can be mated to existing tower and chassis designs . ( in fact manufacturers have already begun to achieve this from their 2002 designs . ) the consequence of this approach is an appreciable increase in annual energy production ( aep ) on the order of 10 % , but with only a minimal increase in turbine capital cost ( tcc ) , on the order of 1 % . virtually none of these advanced concepts can evolve without concurrent advances in control strategy and implementation . for example , extendable rotors , where diameter varies with inflow conditions , use blade length as a control variable in addition to torque and rotor speed . adaptive or predictive control systems , perhaps using embedded sensors or micro-mechanical devices , may need to monitor several control inputs while simultaneously monitoring system health . from a better understanding of aeroelasticity , designers have devised ways to fabricate adaptive composite blades to reduce structural loads . new materials , such as carbon fiber or hybrid carbon/glass composites are likely to be applied . an integrated design process requiring the simultaneous optimization of performance , noise , controls , aeroelastics , and structural dynamics will allow these advanced rotors to materialize . a direct benefit is reduced structural weight , but the most promising implementation is increased energy capture through increased swept area . several recent reports sponsored by the doe wind enegy program contain information on potential improvements in rotors . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] tio 2. manufacturing - r & d in the area of manufacturing methods will enable designers to improve the performance-per-unit-cost of wind turbines . as new materials are part of tio 1 , moving towards blades that are both stiffer and stronger to span greater areas , and also lighter and adaptive to reduce system loads , will also require improved manufacturing processes . since blades control all of the energy capture and almost all of the loads , they are the primary target of materials , manufacturing , and fatigue research . tools that predict how materials work within design details will assist in improving the tailoring of design practices to take into account material interactions , property variability , and specified design loads . detailed designs of specific components will be better integrated into system codes for full structural dynamics and performance evaluation . in addition to the technology manufacturing and design improvements discussed above , there have been recent indications from several sources that manufacturer ’ s markup may be expected to decrease in the future . several factors may contribute to narrower margins , including lower uncertainty and risk with mature products . in addition , price pressure from competition and higher sales volume from larger , more expensive machines are expected to result in smaller margins . there have been many reports published by the program that support the potential for advances in this tio . some of these are listed in the reference section . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] tio 3. reduced energy losses and increased availability - in calculating coe , the energy converted by the rotor is multiplied by a factor to account for various energy losses . these losses are the result of blade soiling from dirt and insects , interference among turbines in arrays , imperfect controls for tracking the wind or maintaining rotor speed , and downtime from unexpected or unavoidable events . with improvements in design capability and operating experience , these losses are expected to decrease . in addition , advances in health monitoring techniques utilizing telemetry or other communications systems will allow problems to be diagnosed before costly repairs are necessary . improvements in extended scheduled maintenance will reduce costs for o & m trips , especially for offshore turbines . tio 4. advanced towers - in most locations , the wind speed increases with height above the ground according to a power law function . unfortunately , tower costs also rise with height , and do so exponentially . furthermore , the cost of cranes to install and service turbines on tall towers can become prohibitive . now that the design and installation of robust wind turbine towers are refined engineering disciplines , the awareness that significantly greater energy capture is the reward of taller towers has focused designers on innovative concepts to address these issues . technology that has been used for years on smokestacks and water towers , for example , is being evaluated for use on wind turbines . hybrid towers of tubular steel atop concrete bases are an option , as are self-erecting designs of several types . these concepts may be viewed as `` enabling '' technology for towers of 100 m and taller . reducing the cost of construction , installation , or the towers themselves permits the exploitation of more energetic winds with no increase in land or transmission costs . while taller towers entail increases in turbine capital cost ( tcc ) , the effect of this increased cost is more than offset by the expected increase in energy capture , even at moderate wind sites . furthermore , self-erecting towers will provide an appreciable , though currently inestimable , reduction in maintenance costs . recent windpact studies provide further information on possible advances in this area . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] tio 5. site-specific design/reduced design margin - most wind turbines are designed to international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) specifications for structural adequacy and system safety . the requirements depend upon site characteristics such as annual average wind speed and inflow turbulence . recent studies indicate that turbines designed for standard iec class definitions may be very far off optimum in some applications . this is particularly true for low wind speed sites , where varying levels of coe reductions are possible depending upon whether specific components are purpose-designed or there is a complete , special-purpose , system design . while it is not yet clear which projects warrant site-specific design , the approach is expected to be appropriate for some of the very large projects currently envisioned . in the current coe calculations , we characterize the wind site as having an annual average wind speed of 5.8 m/s measured at a height of 10 m above ground . wind speed is assumed to increase using a power law exponent applied to the ratio of hub height to the reference height . an exponent of 1/7 is often used for coe calculations . however , it is well known that there are many sites in the u.s. with more favorable wind shear characteristics . there are also sites with more favorable distributions of wind speed about the mean – they are skewed toward higher wind speeds . consequently , in addition to the benefits of specially designed wind turbines , deployment at these energetic wind sites will also expected to occur . to accommodate the somewhat greater fatigue loads associated with operation at higher mean wind speed , a modest increase in turbine capital cost may be expected . tio 6. new drive train concepts - several wind turbine design teams are evaluating promising new drive train concepts . many different approaches are proposed , including highly integrated systems , permanent magnet generators and multi-generator configurations . in some cases , the drive train also has a favorable impact on chassis and nacelle integration . the important common attribute of these disparate systems is the ability to reduce both initial drive train cost and long-term replacement cost by 20 % to 45 % . the anticipated coe increments include the effects of component efficiencies and of advanced power electronics appropriate for the particular drive train concept . the doe program has recently published a reports discussing potential advances in drive trains . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] tio 7. advanced power electronics - the january 2002 baseline is a variable speed turbine using a wound rotor generator with power conditioning of approximately 30 % of its output . future turbines are also expected to be variable speed designs . it is likely that some of them will employ direct-drive , permanent magnet generators , which enable elimination of conventional gearboxes by controlling shaft speed and torque electrically instead of mechanically . due to those control requirements , such turbines require power conditioning of 100 % of their output . in addition to the cost and efficiency improvements of the power electronics , additional cost reductions are expected in subsequent years . these will result from learning experience , as well as improved components and circuit design . tio 8. learning curve effects - an accepted phenomenon is that the cost of manufacturing products decreases with increased cumulative production volume . this learning effect results from better tooling and assembly procedures , value engineering , competition among suppliers , and general learning experience . it does not include technology advances from r & d or volume discounts from larger annual or bulk purchases . the rate of reduction is usually characterized by a `` learning rate , '' or percentage reduction in cost , for every doubling of cumulative capacity . a conservative approach to estimating cost reductions from learning is to assume a range of market growth rates ( say , one or two doublings of cumulative capacity by 2012 ) and a range of small decreases in the learning rate , based on the maturity of the wind technology product and industry , and historical experience with analogous products and industries . step 3. estimate tio effects the left side of figure 4 shows a range of preliminary estimates for improvements in coe inputs from the various tios . in the same way that reference coe inputs were developed using triangular distributions , nwct staff developed triangular distributions for coe improvements for each tio based on lwst proposals , windpact studies , research reports , and expert knowledge . ( note that turbine capital costs ( tcc ) and balance of station costs ( bos ) have been combined in the `` capital cost '' category in the figure . ) the bars on the figure show the minimum and maximum of the triangular distribution . if desired , the model can use other distributions to match special insights one might have on any of the input variables . the coe improvement estimates for each tio are currently undergoing extensive revision and new results are expected later this year . as such , figure 4 should be considered only illustrative of the technology pathway inputs and analysis results . it is only partially complete in terms of the numerical estimates , as well as the indications of which coe inputs are impacted by each tio . the left side of the figure also contains a column for `` probabilities of success '' that characterizes the chances that improvements of any size will be achieved in each tio . that is , the model first accounts for the probability that `` success '' is achieved , and if is , then the resulting improvements will fall within the range identified by data bars in the figure . the bars therefore reflect the inherent uncertainty in knowing the value of future improvements . figure 4. preliminary path analysis improvments and results step 4. perform analysis to illustrate how the model works in its simplest form , assume that there are only two tios . the first reduces capital cost by 10 % and also increases energy production by 5 % . the second , which is totally independent of the first , reduces cost by another 7 % , but produces 4 % less energy ( a cost-effective trade-off ) . simply adding the two together gives the outcome that cost is reduced by 17 % and energy production is increased by 1 % . because cost of energy is proportional to capital cost and inversely proportional to energy production , the coe reduction from these two tios would be ( 1-0.17 ) / ( 1+0.01 ) , or 17.8 % . in fact , the model represents the output range as a probability distribution around a most likely value , in the same way that it represents the inputs as probability ranges . the model can account for any potential interactions among the different tios . in contrast to the simple example just discussed , the model adds the potential changes probabilistically , and produces a range of potential outcomes for cost , energy production , and o & m . this probabilistic treatment is illustrated in figure 5. the model further accounts for the variety of technology configurations that might be used to achieve progress ( e.g . , through different gearbox designs ) . the model ’ s ability to analyze the variety of approaches to meeting goals is what makes it a true “ pathways ” model . to illustrate , all turbines require a tower and rotor ; but different tower designs could be married to different rotor designs , and still achieve the same level of cost-effectiveness . these combinations can be thought of as competing pathways . it is critical that the doe program be able to represent the fact that there are many potential approaches to meeting goals , that some are riskier than others , and that some might potentially yield a higher level of improvement in exchange for that additional technological risk . step 5. review results the right side of figure 4 shows the resulting ranges for coe input improvements ( top of graphic ) , and subsequent reduction of coe itself ( bottom of graphic ) . the figure shows that , while there is a very small chance that coe could be improved by as little as 20 % , or as much as 50 % , there is a 60 % chance that it will be improved by 37 % from the reference to a value of 3 ¢/kwh , i.e . , ( 4.8-3 ) /4.8 = 37 % . conclusions as part of the doe wind energy program 's overall program planning and management requirements , a methodology has been developed to assess the potential improvements to low wind speed turbine technology . the methodology accounts for both the probability of success of r & d efforts to achieve technology improvements , and the inherent uncertainty associated with the values of those improvements . reference turbine cost and performance characteristics , representing year 2002 leading-edge technology , were developed that result in a mean constant dollar levelized cost of energy of 4.7 ¢/kwh , or 4.8 ¢/kwh with a probability of 65 % . nwtc and sandia staff have developed a preliminary set of technology improvement opportunities ( tios ) that describe the areas for potential improvements to low wind speed turbine technology between 2002 and 2012. program researchers have also partially developed a preliminary list of improvements to coe inputs for each tio . using that set of improvement values in a test run , the wind technology path model resulted in a projection of a levelized cost of energy ( coe ) in year 2012 of 3 ¢/kwh at a 60 % level of probability . the wind program plans to conduct an update of the coe input improvement values for each tio as part of its annual program planning and assessment cycle during 2004. updated results , detailing both the sources for coe improvements and their corresponding values , will be reported from that activity . acknowledgements nwtc and sandia researchers contributing to this work include paul migliore , alan laxson , bob thresher , mike robinson , paul veers , scott schreck and patrick quinlan . tom schweizer at peri also provided technical assistance and review . references 1. malcolm , d.j . and a.c. hansen , “ windpact turbine rotor design study , ” june 2000 – june 2002 , prepared for the national renewable energy laboratory , nrel/sr-500-32495 , august 2002 . 2. griffin , d. , global energy concepts , evaluation of design concepts for adaptive wind turbine blades , sand2002-2424 , august 2002 . 3. proceedings of the wind turbine blade workshop , february 24-25 , 2004 , sponsored by sandia national laboratories , nrel , doe , http : //www.sandia.gov/renewable_energy/wind_energy/04presentations.htm . 4. sand 2002-3101 , `` blade manufacturing improvement project http : //www.sandia.gov/renewable_energy/wind_energy/choose023101.htm . 5. tpi composites , inc. innovative design approaches for large wind turbine blades , sand2003-0723 , march 2003 . 6. tpi composites , inc. , cost study for large wind turbine blades : windpact blade system design studies , sand2003-1428 , may 2003 . 7. sherwood , kent , foam matrix , inc. , blade manufacturing improvement project : final report , sand2002-3101 , october 2002 . 8. global energy concepts , llc .

1 1.0 introduction qualifications 1.1 my name is daniel shepherd . i hold a phd in psychoacoustics , a masters of science degree in psychology , a bachelor of science degree in psychology and biology , and a bachelor of arts degree in history and politics . my phd dissertation was a study on the abilities of human observers to discriminate between low level sounds . my masters thesis investigated a newly emerging paradigm in physics , stochastic resonance , and applied it to the processing of low level sounds in humans . 1.2 currently i am a senior lecturer ( above the bar ) at the auckland university of technology , lecturing in the areas of psychological assessment , biopsychology , and statistical analyses at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels . since 2005 i have undertaken substantial supervision of postgraduate students engaged in a range of psychological and health research , including psychoacoustical topics . at the university of auckland i am an honorary research fellow in the department of psychology , an associated staff member in the department of chemistry , and have a strong working relationship with members of the university of auckland ’ s school of audiology and school of population health . in 2008 i co-founded the world health organisations ’ quality of life ( whoqol ) field centre in new zealand . 1.3 i have published papers on the psychophysical measurement of human hearing abilities and have presented at numerous international conferences on the topic . in the past year i have accepted invitations from top-tiered psychoacoustic and health journals to peer review scientific manuscripts . 2.0 preamble 2.1 i have been invited by the ohariu preservation society to provide an evaluation of the impact of turbine noise on health and well-being . i have accepted this invitation and present findings from research projects i have personally initiated and undertaken in the last five years . i previously presented on their behalf at the original consent hearing in 2008. at this hearing i noted that the commissioners had not had time to read my statement prior to my arrival . i also indicated during this hearing that meridian energy should undertake a psychoacoustical survey of the ohariu valley in order to ascertain the prevalence of noise sensitive individuals and other vulnerable groups . 2.2 on more than one occasion i have visited the ohariu valley and familiarised myself with its layout and character . i have personally visited the makara valley on three occasions in the last year , and on one occasion had the opportunity to listen to the turbine noise . additionally , on numerous occasions i have heard the noise coming from turbines situated in the tararua ranges in the manawatu . current knowledge 2.3 wind turbines are a new source of community noise , and as such their effects on public health are only beginning to emerge in the literature . the recognition of a new disease , disorder , or threat to health usually follows a set pathway . first , doctors and practitioners attempt to fit symptoms into pre-defined diagnostic categories or to classify the complaints as psychosomatic . second , as evidence accumulates , case studies begin to appear in the literature , and exploratory research is undertaken to obtain better descriptions of the symptoms/complaints . third , intensive research is undertaken examining the distribution and prevalence of those reporting symptoms , the factors correlating with the distribution and prevalence of those symptoms , and ultimately to cause-and-effect explanations of why those reporting symptoms may be doing so . 2.4 in my reading of the literature the health effects of wind turbines are only beginning to be elucidated , and is caught somewhere between the first and second stages described in 2.3. the important point to note is that case studies ( e.g . , harry , 2007 ; pierpont , 2009 ) and correlational studies ( e.g . , pedersen et al . , 2007 ; van den berg , 2008 ) have already emerged in relation to the health effects of wind turbine noise , and so the possibility of detrimental health effects due to wind turbine noise must be taken with utmost seriousness . in this statement i present the results of a pilot study conducted in and around the makara valley that likewise urges a cautious approach to turbine placement . 2.5 finally , as with other noise sources there is individual variation in regards to the effects of wind turbine noise . however , it is a fallacy to argue that because only some suffer symptoms while others do not then those who claim to be suffering the symptoms must be making them up . in the field of epidemiology the differential susceptibility of individuals are known as risk factors , and assuming that individuals of a population can be represented by the average characteristics of the population is known as the ecological inference fallacy . in terms of wind turbine noise these risk factors are still under study , and one important risk factor is noise sensitivity . in assessing the health impact of turbine noise in the ohariu valley it is crucial that noise sensitive individuals be assessed in isolation and not ‘ averaged out ’ . scope of evidence 2.6 in this statement i focus on the health impacts of wind turbine noise , and i do not focus on issues outside of noise . thus references to cell phone or cell phone tower emissions or electromagnetic radiation from electricity transmission lines have no relevance to the current context , and should be discarded out of hand . these arguments constitutes a form analogy ( e.g . , weak or false analogy ) , which are not accepted as valid scientific critique . for example , a person confined to a room has no way of knowing whether they are being exposed to cell phone radiation but can easily detect the presence of an everyday sound . additionally , these examples of ‘ health scares ’ are not explained by plausible mechanisms , whereas there is a clear and proven link between noise , sleep , annoyance , and health impacts . 2.7 having considered the context i structure this statement as per figure 2.0 . 2.8 the terminus of the statement coincides with a summary section and a recommendation that consent should not be granted for this proposal . figure 2.0 : a schematic representation of the relationship between noise and health , as contextualised to turbines placed in life style areas . the numbers correspond to sections in this statement . arrows represent hypothesised or actual cause-and-effect relationships . the statement ends with concluding remarks . expert witness code of conduct i have received and read sections 5.1 to 5.4 of the environment court consolidated practise note 2006 headed expert witnesses - code of conduct . i understand all of the clauses contained within the code proper , and unconditionally agree to comply with it . 3.0 turbine noise and noise levels 3.1 level is that measure of sound which we associate with the perception of loudness . figure 3.0 demonstrates that , for equivalent noise levels , people judge wind turbine noise to be of greater annoyance than aircraft , road traffic , or railway noise . the most recent research to hand ( van den berg , 2008 ) has confirmed the relationship reported in figure 3.0 , and i have added van den berg ’ s data to the figure . figure 3.0 : annoyance plotted as a function of noise level for four theoretical models ( rail , road , air : miedema and oudshoorm , 2001 ; wind turbines : pedersen et al . , 2004 ) and four sets of data obtained from van der berg et al . , ( 2008 ) . for the data , closed symbols are for the entire sample , while open symbols are for those who identified that they had no economic interest . circles represent the percentage of “ very annoyed ” responses whilst squares represent the sum of “ very annoyed ” and “ rather annoyed ” responses . 3.2 the lack of equivalence evident in figure 3.0 is due to the unique characteristics of turbine noise , that is , clusters of turbines present a cumulative effect characterized by a dynamic or modulating sound as turbines synchronise . table 3.0 , which displays data i collected early this year to inform a subsequent noise study , displays annoyance ratings for the top ten rated annoying sounds out of 100 sounds played to a group of undergraduate students . sounds with an ( m ) indicate audio samples that could be described as periodic , and in that sense modulating . note that seven of the ten most annoying samples fall into this category , and that these results concur with those in the literature indicating that modulating sounds tend to be of higher annoyance . table 3.0 : mean annoyance ratings and standard deviations ( sd ) for ten audio files rating on a scale from 1 ( not annoying ) to 9 ( extremely annoying ) . annoyance rating sound mean sd girl yelling 8.08 0.99 fire alarm ( m ) 7.91 0.79 alarm ( m ) 7.83 1.33 dentist drill ( m ) 7.83 0.83 fire truck siren ( m ) 7.75 1.05 abuse 7.75 1.28 fire warning ( m ) 7.66 0.98 dial tone 7.66 0.98 jackhammer ( m ) 7.33 1.30 horns ( m ) 7.33 1.43 3.3 level is actually a very poor predictor of the human response to noise , and its role in health is commonly over-emphasised . for example , noise standards emphasise noise level as the primary factor in noise-induced health deficits , however , over 40 years of laboratory and epidemiological research has discredited this stimulus-orientated approach . for this reason noise standards promoting only noise level as the metric to assess health impacts should be approached with caution . that noise standards are not necessarily definitive is further demonstrated by the lack of agreement that can exist amongst experts on standards . the quarrelling surrounding the revision of the new zealand standard for acceptable wind turbine noise ( nzs6808 ) is testament to this ( see , for example , the september 2010 edition of the nz acoustical society journal , new zealand acoustics ) . 3.4 noise standards , even those advocated by the who in the past , are based on the dose-response curve . the dose-response curve plots noise annoyance as a function of noise level . users of a dose- response curve define a level of annoyance that they are willing to accept and then , either graphically or numerically , determines the level of noise that yields the predefined annoyance level . figure 3.1 illustrates an actual equation-based dose-response curve . figure 3.1 : a theoretical curve formulated to model the relationship between noise level and annoyance to aviation noise . figure 3.2 : percentage highly annoyed at aircraft noise plotted as a function of noise level . the solid curve is a portion of that presented in figure 3.1 , while the scattered points represent real measurements ( data from fidell , 2003 ) . 3.5 figure 3.2 is the same curve but with a shortened x -axis ( now from 57 to 68 db ) accompanied by actual measurements of noise annoyance from numerous studies reporting annoyance to aircraft noise . note the incompatibility of the theoretical curve ( solid curve ) and the empirically derived data ( data taken from fidell , 2003 ) . scrutiny of figure 3.2 reveals that annoyance reactions to noise vary substantially and do not appear to be correlated with noise level . other factors associated with the listener have been found to correlate with annoyance , and need to be accounted for when attempting to predict noise annoyance . it can be concluded that the high variability between individuals and groups makes it difficult to model the relationship between noise and annoyance . regrettably , plots such as the figure 3.1 above are still used to determine noise standards . 3.6 not withstanding the criticisms of dose-response relationships the who ( europe ) have attempted to categorise different bands of noise levels in relation to health impact , specifically sleep disturbance . they set out to establish a no observed effect level ( noel ) and a lowest observed adverse effect level ( loael ) for noise and various measures of health . the who ’ s ( 2009 : table 5.4 ) description of the relationship between noise level ( lnight , outside ) and health are repeated in table 3.2 : table 3 . 2 : who europe ( 2009 ) night time guidelines . 30 db although individual sensitivities and circumstances may differ , it appears that up to this level no substantial biological effects are observed . 30–40 db a number of effects on sleep are observed from this range : body movements , awakening , self-reported sleep disturbance , arousals . the intensity of the effect depends on the nature of the source and the number of events . vulnerable groups ( for example children , the chronically ill and the elderly ) are more susceptible . however , even in the worst cases the effects seem modest . lnight , outside of 40 db is equivalent to the lowest observed adverse effect level ( loael ) for night noise . 40–55 db adverse health effects are observed among the exposed population . many people have to adapt their lives to cope with the noise at night . vulnerable groups are more severely affected . > 55 db the situation is considered increasingly dangerous for public health . adverse health effects occur frequently , a sizeable proportion of the population is highly annoyed and sleep-disturbed . there is evidence that the risk of cardiovascular disease increases . 3.7 there are a number of important points to be read from these figures , which are expanded on in the guidelines . first , the who recognizes the existence of vulnerable groups and acknowledges the existence of individual differences in noise sensitivity . second , health begins to be degraded between 30 and 40 db . third , 30 db is the level that can be considered “ safe ” . lastly , 40 db and above can be considered “ unsafe ” . 3.8 as best practice and goodwill to the community i argue that the appellant should be using 30 db as their criterion . it is interesting to note that the originally who noise working party ( 2007 ) originally stipulated 30 db , but in the 2009 publication 40 db was stipulated . as originally drafted the who noise working party ( 2007 ) recommendation read thus : “ the review of available evidence leads to the following conclusions ... for the primary prevention of subclinical adverse health effects in the population related to night noise , it is recommended that the population should not be exposed to night noise levels greater than 30 db of l night , outside during the night when most people are in bed . therefore , l night , outside 30 db is the ultimate target of night noise guideline ( nngl ) to protect the public , including the most vulnerable groups such as children , the chronically ill and the elderly , from the adverse health effects of night noise . ” 3.9 the approach of the who ( 2009 ) is useful in some respects , but limiting in others . the noel / loael values were developed primarily with aviation and road annoyance data . reference to figure 3.0 above indicates that a universal criterion is likely to fail unless additional factors are taken into account , such as the temporal characteristics of the noise . additionally , both noel / loael values will not be constant across a defined population , as subgroups of that population will be more vulnerable to the effects of noise than others . while the who does acknowledge the existence of vulnerable groups , the 2009 levels nevertheless rest on aggregate data that for the most part do not distinguish vulnerable from non-vulnerable groups . as described in 2.6 above , such an approach constitutes an ecological inference fallacy . 3.10 finally , as table 3.2 attests , an lnight , outside of 40 db is recommended as representing the loael . it should be noted however that these guidelines were produced exclusively for the european context and not the new zealand context . for example , the who used a value of 21 db for sound attenuation from outside a building to inside , which is greater than the 10-15 db usually cited ( e.g . , etsu r 97 : who 1999 ) . given that new zealand dwellings are commonly made from lighter construction materials such as timber and weather board rather than heavier materials such as concrete and stone , the 21 db attenuation value is not particularly useful . 4.0 amenity 4.1 typically , noise can be quantified by sound exposure levels or audibility , and qualified in terms of unwantedness , annoyance , or loss of amenity . there is an expectation of “ peace and quiet ” when living in a rural area , and most choose to live in rural areas as they are bastions of tranquillity ( schomer , 2001 ) . a rural area is defined as an area with a population density less than 500 people per square kilometre . the literature shows that those who live in rural areas have different expectations regarding community noise compared to those living in suburban , urban , or industrial areas . people expect rural areas to be quieter , and consequently exposure to noise will produce a greater negative reaction in rural areas than other areas ( pedersen & persson , 2004 ) . it is evident in the literature that community setting is emerging as a powerful predictor of annoyance reactions . 4.2 if a proposed wind turbine installation encroaches rural and semi-rural areas populated by residents with a greater expectation for , and value on , peace and quiet , the reaction to the proposed wind turbines are likely to be negative . amenity values are based upon what people feel about an area , its pleasantness , or some other value that makes it desirable place to live . noise affects individuals and communities by modifying the extrinsic and intrinsic nature of the environment that attracts and holds people to the locality . 4.3 survey-based investigations of wind turbine noise have demonstrated a distinction in self-reported annoyance levels between respondents living in cities and those living in rural areas . because attitudes towards the noise source influence annoyance , then these rural residents are likely to be more annoyed than those living in suburban or urban neighbourhoods . pedersen and persson ( 2007 ) sum it up : “ … exposure from wind turbines would be more negatively appraised in an area that is perceived as unspoiled than in an area where several human activities take place … people choose environments that harmonise with their self-concept and needs , and that they remain in places that provide a sense of continuity . when a new environmental stressor occurs , the individual ’ s relationship with her or his place of residence is disrupted . such a distortion could possibly predispose for an increased risk of annoyance … expecting the home and its surroundings to be a suitable place for rest and recreation could conversely lead to an appraisal of the sound as threatening personal values . the sound was described as an intrusion into privacy that changed the image of a good home . ” the same report indicated that annoyance was most frequently reported when participants were relaxing outdoors or on “ barbecue nights ” . it can be embarrassing living near sources of community noise , and there is a public stigma that only those in the lower socio-economic bracket live in the vicinity of noise generators . such feelings discourage residents from inviting guests around to their houses , and thus community noise interferes with rest and recreational activities . 4.4 for a variety of reasons wind turbines are placed mainly in rural areas with low background sound levels . the operation of wind turbine clusters within the confines of the ohariu valley will undoubtedly produce noise that is incongruent with the natural soundscape of the area . the immediate and long-term effects of such noise will be to degrade amenity and impact upon the responses of a “ reasonable person ” , to the point where they may become “ forced emigrants ” . the affinity that rural dwellers have to the land is often difficult for their urban and suburban counterparts to comprehend , as too are their responses to unwelcome modification of their environment . 4.5 the revised version of nzs6808 includes an allowance for high amenity areas . you can not , however , put a price on amenity and neither can you put a decibel value on it . for the same reasons outlined in relation to annoyance ( see 3.4 – 3.5 above ) i would not recommend the approach outlined in nzs6808 as a guardian of amenity . 4.6 a survey recently undertaken my colleagues and i ( see 8.4 below ) included an open-ended question asking if there been any changes to the better or the worse in their living environment/ neighbourhood during the last year . comments from rural areas ( including the ohariu valley , makara and a turbine-free rural control area ) are presented in appendix a. my interpretation of these comments is thus . first , peace , quiet , and privacy , and threats thereof , are reoccurring themes . second , the comments from the ohariu valley indicate that the residents perceive the placement of turbines in the area as a threat to their quiet surrounds and amenity . the emotional intensity of these comments provides a picture of a community strongly connected with the valley , and for those opposing the turbines i predict especially strong annoyance reactions to turbine noise . third , residents in the ohariu vallet report hearing the turbines from makara , indicating the cumulative effects need to be considered . fourth , i note that even in the control areas there is a fear amongst residents that they may be next in line for turbine installations . 4.7 in the same survey we presented two questions relating to amenity , both rated on a five-point category scale : 1 ) i am satisfied with my neighbourhood / living environment , and 2 ) my neighbourhood / living environment makes it difficult for me to relax at home . when compared statistically to the control area , the makara sample were less satisfied with their living environment and found their living environment made it more difficult for them to relax at home than those in the control sample . the open-ended responses displayed in appendix a suggest that these differences may be explained by the presence or absence of wind turbines . amenity and visual impact 4.8 the visual impact of the turbines can also influence reactions to turbine noise , probably because the visual presence of the turbines can act as reminders of the negative impacts that they have had on people ’ s lives . in a danish study , the position of the listener ( on a flat landscape ) relative to the wind turbine influenced their perception of the noise more than the overall level of the turbine ’ s noise ( pedersen & nielsen , 1994 ) . other studies ( delvin , 2007 ) have likewise reported that , as a whole , wind turbines are viewed as eyesores and visual spoilers of the environment ( see cartoon , figure 4.0 ) . pedersen and persson ( 2004 ) hypothesize that , from an aesthetic perspective , those who view the wind turbines as ugly are likely to disassociate them from the landscape , and as a consequence , react more strongly to turbine noise . their findings have direct relevance to those who value the amenity and restorative features of the ohuria valley : “ wind turbines were described as environmentally friendly , necessary , but also as ugly ... seeing a wind turbine in an otherwise non-industrial environment may reduce the individual ’ s perception of the naturalness of the area and reduce the perception of restoration possibilities . ” figure 4.0 : a cartoon poking fun at wind turbine installation developers ( here meridian energy ) and nimbys ( not in my back yard ) alike ( from www.stuff.co.nz ) . 5.0 noise sensitivity 5.1 noise sensitivity , considered a stable personality trait that is relatively invariant across noise level , is a strong predictor of noise annoyance and is correlated with sleep quality . noise sensitive individuals can be described by two key characteristics . first , they are more likely to pay attention to sound and evaluate it negatively ( e.g . , threatening or annoying ) . second , they have stronger emotional reactions to noise , and consequently , greater difficulty habituating . 5.2 note that noise sensitivity is not a symptom of mental illness , but a measurable state that differs in intensity across the population . research has suggested that noise sensitivity is associated with mental illness . however , this does not mean that mental illness is a necessary prerequisite for reporting high sensitivity to noise , nor that noise sensitivity is a symptom of mental illness . as a trait , noise sensitivity is measured on a continuum from highly noise sensitive to highly noise resistant , and everybody falls somewhere along this continuum : highly noise sensitive highly noise resistant 5.3 i further dichotomise noise sensitivity into two different constructs ; state and trait noise sensitivity . state noise sensitivity is an emotional state that is characterized by feelings of annoyance due to circumstantial factors . it is evoked when individuals are exposed to noises that are perceived as psychologically undesirable or physically threatening . the emotional state is generally transitory but can remain as long as the noise exposure persists . trait noise sensitivity refers to relatively enduring individual differences in sensitivity to noise . if an individual has high trait noise sensitivity , they are likely to experience state noise sensitivity reactions more often . thus trait noise sensitivity is a measure of the probability of state noise sensitivity being experienced in future situations , judged on the frequency and intensity of the individual ’ s experience of state noise sensitivity in the past . 5.4 most individuals exhibit state noise sensitivity in certain situations . those with trait noise sensitivity , however , may try and avoid noisy areas and , if given the choice , may choose to live in quieter areas . this year myself and colleagues from the universities of otago and auckland collected data in both cities and rural areas , which included self-report noise sensitivity ratings . this data affords a comparison of noise sensitivity prevalence in the countryside or a city , and is presented graphically in figure 5.0. of remark are the disparities evident in the ‘ none ’ and ‘ high ’ sensitivity categories . note , however , that the estimates of noise sensitivity in rural areas may represent an under estimate due to the lack of noise and therefore lack of knowledge that one may be noise sensitive . figure 5.0 : bar graph plotting percentage of respondents indicating their category of noise sensitivity . black bars represent respondents from rural areas whilst grey bars represent those living in a city . 5.5 a scandinavian study on wind turbine noise and annoyance conducted in a rural area reported that fifty percent of respondents described themselves as sensitive to noise ( pedersen & persson , 2004 ) . this value contrasts with their estimates from urban areas ( approximately 20 % ) and suggests that noise sensitive individuals seek out rural areas for their lower levels of noise . from figure 5.0 it is evident that there is a greater proportion ( by a factor of 2 ) of noise sensitive individuals in rural areas than cities . 5.6 in the first three months of this year my team , in collaboration with brain injury nz , undertook interview-based research attempting to gain further insight into the experiences of living with noise sensitivity . we chose survivors of traumatic brain injury as noise sensitivity is the strongest predictor of subsequent postconcussive syndrome , and there is a high prevalence of noise sensitivity in this clinical population . we noted two recurrent themes in the transcripts . first , the debilitating affects of high noise sensitivity , and second , the inability of current clinical practice to detect or treat the condition . 5.7 while we purposively targeted a group with a high prevalence of extreme noise sensitivity , it should be remarked that individuals with similar levels of sensitivity will exist in the general population , that their sensitivity will not necessarily be traced to injury or disease ( though it might ) , and that these individuals will seek quiet areas in which to live . i include , in appendix b , a selection of quotes from the transcripts in order to advance an understanding of what it is like to experience noise sensitivity . here is one : “ for me , i dunno , probably the noise is one of the biggest things ; and if you could take one symptom away from me , if i had to choose one thing that i didn ’ t have to have , it would be the noise sensitivity , definitely . ” 6.0 primary health effects : annoyance 6.1 the word annoyance is often misinterpreted by the general public as a feeling brought about by the presence of a minor irritant . the medical usage , in contrast , exists as a precise technical term and defines annoyance as a mental state capable of degrading health . suter ( 1991 ) presents a formal definition of annoyance : `` annoyance has been the term used to describe the community 's collective feelings about noise ever since the early noise surveys in the 1950s and 1960s , although some have suggested that this term tends to minimize the impact . while `` aversion '' or `` distress '' might be more appropriate descriptors , their use would make comparisons to previous research difficult . it should be clear , however , that annoyance can connote more than a slight irritation ; it can mean a significant degradation in the quality of life . this represents a degradation of health in accordance with the world health organization 's ( who ) definition of health , meaning total physical and mental well-being , as well as the absence of disease . '' 6.2 both the physical nature of the sound and the psychological characteristics of the listener combine to produce noise annoyance . it is generally agreed that a physical threshold exists that , when exceeded , almost totally determines the levels of annoyance elicited by noise . below this threshold however , other psychological-based factors come to the fore . while there is a strong correlation between the sound pressure level ( i.e . , amplitude ) of a sound wave and the perceived loudness of a sound , there is no clear relationship between sound pressure level and the psychological responses that individuals have to a sound . annoyance can only partly be related to the physical characteristics of a sound , including amplitude ( i.e . , loudness ) , frequency ( i.e . , tonal characteristics ) , and how the sound changes across time ( e.g . , modulation ) . 6.3 many nonacoustical factors determine how annoyed one will become towards a source of noise . degrees of annoyance to noise can not be measured by acoustical equipment such as sound level meters ; instead it can only be described by the listeners themselves . thus , the response of the individual to the sound is just as important as the acoustic properties of the sound wave . the “ people ” side of noise is commonly absent from acoustics reports , where acousticians have a tendency to treat a spectrum analyzer or a free field microphone as equivalent to a human being . the reality is that the bulk of the annoyance response is likely to be explained by a collection of interacting traits and contextual factors that include age , attitude to the noise source , personality , mental functioning , time of day and noise sensitivity . for example , van den berg et al , ( 2008 ) notes that annoyance is also related to economic factors ( see figure 3.0 above ) , and present data showing that those who benefit economically from wind turbines are on average less annoyed than those who do not . 6.4 in the new zealand context little research has investigated noise annoyance . limited data does however exist . one recent urban study identified 15 % of the sample as having serious concerns about neighbourhood noise , with 44.3 % having some concerns ( carter et al . 2009 ) . the proportion of those seriously concerned with neighbourhood noise exceeded all other neighbourhood issues including rubbish in the street ( 7.3 % ) , walking around after dark ( 9.4 % ) , smells and fumes ( 6 % ) , and traffic and road safety ( 9.3 % ) . 6.5 currently there is not a single credible paper in the peer-reviewed literature stating that wind turbine noise is harmless to health . contra to the assertion that wind turbines have no health related effects , there is an emerging body of evidence informing us that under certain circumstance wind turbine noise can have substantial physiological and psychological impacts on the community . for brevity these studies are summarised and presented in appendix c. 6.6 noise sensitivity has a large impact on noise annoyance ratings , lowering annoyance thresholds by up to 10 db ( miedema & vos , 1999 ) . however , while there is a strong correlation between noise sensitivity and annoyance , the correlation between noise sensitivity and noise level is weak , echoing the marginal relationship found between noise annoyance and noise level . 6.7 attitudes towards wind turbines and their operators are related to perceived annoyance . a new zealand study ( wild , 2008 ) on public attitudes to wind turbine installations identified a substantial number of residents with negative attitudes induced by continual turbine breakdowns and the high levels of maintenance required . additionally , many respondents complained of the uneven spread of benefits of wind turbine installation , and a lack of local of benefits . the same study showed that , for people living within five kilometres of the turbines , attitudes towards the wind turbine installation appear to become more negative following the operation of the turbines ( see figure 6.0 ) . this trend was not observed with those living between 5 – 15 kilometres , and one can speculate that noise was a factor in this change . figure 6.0 : attitude towards a wind turbine complex , before and after operation , categorised by distance from place of current residence ( after wild ( 2008 ) , p. 135 ) . 7.0 primary health effects : sleep disturbance 7.1 sleep is a state of arousal characterized by an unresponsiveness to environmental stimuli and an absence of conscious activity . every living organism contains , within its dna , genes for a body clock which regulates an activity-inactivity cycle . sleep disturbance and impairment of the ability to return to sleep are not trivial events . in the short term , the resulting deprivation of sleep results in daytime fatigue and sleepiness , loss of wellbeing , poor concentration and loss of memory function . accident risks increase . in the longer term , sleep deprivation is linked to depression , weight gain , diabetes , high blood pressure and heart disease . 7.2 noise interferes with sleep in several ways . first , it may be sufficiently loud or annoying to prevent the onset of sleep or the return to sleep following an awakening . second , noise exposure during sleep may arouse or awaken the sleeper . noise insufficient to cause awakening may cause an arousal . an arousal is brief , often only a few seconds long , with the sleeper moving from a deep level of sleep to a lighter level and back to a deeper level . because full wakefulness is not reached , the sleeper has no memory of the event but the sleep has been disrupted just as effectively as if wakefulness had occurred . it is possible for several hundred arousals to occur each night without the sufferer being able to recall any of them . the sleep , because it is broken , is unrefreshing and there is a proportional relationship between arousals and doziness , fatigue , headaches and poor memory and concentration . 7.3 a note on the quality of sleep research , be it related to noise or otherwise , is warranted . the outcome measures used to estimate sleep quality , be they subjective reports or physiological measurements , have in recent times been exposed as unreliable or meaningless . both krystak and edinger ( 2008 ) and pirrera et al . , ( 2010 ) can be consulted for a critique of current methodologies . 7.4 audible wind turbine noise has the potential to cause arousals , sleep fragmentation and sleep deprivation . it is unfortunate that noise from wind turbines are often at their loudest and most disturbing at night due to an increase in atmospheric stability . in other research directly related to wind turbines one study reported that sixteen percent of respondents experiencing 35 db ( a ) or more of noise suffered sleep disturbances due to turbine noise , with all but two respondents sleeping with an open window in summer ( pedersen & persson , 2004 ) . others also report that wind turbines cause sleep deprivation ( harry , 2007 ) . residents in the vicinity of existing wind turbine installations in the manawatu region have reported hearing the turbines in their bedrooms at night , especially in summer even when windows are closed . pedersen & persson ( 2007 ) , studying the effects of wind turbine noise on sleep , showed that 36 % of respondents who were annoyed at wind turbine noise also reported that they suffered disturbed sleep ( compare 9 % for those not annoyed ) . the effect of wind turbines on sleep have yet to be sufficiently quantified , though it appears that chronic sleep disturbance is the most common complaint of those living near wind turbines . 7.5 other surveys of residents living in the vicinity of wind turbine installations show high levels of disturbance to sleep . a 2005 survey of 200 residents living within 1 kilometre of a 6 turbine , 9mw installation in france showed that 27 % found the noise disturbing at night ( butre 2005 ) . a similar us survey in 2001 ( kabes 2001 ) of a “ wind farm ” in kewaunee county , wisconsin reported that 52 % of those living within 400-800 metres found the noise to be a problem , 32 % of those living within 800-1600 metres and 4 % of those within 1600 and 3200 metres . 7.6 a study undertaken in the makara valley , and described in 8.4 below ( and see appendix a ) , indicated that , compared to matched-control areas , satisfaction with sleep is significantly less in turbine areas than non-turbine areas . while the noise contours presented by the appellant may claim to represent “ worst-case scenario ” i note that they do not represent peak noise levels , which are more likely to disturb sleep , and studies have consistently demonstrated that sleep quality is related to peak noise levels rather than aggregated measures such as db leq . nor does the “ worst-case scenario ” consider mechanical malfunction noise , which i have experienced myself on two occasions . i defer to the statement presented by rick james as to why the estimates supplied by the appellant should be treated with scepticism , and restate again that noise levels themselves are of limited utility when predicting human response to noise . 7.7 ohrstrom & rylander ( 1990 ) concluded that noise sensitive individuals have lower thresholds of noise reactivity during sleep than non-sensitive individuals . they demonstrated that noise sensitive individuals take longer to fall asleep than non-sensitive individuals and that sleep quality is more likely to be compromised by noise in sensitive individuals . marks and griefahn ( 2007 ) replicated these findings , reporting an association between noise sensitivity and subjective sleep quality , that is , greater sensitivity is linked to worsened restoration , deceased calmness , and difficulty to fall asleep . 8.0 secondary health effects : quality of life 8.1 like tobacco consumption or sun exposure , potential health deficits from noise exposure , be it turbine noise or any other variety , are unlikely to be immediate . this makes the measurement of such deficits a challenge . indeed , objective manifestation of health effects associated with noise-induced annoyance or sleep disturbance may only be detected after 5 to 15 years since the onset of exposure , whereas subjective appraisals of wellbeing and health will suffer no such time lag . 8.2 a variety of outcome measures have been reported in the literature to assess the impacts of noise , including annoyance , sleep disturbance , cardiovascular disease , and wellbeing . one approach to health assessment involves a subjective appraisal of health-related quality of life ( hrqol ) , a concept that measures general wellbeing and wellbeing in domains such as physical , psychological , social , and environmental wellbeing . the who ( 2009 ) noise guidelines ( europe ) likewise supports the use of quality of life measures ( p. 92 ) : “ the effects of noise are strongest for those outcomes that , like annoyance , can be classified under ‘ quality of life ’ rather than illness . what they lack in severity is made up for in numbers of people affected , as these responses are very widespread ” . 8.3 the who ( 1995 ; 1999 ; 2009 ) reports that noise-induced annoyance and sleep disturbance can , when chronic , compromise positive wellbeing and quality of life . dratva et al . ( 2010 ) using the short form ( sf36 ) health survey , reported an inverse relationship between annoyance and hrqol in relation to road traffic noise . they argued that hrqol would be expected to co-vary more with annoyance than with physical noise measurements . along with collaborators i recently demonstrated that sleep disruption and annoyance were mediators between noise sensitivity and hrqol ( shepherd et al . , 2010 ) . i would expect meridian energy to assess the potential impact of turbines on the quality of life of residents in the ohuria valley . if this has not been undertaken then arguably they have been negligent in their assessment of turbine impact . 8.4 to determine if wind turbine noise degrades quality of life in a manner consistent with road and aviation noise a team of new zealand researchers undertook exploratory research in the makara valley , a confined rural setting in which wind turbines have been operating for the past year , and which is in close proximity to the ohariu valley . we used a case-control design , the most appropriate in the context , and measured hrqol from residents in the makara valley and those living in a matched control area . the response rates , 31 % and 34 % respectively , can be considered high for this type of research ( compare to van den berg and colleagues ( 2008 ) 37 % response rate ) . each house received two copies of the questionnaire , which utilised a who tool to measure hrqol , a neighbourhood satisfaction survey designed to mask the intent of the study , and questions on amenity , noise annoyance , and noise sensitivity . details of the study were recently presented at a new zealand acoustics conference , and appendix d contains this presentation which affords a summary of the design and findings of the study . 8.5 statistical analysis ( see appendix d ) revealed some differences and some similarities between the two areas in terms of hrqol . first , the makara valley sample reported significantly lower physical hrqol , and they were also less satisfied with their sleep than those in control areas . second , the makara valley sample reported lower environmental hrqol , a domain that can be treated as equivalent to amenity . third , there were no statistical differences between the two areas in relation to social or psychological hrqol , although the latter was close to significance . finally , when rating overall hrqol there was again a statistical significant difference between the two areas . 8.6 these results were not entirely unanticipated . at the west wind ( i.e . , makara ) hearing dr van den berg and dr robert thorne received agreement from the experts ’ caucus to present a separate statement to the agreed matters : “ we believe that the conditions here agreed upon will protect residents from severe annoyance and sleep disturbance , but not from annoyance and loss of amenity . we believe annoyance and loss of amenity will be protected when the wind turbine noise limit would be 30 dba l95 in conditions of low wind speed at the dwellings and modulation restricted to 3 db . ” however , because a loss of amenity is related to annoyance , and annoyance may lead to sleep disruption ( see figure 1.0 ) , it appears from our data that while residents were protected from severe sleep disturbance , they still experience a degree of sleep disturbance that is sufficient to degrade their hrqol . 8.7 additionally , once turbines are installed in an area where there is local opposition a ‘ defeat reaction ’ may emerge . rylander ( 2004 ) describes the characteristics of the defeat reaction after exposure to noise as increased vulnerability to illness and a depression of mood precipitated by intense sorrow , deep frustration , and defeat . the defeat reaction may in turn be amplified by the presence of turbine noise . a swedish study ( pedersen & persson , 2007 ) reported that , for respondents who were annoyed by wind turbine noise , feelings of resignation , violation , strain , and fatigue were statistically greater than for respondents not annoyed by wind turbine noise . the data procured from the makara valley marshals evidence for the defeat reaction in that the makara sample rated themselves as significantly more feelings such as blue mood , despair , anxiety , or depression than the control sample . 8.8 these results point to a strong degradation of hrqol in the resident of makara . the ohariu valley proposal is in many was similar to the markara proposal , and so it can be supposed that the erecting of turbines will likewise degrade the hrqol of ohariu residents . 9.0 secondary health effects : stress-related disease 9.1 current thinking argues that both noise-induced sleep deficits and annoyance can induce stress-related disease . any object or event that an individual perceives as a threat to their safety or to the resting and restorative characteristics of their living environments can be classified as a stressor . noise is one such psychosocial stressor that can induce maladaptive psychological responses and negatively impact health via interactions between the autonomic nervous system , the neuroendocrine system , and the immune system ( see table 9.0 ) . table 9.0 : three systems implicated in the negative relationship between stress and health the autonomic nervous system a control system in which the brain manages numerous biological processes based upon the demands of the environment . the autonomic nervous system controls , amongst other processes , heart rate , digestion , respiration rate , salivation , perspiration , diameter of the pupils , urination , and sexual arousal . the neuroendocrine system the system linking processes in the central nervous system ( i.e . , the brain ) to the endocrine system , which releases hormones . the most thoroughly studied neuroendocrine complex , the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( hpa ) axis , has been implicated as the chief mechanism in the human stress response . the immune system a collection of bodily structures and processes concerned with the identification , elimination , and disposal of foreign objects ( i.e . , antigens ) . immune systems protect the body from infection , and when compromised , leave an individual vulnerable to disease . 9.2 it has long been accepted that either physical or psychological stressors can produce a physiological stress reaction . stress is characterised by physiological changes that prepare the organism to survive a stressor . as figure 9.0 shows , two main systems are activated by stressors , with noise used as an example of a stressor . the hpa axis produces glucocorticoids such as the stress hormone cortisol . cortisol restrains immune system activity which otherwise can become damaging , but in excess , this restraint of defence can increase vulnerability to disease . it is accepted that sleep deprivation increases cortisol levels . the sam-axis produces , amongst other hormones , adrenalin , an important component of the sympathetic nervous system ’ s fight-or-flight response . adrenaline has the potential to regulate most of the body ’ s biological systems , and increases heart and respiration rates during episodes of stress . note that both pathways are ultimately under the control of the central nervous system ( i.e . , the brain ) , and this central regulation explains the large range of individual differences in the response to noise . figure 9.0 : schematic representation of the body ’ s response to unwanted sound . both the hpa axis and the sam axis are regulated by a brain structure known as the hypothalamus . 9.3 how the brain and our hearing systems interact to produce a stress response has been the relatively well studied . figure 9.1 is a contemporary conceptualisation of this interaction , and such models can help us explain , for example , noise sensitivity . acute reactions to noise that have been explained by brain mechanisms include the startle reflex , the orienting response , and the fight/flight/freeze response . these reactions are short-lived , lasting a few seconds , and are accompanied by instantaneous physiological responses , such as cortisol release . chronic exposure results in annoyance and sleep disturbance , both of which are health effects in the own right , and both of which can be induced by a stressor and lead to physiological stress reactions . 9.4 in 2009 i collaborated with members of the university of auckland ’ s department of psychology and investigated the physiological underpinnings of noise sensitivity . by nonlinear analyse of heart activity ( i.e . , the electrocardiogram ) we were able to discern a significant relationship between noise sensitivity and sympathetic activity ( for significance see table 9.0 ) , and between noise sensitivity and galvanic skin response , which is a marker of emotional response . these results replicate the findings of dodd ’ s ( 2001 ) pilot study , and confirm that noise sensitivity has physiological correlates . i present in appendix e the results from a single participant to display the various analytical indices . using a pre-validated noise sensitivity scale ( the noiseq ) this participant scored relatively high on the noise sensitivity continuum . figure 9.1 : the link between noise and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( hpa ) axis . note : raf = reticular activating formation . 9.5 noise sensitivity may partly be explained by a hypoactive parasympathetic , and a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system . noise sensitive individuals may delay the termination of sympathetic responses due to an uncoupling of the autonomic nervous system and the amygdala-prefrontal circuits ( see figure 9.1 ) that interpret stressful stimuli and enact the appropriate stress response . the result is that the specific brain circuits ( i.e . , sympathoexcitatory circuits ) get caught in a positive feedback loop leading to hyper-vigilance and misattribution that then produce maladaptive cognitions ( i.e . , annoyance ) . as the stress accumulates , there is increased activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic-adreno-medullary system ( see figure 9.0 ) . 9.6 almost 50 years of quantitative research has demonstrated that long-term noise-induced annoyance and sleep disturbance are associated with stress-related disease . the literature concentrates mainly on road , rail , aviation , and other neighbourhood noise sources . there is no evidence currently published that leads me to the conclusion that wind turbine noise should not be treated the same , and as figure 3.0 testifies , there may be good reason to suspect that turbine noise is in fact more dangerous than other forms of noise . 10.0 conclu ding remarks 10.1 in europe ( who , 2009 ) noise is a recognised environmental pollutant that degrades sleep , quality of life and general function . utility-scale wind energy generation , involving the saturation of an optimum number of wind turbines in a fixed area , is not without health impact . however , the management of these impacts have been hindered by a systemic failure in the prediction of noise levels and sound characteristics emanating from wind turbine installations . i am not implying that these shortcomings are exercises of deceit by members of the acoustics discipline , but rather there is substantive international evidence showing that these errors are due to a lack of adequate methodology . deceit has , arguably , been nurtured by the lack of acknowledgment regarding the limitation of current methods . mr rick james will describe these limitations in the statement that he presents to this hearing . 10.2 new zealand has a poor record when it comes to the responsible positioning of wind turbine installations . many of the turbine installations erected in the manawatu region were initially welcomed by residents who supported renewable energy . however , this initial enthusiasm was based upon reassurances from the developers that turbine noise would not intrude into homes . the resulting lack of concordance between the predicted impacts of the noise and the actual impacts of the noise has lead to a rise in resistance to wind turbine installations in the manawatu region . a similar situation occurred at makara , although in this instance the turbines were not initially welcomed by the bulk of the community . further evidence comes from a recent compliance report ( lloyd , 2010 ) undertaken on the te rere hau wind turbine installation that indicates that the complaints made by nearby residents regarding noise exposure are justified on the basis of recent noise level readings . note that these readings are discordant with those originally predicted and do not comply with the original resource consent conditions . 10.3 i further suggest that it is a mistake to judge potential health effects on noise level alone . given that noise level explains between 15 – 20 percent of the variation in the annoyance response across individuals , i would recommend that noise level be given a 15 – 20 % weighting in the decision as to whether the turbines should go ahead or not . instead most weight should be placed on the potential amenity threats and the impact of vulnerable groups in the valley , including the elderly and children , and noise sensitive individuals . because of the discrepancies between predicted and actual noise levels it would be prudent to rely on evidence coming from real people at established wind turbine installations ( e.g . , te rere hau , makara , tararua ) than disputed mathematical models . 10.4 chronic ( i.e . , long term ) exposure to unwanted sound can compromise health , and these adverse reactions to noise do not easily disappear with repeated exposures . it is proposed that adverse reactions to noise can reduce over time , a process known as habituation , which can be a physiological or behavioural . the who ( 1999 ) asserts that a habituation to noise is a highly individual matter . noise sensitive individuals or individuals with certain types of mental illnesses are less likely to habituate to noise than noise resistant individuals . this lack of habituation is expected given the evolutionary significant roles undertaken by the auditory system , and as such we would predict , and indeed find , differences across individuals . 10.5 there are numerous reasons why wind turbine developers should be discouraged from placing turbines in the green belt areas around cities . the decision from this hearing is crucial in as much as it will determine the boundaries for turbine placement . supporting the proposal will expose a good number of other lifestyle/semi-rural communities to the threat of turbines , while opposing the proposal will signal that developers need to explore less populated areas outside of the greenbelts . from the original consent hearing held in 2008 i understand that new zealand is not lacking in wind resources and it there is vast opportunity to develop more isolated areas . 10.6 ruling against the mill creek proposal will financially disadvantage a minority of the community . supporting the mill creek proposal will compromise the well-being of a great many more residents . in addition , those who elicit strong emotional reactions to the loss of amenity that will accompany the turbines will also likely exhibit high annoyance responses to the turbine noise that will encroach the ohariu valley soundscape . furthermore , those individuals who are highly noise sensitive will likewise suffer from the turbine noise . 10.7 it is possible that psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy ( cbt ) could be used to reprogramme the thought processes of those experiencing annoyance through the amenity route , though such a solution may be seen as morally reprehensible by some . for the individuals with noise sensitivity cbt would not be effective as this is a trait rather than a state condition . for both these groups i would advise leaving the ohariu valley if the turbines are constructed as habituation is unlikely and sleep deprivation and/or stress-related disease is likely and , from the onset , quality of life will decrease . 10.8 it is not clear to me that meridian has undertaken sufficient duty of care in assessing the health impacts of turbines in the ohariu valley . for example , to the best of my knowledge they have not assessed prevalence of vulnerable groups ( elderly , children ) or traits ( noise sensitivity ) or considered factors that predict amenity values ( e.g . , length of residence ) . nor have they reasonably dealt with the experiences of residents in the adjacent makara valley . there is a sense that they have attempted to suppress meaningful debate in the direct links between noise and health and instead present arguments based on fears of technology . while i have some sympathy for this argument in certain contexts ( e.g . , the placement of cell phone towers ) the approach is not relevant to the current context . 10.9 based on these observations ( i.e . , 10.8 ) , based on data i have collected and analysed , and based on the current state of knowledge linking noise to impaired health in vulnerable persons , i opine that consent should not be granted for the proposed turbines in the ohariu valley . references butré j-l.

farms is leading to a wee bit of over-crowding ( i.e . ; curtails some shooting and stock movement ) . but has advantages of meeting interesting people . a1.8 too much sub-division of rural land a1.9 problem with boy racers , but healthy environment , friendly neighbours who are not too close . road has recently been widened , which has worsened the boy racer situation a1.10 extensive comments regarding housing development without providing infrastructure to support it , examples of problems caused were provided . a1.11 a council introduced recycling programme is good . housing development without upgrading the roads is putting too much pressure on the neighbourhood , making it unsafe for pedestrians , cyclists and horse riders . a1.12 council has a long-term plan to develop the area into high density , affordable housing . community is concerned about social problems , noise and pollution affecting quality of life and desire to remain in the neighbourhood . a1.13 happy with rural lifestyle after moving from city to get away from bad neighbours , in-fill housing , over-crowding and lack of privacy a1.14 problems with mentally ill neighbours a1.15 we do n't know our neighbours a1.16 neighbours pets/hand reared animals are allowed to roam free into our property and eat our gardens . our young son has been confronted by the animals and now does n't cope well with those animals elsewhere . a1.17 no buses in rural areas , and no street lights . the roads are dangerous without them a1.18 since council relinquished local landfill to private ownership , roadside & park litter increased dramatically a1.19 inconsiderate groups cyclists who wo n't pull over to let cars past , and sport-based road closures which do n't take into account that people need to take children to school , or travel to work etc . a1.20 semi-rural environment getting more populated causes earth works , less privacy , and increased problem in narrow roads . council also reduced recycling efforts which causes rubbish build-up a1.21 increase in fast traffic a1.22 environmental pollution of wind turbines . the proposed placement would expose us to noise pollution a1.23 large increase in traffic since i moved here 3 years ago a1.24 would like to know outcome of survey , deanne gabita thegabites @ xtra.co.nz neighbour has burgled them several times , affects quality of life . a1.25 wind turbines would be the only reason i would ever want to leave here . a1.26 a lot of theft in our area lately . a1.27 as long as there are no wind farms build along side us i think we 'll spend the rest of our lives here ! a1.28 joy-riding traffic is a problem in our rural area , especially for the people walking , riding bicycles , and horses . a1.29 the roads are not safe for the amount of traffic . bikes , children , horses and pedestrians sharing the road with cars , trucks , farm vehicles etc . a1.30 no wind turbine was a great relief for everyone . motorcross drivers & logging trucks are dangerous on the roads . lack of broadband is frustrating . a1.31 poor quality dangerous roads , & poor public transport . commute is too long a1.32 a walkway has just opened up , which has spoilt our seclusion a1.33 the community is under threat by potential wind farms a1.34 feel threatened by the wind farm destroying their peace a1.35 local council is investing in the neighbourhood with things like roads , library art-work , rubbish & recycling . i feel as though my rates are benefiting me . a1.36 rural setting means little or no services from council such as lighting/footpaths a1.37 neighbours dogs constant barking a1.38 council do n't consider local residents , and ca n't seem to agree with regional council a1.39 subdivisions mean more people , roads not up to it . too narrow and winding . pesky road cyclists who think they own the road . a1.40 subdivisions have caused friction between neighbours a1.41 roading ca n't cope with population growth in neighbourhood a1.42 vandalism from kids who do n't live in the area , and people dumping rubbish who do n't live in the area table a.2 : makara valley a2.1 i live in makara which is a rural community . the westwind farm has been commissioned in the last 12 months . this has had a considerate or great affect on my way of life , and has changed the way i live and also deprived me of my greatest interests and activities . a2.1 installation of wind turbines have had a negative effect on my environment a2.1 there is only 1 issue in our neighbourhood that causes concern and that is the building of an industrial wind generation site called westwind by meridian , an soe . in many ways it has brought this community closer together to fight the common foe . the problem is not the visual . the problem is the noise generated by the wind turbines . we are concerned about the adverse health effects and sleep deprivation that is caused by them . well over 1000 complaints have been logged on the 0800 complaints line , but little has been done to improve the situation , the wind industry noise standard nzs6808 is not adequate to protect residents when the turbines are built with no consultation with residents . we didn ’ t want them there , and the government and their soe rode roughshod over our concerns . a2.1 we live in makara , have been here 6 years , moved here for the quiet life plus having more land to enjoy . we enjoy being outside working on our land . i work full time in the cbd so look forward to coming home to the quiet , but unfortunately in the last two years we have had turbines installed . we see twelve of them from our home . when i sit in my chair in the living room , this is alright but when they get noisy this is what i get upset about . you go to bed to sleep and the noise is there , it sounds like a plane that keeps going around and around and does not fly away , or it is the vibration we feel . i have not had a decent night ’ s sleep in that time . i can wake up to about six times in the night so my quality of life has changed for the worse . nobody wants to know . basically we are left to get on with it . if we complain we are a pack of whiners or whingers . our rural lifestyle is horses , no transport , no lighting , but we do have a café . a2.1 we live in a rural village – access to shops , medical , public transport etc in a 10/15 min drive over a winding road up a steep hill . we have been inflicted by a wind farm with visual and noise pollution , completed late last year . a2.1 not in the last year , but previously . turbines have been built behind our property causing grief , lack of sleep and lack of stress in family harmony . a2.1 wind turbines have spoilt the district . a2.1 i live on a lifestyle block on the fringe of wellington city . a2.1 i live within 2.3 of 5 turbines . they are to the north + northwest ( prevailing wind ) of me + some to the south . i live on the valley flat . the sound is noticeable during the day but at night it bothers me when i am a ) trying to go to sleep b ) if i wake up . a2.1 it is not a loud noise but it is a vibration . i admit it probably meets sound conditions of the resource consent but this says more about what is allowable under resource consent than about what is reasonable and comfortable . without adequate sleep or with disturbed sleep i begin to feel anxious and stressed and it is hard to separate out what is contributing most to the stress i experience . i have just returned from 5 days away in the south island . i had a fantastic trip so probably my ratings reflect that . a2.1 power station wind farm has destroyed the recreational and tranquillity of the region with unexplained vibrations and noise pollution . people working outside are effectively bombarded with frequencies with cause headaches , dizziness , and motion sickness . this is amplified at night when sleeping . a2.1 the biggest change in my living environment has come from the direct impact of the wind farm built in our district despite strong opposition from residents . i now have 11 visible turbines in my direct line of sight – the closest is 1.2 kms ranging to 2.9 kms . i am disturbed by noise , sight , vibration , flickering shadows and red lights on top of turbines . my sleep is disturbed . i live in a rural environment for its peace , lack of housing , beauty , relaxed lifestyle . the wind farm has changed all that , we are not compensated nor draw any direct benefit from them ( unless of course i include some notion of a reduction of green-house gasses and global warming etc etc ) a2.1 as far as my community is concerned , this questionnaire would have great relevance and significance if it were to study the extremely harmful effects of living within a short distance of wind turbines . overseas studies are beginning to show how people and communities in general are suffering . to apply pressure on the government and energy suppliers , they need to see a properly conducted survey that hopefully would stop wind turbines being sited so close to people ’ s homes . all universities and the nz whoqol group could make a significant contribution . please think seriously about doing this . a2.1 meridian energy has completed construction of “ west wind ” wind farms in our quiet rural area . it at times produces noise into the environment that dominates the background noise levels and sounds . residents have no compensation for their changed living environment . most consumers of power don ’ t think about the consequences of their usage – our quality of life is effected . a2.1 the biggest change has been the building and operating of the wind farm . i have had to de-tune my ears and senses to the noise created by the turbines . generally i sleep all night and the turbines have woken me on several occasions , and i have not been able to sleep . the generally absolute silence we loved living here has gone . sydney – balmain is quieter than our property now . a2.1 our living environment has changed dramatically in the last year or so . meridian energy has built ‘ west wind ’ , a wind power station with turbines along the ridges that face our homes . the turbines are too close to homes ; there are around 125 private homes within 2km of the turbines . many homes lie downwind from the turbines – the prevailing wind flows over the power station site towards homes . as we said , this carries the noise for greater distances . the company told the general public that : “ the turbines will not be noisy for the residents of makara ” – and so got the general public to support their proposal . now it is noisy for us , the company says they always said there would be some noise ! ! the trucks started at 3:30am every morning except weekends ( when on saturday it was 6am ) – during construction . the background sound levels at my home have been measured at 14.1dba at night – so the traffic woke me up , and then i could not get back to sleep . meridian assured the court construction traffic would not start until 6am . it took six months to get the 3:30am start stopped – by that time i was exhausted ( and my husband too ) with the lack of sleep . my husband ’ s work also suffered . the power company has treated our community with utter disdain – as if we do not exist even . they did not carry out the background noise testing that they were supposed to have carried out – they get away with whatever they want – leaving the community powerless and with a completely changed – for the worse – environment . this is unjust , as they have profited from their dishonesty and cavalier disregard while the community has suffered , yet the community was always honest in it ’ s claims . meridian has stopped access to the makara farm/terawhiti which we have always been able to access in the past to go over the hill to access the coast further south , so considerably restricting recreation opportunities that used to abound in our environment . our landscape has been changed from an outstanding natural landscape to a vast and kinetic industrial landscape . what we used to enjoy and appreciate has been lost . we can not avoid seeing turbine blades from our deck and the garden around our home which faces towards the nw to catch our sun . we have spent most weekends away from makara and our home , to escape . a2.1 we have a good neighbourhood ( rural ) . meridian west wind project has caused all sorts of issues – initially , we had a mutual enemy that brought us together . however , now , the reverse seems to be happening – with some people taking what they can from meridian and others who have serious noise issues find that attitude obnoxious – so the turbines are causing rifts that were never there when we moved out to makara . endless giant piloted truck movements through our formally quiet rural roads to fix broken turbines is annoying . the council doesn ’ t really care . a2.1 before the turbines were built , there was no loss of sleep , nausea and headaches . within three months of their construction the symptoms started . it ’ s terrible now when the wind comes from the north of northwest . the quality of life is gone . how the government and the city council have allowed this to be built is completely beyond my comprehension . table a.3 : mill creek a3.1 many changes for the worse , more houses being built , neighbours closer ( sounds travel in the countryside ) , townies with no idea of animal control and pest control , and consideration , and fencing issues etc . don ’ t respect boundaries , animals straying , more traffic – speeding , boyracers , motorbikes , atvs . people cutting down trees and not replanting . damage and silt affecting streams and running off neighbourhood properties . rubbish along the road – dumped from vans and cars . windfarm issues – changed whole wellbeing feeling of the neighbourhood and split families etc . some positives , some people planting trees , native bush : more birds . some going organic , reducing spray use and fencing off streams from stock . a3.2 the proposal of a windfarm in our neighbourhood has had an extremely negative impact on our local/neighbourhood community . it goes to the environment court late in the year . a3.3 problem , erecting windmills , luckily we still fight . neighbours , great , quiet , pleasant . bugger all street lights – thank god ! a3.4 we live in a rural area , now fighting wind farm . too many houses and subdivisions being allowed with little or no consideration to existing landowner house sitings . this is putting huge pressure on the quality of life in this rural area and seems the “ rules ” for subdivision are not being followed at all . a3.5 we live on a lifestyle block in takara gorge road , ohariu valley . we have noticed an increase in road traffic over the last year . this is in part due to improved road surfacing encouraging more users , especially in the weekend . speed and noise is a constant issue and concern , especially with our community foot traffic on the road , ie house/children + also cyclists being unsafe as a result . since west wind turbine installations have become fully operational we can hear the turbines and we are more than 8 km from them . we don ’ t hear them every day but it is concerning that we hear them at all . many of our neighbours can hear them and are suffering disturbances to their sleep and quality of life . we are deeply concerned about the proposed mill creek wind turbine installation which will be much closer to our home . a3.6 some levels of stress related to proposed windfarm ( mill creek ) . stress related to neighbours not getting on so well ( those for vs those opposed to wind farm ) . worry over potential effects of noise and how this may affect our quality of life . currently we can not really hear the turbines at makara – just occasionally and not too intrusive . a3.7 road into the valley has got busier with more trucks and general traffic . our outlook to the south ( makara ) is now dominated by 20 – 30 turbines . we were visited by meridian ’ s landscape expert earlier this year as our property has been identified as being significantly affected by their proposed mill creek wind farm . photo simulations show that most of the windfarm is potentially visible from our property . during their visit they commented that we could be surrounded by turbines . we find this very distressing as our surroundings are very important to us and we put our heart and soul into creating a special environment for our family . it has been a shock for our community that ( 80 % ) to learn that our homes have no protection and we have no representation and support from the council or government . in the past year we have installed solar hot water and solar panels which provide all the electricity we need with any excess going into the grid . this has not caused any disturbance to our neighbourhood ! a3.8 the main problem is the divide in the community about the proposed turbines , which would very much affect our household with visibility , noise , glare , and vibrations . otherwise we enjoy the peace , tranquillity , and privacy and that ’ s why we choose to live in this area . a3.9 we have a peaceful rural lifestyle that we relish and i feel this contributes to a high sense of wellbeing , having a sanctuary to return to at the end of the day . a3.10 traffic and the road seem busier . community discussion centred around proposed wind farm . this causes mistrust and tense feeling where before there was none . lack of protection and representation is a big issue . destruction of community is a possibility if wind farm goes ahead . people value their lifestyle and appreciate amenity values in the valley . we can see 20-30 turbines from makara when we were told that we would see none by the developer – this has caused us to question motives and honesty . a3.11 loss of community spirit due to small section of community seeking to establish a wind farm on the nearby hills . a3.12 our neighbourhood was the ideal rural lifestyle that we wanted and moved into the valley for , however , in the last year project westwind has caused some noise nuisance and the possibility of the mill creek wind farm proceeding is extremely concerning to us as we would be less than 2k from the nearest proposed turbines . the experiences of the residents at makara are of grave concern regarding noise and health affects from the turbines not to mention loss of property value . the court processes over the proposed mill creek has divided the community , previously it was a very strong and close rural community , now it is divisive . i worry about our future if mill creek gets consent , whether we will be able to live in our houses , if it will devalue , i am very noise sensitive and worry about how i will deal being that close to turbines . this is a very real concern to myself , my husband , and many residents in the community . i am not adverse to change , technology , wind farms in general or green alternatives , but i strongly object to having my quality of life in my own home reduced by noise , vibration , visual disturbances and possible health effects on the basis of “ its all for the greater good of the nation ” . a3.13 we live in a beautiful rural environment however the threat of wind turbines coming into our environment has caused stress in the community and great fear of loss at our unique environment . a3.14 we live 6-8 km from the new west wind industrial turbine complex . since it started we have been woken and prevented from sleeping . there has been tinnitus , developing headaches , lack of concentration and disturbing feelings that courses through the body , difficulty breathing and tightness in the chest . we feel disempowered as no government minister or councillor will even meet us let alone discuss and are actively supporting plans to extend closer still to our homes . a3.15 we are very fortunate to live in a rural area , approx 6 km from johnsonville . we have 6 children aged between 7-17 yrs . i believe our environment has affected our children and ourselves in a positive way . everyone is keen to stay home more and enjoy the surroundings . however , there is a lot of discord in our area due to proposed wind turbines being installed next year . we have not entered into the argument or discussions surrounding the issue . a3.16 since project west wind was commissioned we have had numerous occasions when we could hear them . until meridian fixed the special audible characteristic problem they could be heard as a distant rumbling noise in n ’ westly wind conditions but on top of that noise was a clear mechanical noise like a distant aeroplane . the noise would come and go . since sac has been ‘ removed ’ by meridian , the noise disturbance has reduced but on occasion it can still be heard as a distant rumbling . on one night in early june ( frosty ) i could hear blade swish . these turbines are 6.7 km to the west of us . we are faced with the prospect of another 31 turbines ( project mill creek ) also a meridian energy project . i am extremely anxious that the noise from these turbines will dominate our living environment here on takarau gorge road . the nearest 4 turbines will be between 1.7 and 2.0 km away from us in the north west if meridian are granted consent for mill creek . i have visited properties that are furiously affected by noise from makara on the lower takarau gorge road and on the south makara road . these properties are between 1.4 and 2.0 km away . the residents are suffering noise disturbance and their sleep is affected . i know and understand these consequences . there are many families in the ohariu valley that refuse to believe these affects . i am concerned that they will suffer as well . a3.17 i live a semi-rural area that has changed slowly over the last 50 yrs . the changes are currently escalating due to proposed wind turbines to be placed quite close to residences and a marked upgrade in socio-economic residents . a3.18 ohariu valley has been an unspoiled part of new zealand ’ s history until meridian desecrated the makara area with 68 wind turbines . unaware of the true disturbances these turbines would create due to the total mis-information supplied by meridian and the lies fed to the ohariu valley residents by meridian and the directors of windcorp , the residents unfortunately did not support the makara community as we should have to stop the west wind project from going ahead . the true ill-health effects of turbines of this size situated so close to people ’ s homes have been documented world wide and proven to be true yet meridian chose to ignore them and up to now the courts have not taken seriously the extent of the effects . this has to change and these wind farms stopped in closer than at least 15 ks from the nearest home . people ’ s lives are being ruined for a short-lived monetary gain by the likes of meridian energy . a3.19 we are currently fighting a proposal to build a wind farm being erected in our gorgeous valley . this is a major stress both emotionally and financially on ourselves , our family , and our community . it will be resolved in the environmental court this october . i suggest you repeat your survey after the outcome is known , that might teach you all a lot more ! a3.20 we now have an industrial wind farm less than 2kms away from our farm . not only is this a noise issue but also with consent given for another wind farm to be put in on yet another lot of hills to the north of us , they ( wind turbines ) will also be a visual problem as well , caught in between industrial sites . no pleading from our community , re noise conditions has made any difference at all ! no compensation for loss of property value , simply lack of consideration for a very unique small community that doesn ’ t have a chance against a power company . a3.21 i have lived in a quiet rural environment for 11 years by choice . 1. because it is quiet . 2. because it offers a life style choice ( horse care/farming on 62 acres ) . 3. because it is close to the city where i can get part time work if needed . 4. neighbours are too far away to be a problem . i live a comfortable , busy , rewarding life . i am now threatened by meridian and 5 other ‘ neighbours ’ by a proposed 31 industrial wind farm less than 3 km ’ s from my paradise . i get sleep disturbance from west wind ( west farm ) at makara – 6-8 kms away that has already been commissioned . i ’ m extremely anxious about : a ) my property value . b ) my community polarisation over this issue . c ) the cost to me personally fighting to preserve my neighbourhood . a3.22 wind turbine centres . we live 4.5 km away from makara westwind wind energy centre and i ’ m woken sometimes by a low frequency grinding noise , 3 – 4 am . there is another meridian project planned 1.3 km from our house ( mill creek ) & we know that the noise will be unacceptable . the big drive behind these so called green projects comes from the e.t.s & the govt , council are hell bent on pushing them through . we ’ re not heard by the general public as they have been brainwashed & the turbines aren ’ t in their faces . the media , tv , newspapers won ’ t air our complaints as executives on their boards are also on meridian ’ s – ie fairfax etc . a3.23 mill creek wind farm proposal by meridian has split the community into 2 divisive halves . those supporting it ie farmers that have leased land & their friends + people not concerned or informed about the potential noise and health impacts & those that are concerned . the proposition has halted much of the real estate activity which is a classic demonstration that everyone want green power but not in their backyard ie lifestyle blocks were very much sought after until announcement if the wind farm came thru . seems that it is the locals that must pay for the greater good of green energy… a3.24 the last 2.5 years have been incredibly difficult with the proposed wind farm . the stress of your living environment potentially changing & confrontation from people proposing change has been very intimidating and as a result at times it has been difficult to sleep . a3.25 in our neighbourhood there is a proposal to build a wind farm within 2.5 km of our home . this is of grave concern to my family due to the industrialisation of our countryside , our view from our home and the potential noise disturbance . this has caused stress and concern to us . a3.26 since the build and start up of the turbines in makara i have found them visually offensive ( i can see approx 20 from my home ) and when they were first being built i was reduced to tears on more than one occasion . they have turned my rural views to a industrial abomination . the noise produced by these turbines ( approx 8 – 10 km distant i estimate ) has caused me physical distress , sleep disturbance and a funny feeling of pressure – my ears in certain wind conditions . the combination of these plus having to fundraise/put my life into a holding pattern to fight the progress of destroying ohariu valley with more turbines has caused some stress in my relationship both at home and at work . ohariu valley was one of the most loving , supportive communities i have ever living in and turbines have completely split this community into a number of groups with all the associated distrust , lies , and backstabbing as those who want the turbines ( they are getting money from meridian ) try to undermine and destroy the rival group . a woman ’ s support group that was very strong – this valley for more than 50 years is now falling apart as various woman from both sides will no longer mix socially based on their opinions of the turbines . a3.27 this neighbourhood in ohariu valley used to be a wonderful , friendly , peaceful place to live . not now : people are at war : families have fallen out with each other , marriages broken down , & neighbours not being nice to each other all over money = the cause = wind turbines . five families are getting millions of dollars & a almost 100-200 other families have to live with the noise , vibration , property devaluation + sleep deprivation . we are looking for somewhere else to live – but will cost a fortune to move & we would have to degrade . my life right now is not pleasant for my family and our quality of life is not good . this reflects in our daily output which is reduced . this is more than sad – it is destructive to the community = fatal for society . a3.28 since the greedy farmers in the valley put up wind farms they have split the community into two . the loving peaceful valley that i moved into will never return . they have destroyed the peace and harmony that has existed for over 100 years . having the wind farm proposal going through concert has put our life on hold and even if we wanted to sell we will sell for a lot less than what we purchased it for . a3.29 a couple of points that may ( or may not ) be relevant . 1 ) i have been recently widowed and this has affected / lowered some of my satisfaction results which would previously have been higher . 2 ) i live rurally so many of the issues of are non-issues . 3 ) the peace / tranquillity / satisfaction with my neighbourhood is threatened by a potential wind farm within the immediate vicinity . i am sensitive to noise so if this were to go ahead it would change some answers i am sure . appendix b table b : selected comments from interviews with eight traumatic brain injury survivors experiencing noise sensitivity . each participant received the same series of questions probing their experiences with everyday sound before and after the injury . b.1 um it ’ s more frustration really , its , the frustration that i can ’ t do anything about it and i have to live with it b.2 i ’ m getting frustrated with myself cause i can ’ t think the way i want to think , it takes a lot more effort to concentrate on my conversations or what ’ s happening around me b.3 and it ’ s like god i just want to sleep and you can ’ t , it ’ s like you ’ re not in control of your own brain b.4 i ’ m much less tolerant of children crying around me , um ... .yer so i think noise differently lead to impatience with people b.5 it really annoys me when people who can ’ t walk without slopping their feet ... .it really gets on my nerves and i think , ohhh god , can ’ t walk , can ’ t walk near , can ’ t be near them b.6 i am horrendously embarrassed all the time , i didn ’ t even want to talk to people b.7 i felt very inadequate , i felt inadequate as a mother , as a partner because i can ’ t understand what was going on around me on a day to day basis b.8 initially , initially after the head injury i thought all that stuff was going to fade into the background ; i thought the noise sensitivity and that sort of stuff would just fade into the distance and life would become normal again , um , to what i had known before b.9 when you have a lot of noise like that it increases your fatigue , if ... . i guess the level of noise you hear has an effect on the stimulation on your brain and that ’ s where the fatigue comes in , pain comes in b.10 it ’ s a conglomeration of noise and i find i just get overloaded to the point where i just want to escape from it b.11 went to a cafe in mission bay and we were there for an hour and i could feel my fatigue levels getting higher and higher because um ... .having to concentrate because there were um people just that background noise and also cars and truck driving around and as i got more tired you become more sensitive and you notice the sounds more b.12 i find it hard to concentrate on more than one thing at a time , i think also that when it happens , when you ’ re out , you can hear both things but can concentrate on either b.13 i can ’ t um , i lose my train of thought if noise comes in and interrupts me , like the phone going , er like the phone ringing ... .its really loud ... i lose my train of thought quite quickly and can ’ t get it back it ’ s disrupted my thinking , it disrupts my peace , it disrupts my concentration , its , its err ... .it ’ s changed the way i live ... . b.14 if i could , flick that magic switch and switch off , block out the noise that people can , can learn to block out and work with , with life would be so much easier ... . i could concentrate better on my studies ... . b.15 it has , the implications have been huge because it ’ s restricted , it ’ s restricted my entertainment side of things , i don ’ t we use to go out a bit , i don ’ t now ... .um it ’ s restricted that its restricted activity that i would do , before i had a brain injury i use to like doing things like going on the rollercoaster ’ s and stuff when we went away , i use to enjoy noisy activities , um and i won ’ t , i don ’ t even do them now like noise stuff b.16 if i go to the gym and i have to think if i ’ m not having a good day then either i won ’ t go to the gym because i know it ’ s going to be harder because there are lots of sounds b.17 i don ’ t go to sports anymore , i use to be a netball player and a coach , but it , i can ’ t stand the sound of the whistle b.18 taking them ( two young boys ) to music class and stuff like that i wish i was able to do but i would have dropped and ran b.19 i use to go to air shows but not anymore , things like activities , my son went to the v8 ’ sthe other weekend and i really wanted to go but i knew i wouldn ’ t be able to stand the noise all day b.20 i ’ ve had to let go of my dream to do my phd and working internationally as an environmental consultant ... . i ’ ve lost my job as a teacher b.21 i stopped going to church because it was just too hard , with the singing ... .um it was very hard ... .because it made ... it made the frustration greater , and going to church and having the community kind of prayer , um , was an avenue that was closed to me b.22 it means to me ultimately pain , um , because certainly in the early days i was so sensitive to any noise that i had to wear um ear plugs if i wanted to leave the house at all b.23 and it ’ s like god , i just want to sleep and you can ’ t ; it ’ s like you ’ re not in control of your own brain b.24 but cause my filters have been kind of out of whack um you hear it all and it ’ s really hard for you to shut any of it out , no control b.25 noise probably is a far stronger one , far far stronger than light , because i feel like i can control light more , and easier than noise , ... . that it ’ s far harder to control noise cause there ’ s so many outlining factors that you can ’ t even , remotely touch on b.26 it ’ s the conglomeration of noise and i find i just get overloaded to the point where i just want to escape from it ... .. i would go to the furthest corner of the library away from everyone and i could still hear it b.27 it ’ s like um your living in a world through ... .with micro/speakerphones strapped to each side of your head , like sometimes it ’ s just so much it ’ s , you just can ’ t get away from it b.28 you can ’ t choose the sound you want to hear , it ’ s just everything magnified ... .where ever you are b.29 like i walked to the shops um mt albert and i should have got a cab but i was like , at that stage , i was like nah i wan na walk , i wan na actually be able to do something myself ... . i ended up walking with my fingers in my ears b.30 i need to think about where you ’ re going , so if i ’ m going somewhere i might think better take ear plugs as it might be too loud and like to be able to drive or have an exit plan b.31 it ’ s shouting ( shopping ) , and it feels , to me it feels like it ’ s really shouting so i learnt that to go shopping either late in the evenings or early in the morning b.32 i like to go to cafes but my friends and i will only go to one that is quieter , or where we can actually get to a quieter place b.33 um apparently i was a neurotic house wife and i had to go home and get over it ... that was the first assessment i got b.34 like i used to ask , cause my door is right by the front door and i ’ d ask them could they leave out the back door , cause they wouldn ’ t understand why would going out the front door be an issue b.35 there was a boy in front of us who kept talking to somebody and it felt like shouting , shouting for no reason and to the point he got me so angry appendix c a summary of research undertaken on wind turbine noise * preamble there are now a number of studies showing that turbine noise is annoying , and that there is a link between annoyance to turbine noise and health as defined by the who . a brief description of this evidence is now listed , and where possible , technical jargon has been omitted or minimised . it should be noted that , without exception , all of these studies have shortcomings , and indeed , research of this type is vulnerable to inherent limitations that serve to dampen its impact . however , the studies selected represent credible researchers undertaking difficult research . harry ( 2007 ) dr amanda harry , a british general practitioner , conducted surveys of 42 residents living near several different turbine sites and reported a similar constellation of symptoms from all sites . of the 42 respondents , 81 % felt their health had been affected , in 76 % it was sufficiently severe to consult a doctor and 73 % felt their quality of life had been adversely impacted . this study is open to criticism for a design that invited symptom reporting and was not controlled . while the proportion of those affected may be questioned it nevertheless indicates strongly that some members of the public are severely affected by wind turbine noise at distances thought by governments and industry to be safe . harry , a . ( 2007 ) , wind turbines , noise and health . retrieved from : http : //www.flat-group.co.uk/pdf/wtnoise_health_2007_a_barry.pdf pederson et al . , ( 2003 , 2004 , 2007 , 2008 and 2009 ) pedersen and co-investigators have undertaken a series of investigations examining the relationship between turbine noise and health . in a 2004 paper ( n =351 ) pedersen reports the importance of individual and contextual factors alongside noise parameters , and the danger in generalising findings from other sources of community noise ( e.g . , road , rail , aircraft ) to the wind turbine context ( see figure 3.0 , mainbody ) . in a 2007 paper ( n =754 ) , pederson further explores these individual and contextual influences . they noted that those living in rural areas are more likely to be annoyed than those from suburban areas , and that those living in complex terrain ( e.g . , hills or rocky terrain ) were more likely to be annoyed than those living on flat ground . the study found a strong association between annoyance and both lowered sleep quality and negative emotions . a paper published in 2008 ( n =1822 ) reanalysed pre-existing turbine noise and annoyance data and concluded that turbine noise can impede health , especially for susceptible individuals . the paper also discussed the dangers of using noise level as a sole predictor of annoyance , and the strength of noise sensitivity indices in predicting annoyance . pedersen and others ( 2009 ) reported that annoyance increased with increasing sound levels , both indoors and outdoors ( see table 1 ) . the proportions who were rather and very annoyed at different sound levels are shown in table i. in summary , when outside , 18 % were rather or very annoyed at sound levels of 35-40 and 40-45 db ( a ) compared to 7 % at 30-35 db ( a ) and 2 % at < 30 db ( a ) . when inside , the equivalent figures were 1 % at < 30 db ( a ) , 4 % at 30-35 db ( a ) , 8 % at 35-40 db ( a ) and 18 % at 40-45 db ( a ) . those respondents who had an economic interest in the turbines had lower levels of annoyance while negative views of the visual impact of turbines increased the likelihood of annoyance . although the authors do not seek to recommend minimum sound levels , they do note that turbine noise was more annoying than other sources , with the possible exception of railway shunting yards and was more noticeable at night . reported associations between annoyance and symptoms of stress ( headache , tiredness , tension and irritability ) confirmed that “ annoyance ” is more than irritation and is a marker of impaired health . they conclude that ( pedersen et al , 2009 ) : “ ... night time conditions should be treated as crucial in recommendations for wind turbine noise limits . ” nevertheless , it is clear from this analysis that external predicted turbine sound levels should be less than 35 db ( a ) , considerably less than those permitted by european noise standards , in order to reduce effects on nearby residents to acceptable levels . table 1 : percent responding to level of annoyance towards outdoor and indoor wind turbine noise levels for five categories of level in 5-db ( a ) sound level intervals . parentheses present 95 % confidence intervals .

town of ridgeville wind ordinance town of ridgeville wind energy conversion systems ordinance the town board of the town of ridgeville , county of monroe , state of wisconsin , ordains as follows : i. general provisions a. title . these regulations shall officially be known , cited and referred to as the wind energy conversion systems ( wecs ) ordinance of the town of ridgeville , and hereinafter will be referred to as “ the ordinance . ” b. findings . under state law , electric generating facilities of less than 100 megawatts ( “ mw ” ) are subject to regulations enacted by counties and local units of government . the town of ridgeville is under the monroe county zoning and wind energy system ordinance , which regulates such facilities . however , the monroe county zoning and wind energy system ordinance has insufficient standards to protect the public health and safety of the residents and property owners of the town of ridgeville . therefore , this town of ridgeville licensing ordinance has been adopted under the town of ridgeville ’ s town and village powers and wis. stat . § 66.0401. the town finds that wind energy systems which may be constructed and operated in the town require special licensing by the town in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed by monroe county , in order to protect the public health and safety of town residents and property owners . in this regard , the town finds that the report issued by the national research council entitled environmental impacts of wind-energy projects , may 2007 ( “ 2007 nrc report ” ) , addresses several important public health and safety issues relative to wecs that require regulation by the town . the town further finds that the provisions of the “ draft model wind ordinance for wisconsin , ” as promoted by the state of wisconsin ’ s department of administration , are inadequate to reasonably protect public health and safety . c. purposes and i ntent . the purposes and intent of this ordinance are to protect the public health and safety of the residents and property owners of the town of ridgeville who may be affected by the development and operation of wecs . such purposes and intent shall be accomplished by regulating noise , protecting emergency communications , regulating shadow flicker , ensuring adequate fire protection , establishing adequate setbacks , protecting

how site selection affects wind farm construction

selecting a wind farm site is complex , time consuming , and involves multiple disciplines working on parallel paths . financing , government permits , meteorological studies , land use restrictions , and design has to be completed or well along before a site is approved and before construction can begin . however , it is imperative in all of the above-referenced steps that construction expertise be involved and consulted to achieve maximum use of the approved site . there are three principle sources of construction expertise generally participating in wind farm projects . they are the design team responsible for conceptual and eventual site design , the developer or construction manager of the project , and the wind turbine generator contractor . wind farm developers should include on their initial concept and development team people with expertise in site design and wind farm construction , regardless of whether those people ultimately end up working on the wind farm construction . after conceptual approval and financing , expertise should be added to the team regarding the selection and operation of wind turbine generators . this expertise will allow the non-construction professionals on the project team to understand the limitations of various wind turbine designs , the site specific issues that may affect the layout and operation of the wind farm , and the scheduling , civil engineering , and electrical issues that will affect actual wind farm construction .

wind is big and wind is heavy . these two factors introduce unique considerations to the construction of a wind farm that differ from the construction of other power generation facilities . big and heavy will contribute to the determination of an appropriate site , will determine the schedule for constructing the wind farm , and will contribute additional costs to transportation , site preparation , construction , and commissioning . when selecting the appropriate site for construction a wind farm , scheduling consideration should be given to accessing the site and to constructing the site . integral to both of these site selection concerns is the preoperational project schedule . development of a wind farm generally takes from 2 to 5 years with construction taking more or less than a year depending upon decisions made in the development phase . one of the key decisions that can affect the construction schedule would be the lead time in ordering the wind turbine generators selected for the project . to the layperson , all wind turbines may look the same , but that is not reflective of reality . turbine design , turbine dimensions , turbine weights , and turbine

manufacturing locations all affect the construction of a wind farm . another unique factor affecting project schedule and costs is the transportation and road system that exists between the wind turbine generator manufacturing point and the wind farm site . the excessive weight of a wind turbine nacelle and the excessive lengths of the wind turbine blades and tower segments require special attention to transporting the wind turbine generator to the wind farm site . special vehicles are required to transport wind turbine

components . roads have to be selected that can adequately bear the load of wind turbine parts . the transportation route has to be selected with adequate turning radii to accommodate the wind turbine part dimensions and with adequate vertical clearances to allow wind turbine parts to pass under bridges , signs , power lines , and other overhead obstacles .

these transportation concerns are generally addressed in the site selection and design process and any associated roadway improvement costs are the equivalent of preparation costs often borne by the project owner or developer . the wind turbine generator manufacturer can provide assistance in analyzing the suitability of the transportation to the project site as can an engineering , procurement , and construction ( epc ) contractor . site soil composition and the presence of rock are issues that will affect construction methods and costs . site soil composition has to be reviewed to determine its tolerance for placement of tower foundations , roads , and crane pads . rock located on the wind farm site needs to be evaluated to determine if it is suitable for use as aggregate for foundations of roadways and crane pads on the site . the availability of aggregate onsite and the ability to quarry the aggregate for onsite construction purposes eliminates costs associated with both acquiring quarry from another location or entity and transporting that aggregate to the site . however , the location of suitable aggregate may otherwise impede construction by restricting or limiting access to the jobsite . thus , the soil condition and availability of aggregate on a wind farm site may trigger construction costs of compensating for inadequate soil , purchasing necessary aggregate , or overcoming potential delays or inefficiencies in the actual construction attributable to mining and moving aggregate onsite . electrical issues are also different in the construction of a wind farm . an electrical substation is required to receive power from each tower and then to step up the wind generated voltage to match the voltage in the power grid . substation placement optimally should be central to the majority of towers on the site . underground wiring should be used to connect each tower to the substation . the underground power systems should be designed to dissipate heat build-up so as not to damage the cables or affect their design life during transmission of the wind

generated power to the substation . also , cables to monitor individual tower performance and any other tower control cables should be trenched where possible between each tower and the wind farm operational control building . site configuration will determine where to place the operational control building , but it is normally placed near the main entrance to the wind farm . it is important at this point to distinguish in the construction process between the wind turbine generator and the civil and electrical works . in the construction process , the supplier of the wind turbine generator is responsible for providing the tower , the blades , the hub , the nose cone , and the power unit . the supplier of the wind turbine generator is also usually responsible for the supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) system and can also be responsible for the provision of an initial spare part inventory and the possible design of any desired maintenance facilities . the wind turbine supplier is also usually responsible to commission the operation of the wind turbines to demonstrate achievement of the stated performance criteria . it is important to point out that there is no standard definition of commissioning except for what is provided by contract or by technical data sheet provided by the wind turbine supplier . however , the

electrical infrastructure can be tested by reliance on standard electrical tests recognized in the industry or required by applicable codes . commissioning is necessary to commence the wind turbine warranty . warranties generally run from two to five years and cover lost revenue , downtime to correct faults , and an evaluation of the power curve . a wind turbine power curve is a graph indicating the individual turbine ’ s electrical power output for operation at different wind speeds . the power curve is generally determined by local wind field measurements . failure to achieve power curve standards is often addressed in a contract by the imposition of liquidated damages .

the wind farm civil works and electrical works are usually referred to as the balance of plant ( bop ) and are provided by a contractor different from the wind turbine supplier . bop civil engineering scopes of work include roads and drainage , crane pads , turbine foundation , meteorological mast foundations , and buildings for electrical switch gear , scada equipment , and a maintenance/spare part facility . bop electrical work scopes include point of connection equipment to feed the wind farm ’ s power generation into the electrical grid , underground cable networks and overhead transmission lines , electrical switch gear to protect and/or disconnect turbines or other equipment from the system , transformers and switches for individual turbines unless located within the turbine and provided by the turbine supplier , and grounding and connections for control rooms , maintenance facilities , and any other buildings onsite . this difference in responsibility between the wind turbine supplier and the bop contractor is the topic of some debate regarding selection of the proper project delivery system for a wind farm . project developers generally use epc contractors as the entity to design a wind farm project and manage construction through the commissioning phase . the epc contractor would be responsible for contracting with the wind turbine supplier and with any bop contractors . however , this arrangement exposes the epc contractor to damages should the wind turbine fail from a performance or delivery perspective . additionally , the wind turbine generator represents a high percentage of project costs without provision of an appropriate markup available to the epc contractor . that is because the wind turbine is commonly shipped , erected , and commissioned by the wind turbine supplier and not by epc contractor personnel . thus , epc contractors have begun to perceive a disproportionate risk/reward ratio in contracting with the turbine supplier , encouraging some movement to a project delivery system where the

developer contracts with the wind turbine supplier directly , instead of through the epc contractor . construction issues related to wind farm site selection are also affected by other issues unique to the selected parcel . construction may be affected by land use restrictions or zoning issues , such as hunting rights , grazing rights , and cultural issues . additionally , wildlife issues may restrict construction due to bird or bat migration , wildlife migration , spawning issues , wetlands and surface water issues . last , noise or visual obstruction restrictions may affect placement of turbines or hours of construction operation . construction of wind turbine farms is greatly affected by site selection . though these issues are relatively new in the united states , there are well developed practices within the wind turbine and wind farm industries developed in other countries and adopted within the united states to address constructability concerns . so , despite all of the publicity related to wind farm site selection regarding zoning , permitting , environmental concerns , and community reaction , the construction industry is capable of constructing a wind farm in the face of multiple site specific issues .

embrace the revolution – myths and facts of wind energy wind energy myths and facts myth : tens of thousands of wind turbines will be cluttering the british countryside fact : government legislation requires that by 2010 , 10 % of electricity supply must come from renewable sources . wind power is currently the most cost effective renewable energy technology in a position to help do that . around 3,500 additional modern wind turbines are all that would be needed to deliver 8 % of the uk ’ s electricity by 2010 , roughly 2,000 onshore and 1,500 offshore . myth : wind farms won ’ t help climate change fact : wind power is a clean , renewable source of energy which produces no greenhouse gas emissions or waste products . the uk currently emits 560 million tonnes of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) , the key greenhouse gas culprit , every year and the government target is to cut this by 60 % by 2050 . power stations are the largest contributor to carbon emissions , producing 170 million tonnes of co2 each year . we need to switch to forms of energy that do not produce co2 . just one modern wind turbine will save over 4,000 tonnes of co2 emissions annually . myth : building a wind farm takes more energy than it ever makes fact : the average wind farm will pay back the energy used in its manufacture within 3-5 months of operation . this compares favourably with coal or nuclear power stations , which take about six months . a modern wind turbine is designed to operate for more than 20 years and at the end of its working life , the area can be restored at low financial and environmental costs . wind energy is a form of development which is essentially reversible – in contrast to fossil fuel or nuclear power stations . myth : wind farms are inefficient and only work 30 % of the time fact : a modern wind turbine produces electricity 70-85 % of the time , but it generates different outputs depending on the wind speed . over the course of a year , it will typically generate about 30 % of the theoretical maximum output . this is known as its load factor . the load factor of conventional power stations is on average 50 % . a modern wind turbine will generate enough to meet the electricity demands of more than a thousand homes over the course of a year . myth : wind energy needs back-up to work fact : all forms of power generation require back up and no energy technology can be relied upon 100 % . the uk ’ s transmission system already operates with enough back-up to manage the instantaneous loss of a large power station . variations in the output from wind farms are barely noticeable over and above the normal fluctuation in supply and demand , seen when the nation ’ s workforce goes home , or if lightning brings down a high-voltage transmission line . therefore , at present there is no need for additional back-up because of wind energy . even for wind power to provide 10 % of our nation ’ s electricity needs , only a small amount of additional conventional back-up would be required , in the region of 300-500 megawatts ( mw ) . this would add only 0.2 pence per kilowatt hour to the generation cost of wind energy and would not in any way threaten the security of our grid . in fact , this is unlikely to become a significant issue until wind generates over 20 % of total electricity supply . myth : installing wind farms will never shut down power stations fact : the simple fact is that power plants in the uk are being shut down , either through european legislation on emissions or sheer old age . we need to act now to find replacement power sources : wind is an abundant resource , indigenous to the uk and therefore has a vital role to play in the new energy portfolio . myth : wind power is expensive fact : the cost of generating electricity from wind has fallen dramatically over the past few years . between 1990 and 2002 , world wind energy capacity doubled every three years and with every doubling prices fell by 15 % . wind energy is competitive with new coal and new nuclear capacity , even before any environmental costs of fossil fuel and nuclear generation are taken into account . the average cost of generating electricity from onshore wind is now around 3-4p per kilowatt hour , competitive with new coal ( 2.5-4.5p ) and cheaper than new nuclear ( 4-7p ) . as gas prices increase and wind power costs fall – both of which are very likely – wind becomes even more competitive , so much so that some time after 2010 wind should challenge gas as the lowest cost power source . furthermore , wind is a free and widely available fuel source , therefore once the wind farm is in place , there are no fuel or waste related costs . myth : the uk should invest in other renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency instead of wind power fact : wind energy ’ s role in combating climate change is not a matter of either/or . the uk will need a mix of new and existing renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency measures , and as quickly as possible . significant amounts of investment have been allocated for wave and tidal energy development , and these technologies , along with solar and biomass energy , will have an important role in the uk ’ s future energy mix . however , wind energy is the most cost effective renewable energy technology available to generate clean electricity and help combat climate change right now . furthermore , developing a strong wind industry will facilitate other renewable technologies which have not reached commercialisation yet , accumulating valuable experience in dealing with issues such as grid connection , supply chain and finance . myth : wind farms should all be put out at sea fact : we will need a mix of both onshore and offshore wind energy to meet the uk ’ s challenging targets on climate change . at present , onshore wind is more economical than development offshore . however , more offshore wind farms are now under construction , with the first of the large-scale projects operational at the end of 2003 , and prices will fall as the industry gains more experience . furthermore , offshore wind farms take longer to develop , as the sea is inherently a more hostile environment . to expect offshore to be the only form of wind generation allowed would therefore be to condemn us to missing our renewable energy targets and commitment to tackle climate change . myth : wind farms are ugly and unpopular fact : beauty is in the eye of the beholder , and whether you think a wind turbine is attractive or not will always be your personal opinion . however , studies regularly show that most people find turbines an interesting feature of the landscape . on average 80 % of the public support wind energy , less than 10 % are against it , with the remainder undecided . surveys conducted since the early 1990s across the country near existing wind farms have consistently found that most people are in favour of wind energy , with support increasing among those living closer to the wind farms . myth : wind farms negatively affect tourism fact : there is no evidence to suggest this . the uk ’ s first commercial wind farm at delabole received 350,000 visitors in its first ten years of operation , while 10,000 visitors a year come to take the turbine tour at the ecotech centre in swaffham , norfolk . a mori poll in scotland showed that 80 % of tourists would be interested in visiting a wind farm . wind farm developers are often asked to provide visitor centres , viewing platforms and rights of way to their sites . myth : wind farms harm property prices fact : there is currently no evidence in the uk showing that wind farms impact negatively upon house prices . however , there is evidence following a comprehensive study by the scottish executive that those living nearest to wind farms are their strongest advocates . myth : wind farms kill birds fact : the rspb stated in its 2004 information leaflet wind farms and birds , that “ in the uk , we have not so far witnessed any major adverse effects on birds associated with wind farms ” . wind farms are always subject to an environmental impact assessment and bwea members follow the industry ’ s best practice guidelines and work closely with organisations such as english nature and the rspb to ensure that wind farm design and layout does not interfere with sensitive species or wildlife designated sites . moreover , a recent report published in the journal nature confirmed that the greatest threat to bird populations in the uk is climate change . myth : wind farms are dangerous to humans fact : wind energy is a benign technology with no associated emissions , harmful pollutants or waste products . in over 25 years and with more than 68,000 machines installed around the world , no member of the public has ever been harmed by the normal operation of wind turbines . in response to recent unscientific accusations that wind turbines emit infrasound and cause associated health problems , dr geoff leventhall , consultant in noise vibration and acoustics and author of the defra report on low frequency noise and its effects , says : “ i can state quite categorically that there is no significant infrasound from current designs of wind turbines . to say that there is an infrasound problem is one of the hares which objectors to wind farms like to run . there will not be any effects from infrasound from the turbines . ” myth : wind farms are noisy fact : the evolution of wind farm technology over the past decade has rendered mechanical noise from turbines almost undetectable with the main sound being the aerodynamic swoosh of the blades passing the tower . there are strict guidelines on wind turbines and noise emissions to ensure the protection of residential amenity . these are contained in the scientifically informed etsu working group guidelines 1996 and must be followed by wind farm developers , as referenced in national planning policy for renewables . the best advice for any doubter is to go and hear for yourself ! note the ‘ average modern wind turbine ’ referred to in this document has a rated capacity of 1.8 megawatts ( mw ) onshore . data on consented projects and applications currently being progressed shows that this will increase to over 2 mw in the near future . offshore , turbines currently being installed are rated at 3 mw , and it is expected that this will rise to a typical 5 mw per machine by 2010. references energy white paper ( 2003 ) , our energy

howe gastmeier chapnik limited ( hgc engineering ) was retained by natural resources canada to assess the environmental noise impact from the pubnico point wind farm in nova scotia . the pubnico point wind farm has been operating seventeen vestas 1.8 mw wind turbine generators on the southern tip of the point for the past year . residences are located north of the wind farm , along highway 335. a residential neighbour , mr. daniel d ’ entremont , has expressed concerns regarding the sound impacting his property , which is adjacent to the wind farm and about 330 metres from the closest wind turbine generators . his concerns relate to the audibility of the sound produced by the wind turbine generators , particularly when the wind is from the south as noted in an undated letter to department of natural resources canada : “ when light to moderate winds are blowing the noise towards our house it is at its loudest . sometimes the fog seems to amplify the noise ” . during discussions on site , mr. d ’ entremont also expressed concerns about the potential for adverse effects of infrasound - pressure fluctuations at a frequency below that which the human ear can discern - due to the operation of the wind turbine generators . engineers from hgc engineering visited the site during the period from may 5 to 11 , 2006 to measure the sound impact of the wind turbine generators at the residence most impacted by the wind farm , at another residential location further to the north , and within the wind farm . the acoustical measurements were conducted using a number of techniques including longer-term monitoring of the overall a-weighted decibel level , detailed real time frequency analysis in 1/3 octaves bands , and discrete frequency spectral analysis . measurements were conducted over the typical audible frequency range and in the infrasonic range . records of wind conditions were obtained through the pubnico point wind farm , and supplemented with environment canada data from yarmouth .

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page 2 natural resources canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august 23 , 2006 acoustical modelling was completed to correlate the levels measured at various points of reception to sound power data estimated from measurements conducted near the wind turbine generators . the measured and modelled results have been compared to the criteria presented in the ontario ministry of the environment ’ s ( moe ) publications npc-232 sound level limits for stationary sources in class 3 areas ( rural ) and interpretation of applying moe npc technical publications to wind turbine generators . additional guidelines for assessing and investigating noise from wind turbine generators have been obtained from various international technical papers . the ontario guidelines are used in this assessment since the province of nova scotia does not presently publish technical guidelines for assessing the acoustic impact of wind turbine generators on residences . the results of the monitoring indicate that the sound of the operating wind turbine generators is clearly audible at the residence of mr. daniel d ’ entremont ( hereafter , the d ’ entremont residence ) , and confirm mr. d ’ entremont ’ s impression that the impact is greatest when the winds are from the south and the humidity is high . data from the automatic sound level monitor deployed at the d ’ entremont residence indicates that , much of the time , the sound levels are not significantly above the typical background sound level expected at the particular wind speed . however , the data also indicates that the sound level from the wind turbine generators can exceed the background sound level in the area by up to 13 db under certain wind and atmospheric conditions , most notably light winds from the south . at the d ’ entremont residence , the dominant acoustic impact of the wind turbine generators takes the form of a constantly repeated ‘ swoosh ’ noise produced by the rotating turbine blades . the sound is relatively broadband , with no clear tonal characteristics , and the amplitude is modulated at the blade passing frequency of 0.8 hz . the ‘ swoosh ’ makes identification of the wind turbine generator sound fairly easy , and observations and the measurements indicate that the impact of the wind farm is continually audible to varying degrees depending on operational and atmospheric conditions .

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page 3 natural resources canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august 23 , 2006 sound at infrasonic frequencies is not present at perceptible levels near the wind turbine generators nor at the d ’ entremont residence and it is concluded that infrasound is not an issue . this conclusion agrees with internationally recognized research on the low frequency sound produced by wind turbine generators . an analytical assessment of the impact suggests that the sound levels produced by the wind farm do not exceed the applicable criterion of the ontario ministry of the environment ( moe ) . however , this conclusion is based on assessment methodologies appropriate under the standards , although it relies on an estimate of the wind turbine generator sound power at a single wind speed of about 9 m/s rather than on the manufacturer ’ s sound power data for all wind speeds , as specified by the standard . the moe evaluation procedure relies on a model of acoustic dispersion which is generally favourable for the propagation of sound from a source to a receptor , but does not consider specific environmental conditions or effects , and does not purport to define a sound level impact under a worst-case atmospheric condition . an expanded predictive assessment , undertaken by hgc engineering to investigate the influence of specific atmospheric and wind conditions in greater detail , confirms that the operation of the wind turbine generators can contribute to sound levels exceeding the applicable criteria , although such a prediction methodology is outside the approach prescribed by the moe . in conclusion , the sound of the wind turbine generators is continually audible at the d ’ entremont residence , but much of the time is not appreciably above the numeric criteria derived under the guidelines of the ontario ministry of the environment . however , under certain wind and atmospheric conditions – most notably when there are light winds from the south and the humidity is high – the sound level impact of the wind turbine generators is significantly greater than the background sound levels .

the site of the wind farm , illustrated in figure 1 , is located at the south end of pubnico point , yarmouth county , nova scotia , south of the town of west pubnico . highway 335 is the one road running through the area , aligned toward the east side of the point . the road also provides the access to the wind farm . the west side of the point is largely undeveloped , and is heavily forested . the seventeen wind turbine generators installed at the wind farm are arranged in a roughly gridlike pattern , about 360 metres from one another . the wind turbine generators themselves are vestas v80 1.8 mw units , with a hub height of 80 metres , and a rotor diameter of 80 metres . the three-bladed wind turbine generators do not operate at wind speeds below 5 m/s or above 25 m/s , and are designed to rotate at about 16 rpm across the full operating range . additional vestas technical data is attached to this report as appendix a. during the site visit , sixteen of the seventeen wind turbine generators were operational . wind turbine generator number 17 was being rebuilt and did not operate . as this wind turbine generator is located on the far west side of the wind farm , this has no impact on the conclusions presented in this report . residences are located on either side of highway 335 , north of the site . the d ’ entremont residence is the most impacted residence , and is located about 330 metres from the closest wind turbine generators .

fundamentally , the approach used in this assessment is to combine direct measurements of the impact of the wind turbine generators at the most impacted receptor ( the d ’ entremont residence ) with modelling of the impact over a wider variety of receptor locations . the site visit and measurements were conducted during a week-long sample period , selected well in advance of the visit . bad weather occurred toward the end of the sample period , including near gale-force winds and rain . thus the measurements which were conducted between friday may 5 and wednesday may 10 , 2006 , are presented herein . during this period there were sufficient variations in wind speed and direction to allow a meaningful assessment . to investigate the acoustic impact of the wind turbine generators , an automated sound level monitor was installed in the rear yard area of the d ’ entremont residence , configured to continuously measure and record overall a-weighted sound levels . the automatically collected data spanning the period recorded sound levels under a variety of weather conditions , including a period of calm , a period of light winds from the south , and a period of near gale-force winds . this provided a good representative sampling of atmospheric conditions , although the range was not exhaustive . weather conditions recorded at yarmouth ( about 36 km northwest of west pubnico ) are provided in appendix b. attended measurements , obtained using a real-time frequency analyzer , were also conducted in the area after representatives of hgc engineering spoke with mr. d ’ entremont to ensure that his concerns were understood . mr. d ’ entremont had previously indicated in an undated letter to the department of natural resources canada that his concerns centred on the audibility of the wind turbine generators :

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page 6 natural resources canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august 23 , 2006 the noise is unbearable . it is a constant 24 hour a day intrusion . the noise can not be ignored… the environmental assessment stated that the wind farm would be inaudible at 300 m. when light to moderate winds are blowing the noise towards our house it is at its loudest . sometimes the fog seems to amplify the noise . there are many foggy days in pubnico as stated in the environment assessment . when the wind is coming from the north west which is blowing the noise away from our house , we hear an echo creating noise from two directions at once . whenever we step outside , the noise is as though we were entering storm conditions . when the wind is strong , the noise of the wind in the trees helps to drown out the windmills but we can always distinguish windmill noise from the natural noise of the environment . sometimes i think the noise is louder at our house than it is amongst the windmills . during the site visit , mr. d ’ entremont also discussed concerns regarding potential adverse health effects of sound at infrasonic frequencies . attended measurements , including spectral sound level measurements in the form of both 1/3 octave band spectra and narrowband spectra were conducted as well as waterfall type measurements recording the variation over time of each measurement frequency band . both aweighted sound level measurements and un-weighted sound level measurements were conducted as appropriate , and measurements over the audible frequency ranges as well as at infrasonic frequencies were made . acoustical measurements were conducted at the d ’ entremont residence , and at a variety of other locations throughout the area near the wind farm , including a comparatively remote location to establish typical background sound levels , and within the wind farm itself to approximately determine the sound power level of a wind turbine generator under a specific wind speed . the automated measurements were made using a bruel and kjaer type 2236 integrating sound level meter . attended measurements were conducted with a hewlett packard type 3569a real

there are no specific technical guidelines for assessing the acoustic impact of wind turbine generators on residential properties published by the province of nova scotia . consequently natural resources canada suggested that the noise guidelines of the ontario ministry of the environment ( moe ) form the basis of this assessment . as the moe guidelines describe a comprehensive approach to the measurement and assessment of industrial noise in general , and cover wind turbine generators specifically , these guidelines were adopted as the primary basis of this assessment . the moe guidelines are available at the ministry website.1 specifically , moe guideline npc-232 sound level limits for stationary sources in class 3 areas ( rural ) provides general assessment guidelines for industrial noise impacting a sensitive land use such as a residential area in an acoustically rural location . an acoustically rural area has sound levels generally dominated by natural sounds , other than the industrial noise source under consideration . during site visits conducted by hgc engineering , it was clear that most of the time , the background sound at the residences in the vicinity of the wind farm are indeed set by natural sounds such as the wind acting on trees , birds , etc . the moe guidelines consider one-hour energy equivalent average sound levels ( designated as leq ) , rather than instantaneous sound levels , in units of a-weighted decibels ( dba ) . the human ear has a sensitivity to the loudness of sound which varies depending on the frequency of a sound , and is most sensitive around 1000 hertz ( hz ) . the a-weighting system is used to approximate this varying sensitivity . npc-232 indicates that the applicable sound level limit for a stationary source of sound is the background sound level . however , where background sound levels are low , exclusionary

this publication specifies an analytical method of assessment ; the manufacturers sound power data is used as input to a model which predicts the acoustic impact at a point of reception over a full range of wind speeds . the publication further specifies that the calculation methodology of iso 9613-2 , acoustics-attenuation of sound during propagation outdoors be used . iso 9613-2 yields a receptor sound level under a single assumed propagation condition that does not reflect a realistic meteorological situation , but is generally favourable to the propagation of sound from a source to a receptor ( essentially a moderate downwind condition in all directions ) . iso 9613-2

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page 10 natural resources canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august 23 , 2006 does not describe a method for predicting sound levels under a specific meteorological condition , nor does it purport to define a sound level impact under a worst-case atmospheric condition . the moe guidelines do not contain specific assessment or measurement methodologies for noise at infrasonic frequencies , as acoustic problems involving infrasound are not common . infrasound is sound at low frequencies , and is not otherwise different from common higherfrequency sound . iso defines infrasound as “ sound or noise whose frequency spectrum lies mainly in the band from 1 hz to 20 hz . ” natural sources of infrasound include wind and breaking waves ; people are continually subject to sound at infrasonic frequencies . however , the human ear is not particularly sensitive to sound at these frequencies , and we are generally not subject to sufficiently high levels of infrasound to detect its presence . various papers and reports dealing with low frequency noise in general , and investigations of low frequency noise produced by wind turbine generators in particular have been published in recent years . perception thresholds , below which infrasound is generally not discerned have been suggested by various papers including berglund and hassmen2 and watanabe and møller3 . these are summarized in figure 2. it is generally understood that imperceptible sound levels , including sound at infrasonic frequencies , do not cause health problems . the assessment of the infrasound near the wind turbine generators and at the d ’ entremont residence has been based on several of these papers .

automatic sound level measurements the data gathered by the automatic sound level monitor is shown in figure 3 , together with related wind data and criteria . appendix c summarizes the figure 3 data in tabular form . the figure contains five datasets , and the type of information represented by each dataset is described below : dataset 1 – the first dataset is the energy equivalent average leq sound levels in 10 minute intervals , shown on figure 3 in red . the appropriate amplitude information , in units of a-weighted decibels , is provided on the left hand side vertical axis , also in red . dataset 2 – the second dataset is the wind speed information measured by an anemometer at the 80 metre high hub of wind turbine generator number 14 , which is one of the wind turbine generators closest to the residence . this dataset is shown in figure 3 in green , and the appropriate scale , displaying wind speed in units of m/s , is shown on the right hand side vertical axis , in green . dataset 3 – the third dataset is the wind speed measured at the meteorological station tower shown on figure 1 , and is shown in blue . the appropriate amplitude information is the right hand side vertical axis . dataset 4 – the fourth dataset is shown on the chart in gray , and represents the wind speed-dependant criteria derived under interpretation . dataset 5 – the fifth dataset ( the heavy intermittent black line ) represents periods during which the winds were from the south , southwest , or southeast . figure 3 has been divided into three time periods , as indicated at the top of the figure . the periods are illustrated individually in figures 3a through 3c . the periods , and the conditions occurring during each period are described below . period 1 – during this interval , stretching from the late afternoon on may 5 until the night of may 6 , the winds were light , near the cut-in point of the wind turbine generators , and generally from the south , with high humidity and periods of fog . there was a brief period of calm during the evening on may 6. when calm , the sound levels dropped

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page 12 natural resources canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august 23 , 2006 briefly below 30 dba . measured sound levels during the late evening periods on may 5 and 6 increased to 53 dba , exceeding the sound level criteria of interpretation by up to 13 dba . period 2 – during this interval , lasting until the evening of may 8 , the winds were somewhat higher for much of the period , and were for the most part from the west , north , or northwest . lower humidity levels were also present through this period . measured sound levels tracked the criterion of interpretation quite closely . several elevated sound levels of greater than 60 dba were measured for short intervals during this period . the time at which these events correlates with activities on the d ’ entremont property such as lawn mowing , a conclusion determined through discussion with mr. d ’ entremont and others . these occurrences can be safely discounted from consideration . toward the end of period 2 , wind were briefly from the south , but the sound level did not increase as noted in period 1 , possibly since the humidity was low . period 3 – this interval initially saw winds largely from the west with low wind speeds , at which time measured sound levels were in excess of the criteria of interpretation by a modest amount , and then saw winds rise to near gale force levels , with rain . the data during this period was highly influenced by the wind and rain and is of limited use . a forecast of continuing strong winds and rain caused the measurements to be curtailed . the key points indicated by the data in the figure are discussed below . 1 ) most of the time , typical sound levels at the residence are directly proportional to wind speed , suggesting that the approach of moe publication interpretation ( i.e . , that the assessment criteria should vary with wind speed ) is appropriate . the proportionality is particularly strong during the “ second period ” portion of the graph . 2 ) at low wind speeds , i.e . , at wind speeds below the cut-in point of the wind turbine generators ( 5 m/s ) , background sound can fall significantly below 40 dba , supporting the

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page 13 natural resources canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august 23 , 2006 conclusion that the residences and wind farm are located in an acoustically rural area under moe guidelines . this is particularly clear during the calm interval in the “ first period ” where at about 20:00 on may 6 there was no wind and the sound levels briefly fell as low as 30 dba . 3 ) during much of the “ first period ” , the winds were generally from the southwest through south , at about 5 m/s , indicating that the wind turbine generators were near the cut-in limit of 5 m/s . high humidity levels also occurred during this period . during these conditions , at two distinct intervals ( between about 21:00 on may 5 to about 04:00 on may 6 , and again from about 21:00 on may 6 to 01:00 on may 7 ) the measured sound levels exceed the criteria of interpretation by a significant amount , peaking at an excess of 13 db . these periods agree well with mr. d ’ entremont ’ s observations . there are a number of potential hypotheses which could account for these excesses , but further efforts would be required to identify the precise cause . 4 ) much of the time , specifically the “ second period ” interval from about 02:00 on may 7th to about 12:00 on may 8th , the winds were generally in the range of 5 to 10 m/s , with varying wind directions but winds originating predominantly from the northwest through the east . during this period , and at the end of this period when the wind was from the south between 5 and 8 m/s , the measured sound levels were generally at the criteria of interpretation . it may be concluded that much of the time , the acoustic impact of the wind turbine generators is acceptable under interpretation . 5 ) during the “ third period ” the winds began to rise to near gale force , causing high background sound levels due to the action of the wind in the trees and other vegetation .

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page 14 natural resources canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august 23 , 2006 subjective audibility to assess the audibility of the wind turbine generators at the d ’ entremont residence , a variety of observations and acoustic measurements were conducted . figure 4a is based on a continuous series of 1/8 second duration spectral measurements made near the wind turbine generators . the horizontal axis represents a 20-second time window , and the vertical axis indicates frequency , which spanned from 25 hz to 5000 hz in this case . colour represents the a-weighted sound level , with warmer colours indicating higher levels . the vertical bands in the chart illustrate a repetitive ‘ swoosh ’ sound characteristic of wind turbine generators . the three-bladed wind turbines , rotating at about 16 rpm , have a blade pass frequency of about 0.8 hz . thus , over 20 seconds , about 16 ‘ swoosh ’ sounds would be expected , and can be seen in figure 4a . the influence of the ‘ swoosh ’ is clearest at midband frequencies , centred at about 1000 hz , where the amplitude modulates by about 5 db . it is important to realize that while the amplitude of sound in the typically audible range is modulated at a low frequency rate , this does not indicate or imply that the sound has acoustic content in this low frequency range . low frequency modulation of the sound levels should not be confused with low frequency sound . other than the ‘ swoosh ’ , the sound of the turbines was not observed to be appreciably tonal or to have other identifying characteristics . figure 4b illustrates a similar 20 second time period , but the measurement was conducted at the d ’ entremont residence . the influence of more than one wind turbine generators can be seen , in that there are more amplitude peaks than in figure 4a , but it is clear from the graph that the characteristic ‘ swoosh ’ sound is clearly discernable at the residence ; the sound of the wind turbine generators , while fairly broadband , is not continuous ‘ white ’ noise . during this measurement , as with the previous measurement , winds were from the northwest at approximately 10 m/s as measured at the closest wind turbine generators , which do not appear to be particularly favourable conditions for sound level impact of the wind turbine generators on the d ’ entremont residence . this demonstrates that even when the sound levels are at a relatively low magnitude , and in line with moe criteria , the sound is audible at the d ’ entremont residence .

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page 15 natural resources canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august 23 , 2006 in summary , the measurements and observations indicate that the sound of the wind turbine generators can be described as having the characteristic ‘ swoosh ’ sound typical of wind turbine generators . no tones or other identifying sounds were noted . the measurements and observations indicate that the wind turbine generators are continually audible at the d ’ entremont residence to varying degrees which depend on operational and atmospheric conditions . infrasound as stated previously in this report , wind and the action of waves generates infrasonic noise . infrasound is thus present throughout the environment , and can generally be measured anywhere . this observation is significant as it indicates that in the absence of the wind turbine generators , sound at infrasonic frequencies would still be present in the pubnico area . to provide an idea of the magnitude of infrasound in the area , measurements of sound at infrasonic frequencies were conducted near to an operating wind turbine generator and adjacent to the d ’ entremont residence . the measured sound spectra are illustrated in figure 5. as shown , the infrasonic sound near the wind turbine generator was low and not found to be appreciably different from that at the d ’ entremont residence . it can be concluded that the wind turbine generators are not the dominant source of infrasonic sound in the area . because of the broadband nature of the measured infrasound , a precise comparison of the measured spectra to the pure tone threshold of perception shown in with a dashed line in figure 5 can not be made . tones are easier for humans to identify than broadband sound , but no tones were observed . additionally , the measured levels are conservative in that they may be overstated due to wind-induced turbulence at the microphone . however , ignoring these influences , it is clear that the infrasound measured in the area near the pubnico point wind farm is well below the threshold of perception .

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page 16 natural resources canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august 23 , 2006 these findings agree well with the findings of a recent paper4 published in the journal of the canadian acoustical association , which concluded that “ infrasound from wind turbine generators is below the audible threshold and of no consequence . ” 6. modelling methodology and results

the moe standard interpretation is an analytical , prediction-based standard rather than an assessment method based on receptor measurements . it is not completely appropriate to compare a measured impact at a specific moment in time to a criterion determined under the standard , as the standard indicates that calculations be made using the assumed meteorological conditions of iso 9613-2 , acoustics – attenuation of sound during propagation outdoors – part 2 : general method of calculation which are generally favourable to the propagation of sound from a source to a receptor , but does not consider specific environmental conditions or effects , and does not purport to define a sound level impact under a worst-case atmospheric condition . to provide a more appropriate assessment of the impact of the pubnico point wind farm , hgc engineering has modelled the resulting noise impact at the residential receptors as described below . interpretation specifies that the source sound data to be used should be provided by the equipment manufacturer , and should be obtained according to iec 61400-11 , wind turbine generator systems – part 11 : acoustic noise measurement techniques . however , due to confidentiality concerns , the manufacturer ’ s data has not been used in this assessment . short-duration measurements were conducted on various sides of wind turbine generators number 1 and number 7 at a distance of 80 metres from the wind turbine generator tower in order to estimate the sound power of the wind turbine generators . the measurements occurred from about 10:30 to 11:00 on may 10 , and the wind speeds recorded during this period were about 10

hgc engineering visited west pubnico and the pubnico point wind farm in may 2006 to investigate the acoustic impact of the wind farm on the nearby residential receptors . a variety of acoustic measurements were conducted over a range of wind and environmental conditions . the measurements included continuous automatic noise monitoring at the residence of mr. daniel d ’ entremont . predictive acoustic modeling , based on on-site sound measurements , was also undertaken . the automatic sound level monitor data indicates that much of the time , the sound level impact of the wind turbine generators is not significantly greater than the criteria of the ontario ministry of the environment , specifically the criteria derived under publication interpretation for applying moe npc technical publications to wind turbine generators , which is based on typical background sound levels under different wind speeds . however , under certain wind and atmospheric conditions when background sound would be expected to be low , the measured sound levels were found to exceed the criteria and expected background sound by up to 13 db . in particular , sound levels were found to exceed the anticipated background sound during periods when winds were light and from the south , with high humidity . the sound of the operating wind turbine generators is continually audible at the most impacted points of reception , to varying degrees . no tones or other unusual attributes of the sound were noted or measured , other than the characteristic ‘ swoosh ’ of the moving blades . measurements made near the wind turbine generators , at the d ’ entremont residence , and at a remote location indicate sound at infrasonic frequencies below typical thresholds of perception ; infrasound is not an issue . acoustic modeling , undertaken to allow a more appropriate comparison of the acoustic impact of the wind turbine generators with the sound level criteria of moe publication interpretation for applying moe npc technical publications to wind turbine generators , indicate that the

environmental noise assessment , pubnico point wind farm page 20 natural resources canada contract nrcan-06-00046 august 23 , 2006 acoustic impact of the wind turbine generators complies with the criteria based on a sound power measured by hgc engineering under a 9 m/s wind speed . additional modelling indicates that , notwithstanding this compliance , there are environmental conditions when the sound level impact will be greater than the associated criterion level . in summary , automated measurements indicate that much of the time the acoustic impact of the wind turbine generators is not appreciably greater than the criteria utilized by the ontario ministry of the environment for wind turbine generators , and the sound levels track the anticipated background sound levels associated with the wind speed as predicted . however , under certain wind and atmospheric the sound level impact of the wind turbine generators is above the criterion of the moe . this was found to be most significant when winds were light ( between 5 and 7 m/s ) and from the south , and when high humidity was present . observations and measurements indicate that the wind turbine generators are continually audible at the d ’ entremont residence , to varying degrees . infrasound was not found to be an issue . modeling suggests that the impact of the wind turbine generators complies with the ontario ministry of environment criteria , notwithstanding periods when environmental effects increase the actual sound level above the numeric criteria .

appendix a : vestas v80 1.8 mw wind turbine generator data

v80-1.8 mw
versatile megawattage

this system features microprocessors that rotate the blades around their longitudinal axes , thus ensuring continuous adjustment to maintain optimal blade angles in relation to the prevailing wind . at the same time , optitip® makes it possible to keep sound levels within the limits stipulated by local regulations .

optimal output
another factor that helps to maximize the efficiency and optimize the sound level of the v80 is optislip® technology . the optislip® generator allows the turbine rotor speed to vary between 9 and 19 rpm , depending on conditions . while the technology involved may be advanced , its purpose is simple : to optimize output . it does this by tapping the higher efficiency of slow and variable rotation , storing excess energy in rotational form and exploiting the full force of transient gusts . all told , optislip® boosts annual energy production by around five per cent in relation to traditional fixed-speed turbines . as an added benefit , optislip® also reduces wear and tear on the gearbox , blades and tower on account of lower peak loading . moreover , as turbine sound is a function of wind speed , the lower rotation speeds made possible by optislip® naturally reduce sound levels . finally , optislip® helps the v80 deliver better quality power to the grid , with rapid synchronization , reduced harmonic distortion and less flicker . quite simply , the v80-1.8 mw turbine is synonymous with more output , better quality power and less mechanical strain and sound .

top of its class
the vestas v80 has been engineered to make the very most of aggressive sites , as it provides unparallelled productivity in both high and moderate winds . in terms of power output and swept area , it is the best turbine on the market in the 2 mw class . more than 1,000 of these turbines have already been installed around the world , and have proved themselves to be seasoned performers in both onshore and offshore environments . the high energy yield of the v80 makes it an excellent choice for locations where space is limited . however , it also boasts an excellent track record in challenging offshore conditions , where its high operational availability , excellent grid compliance and proven technology make it a competitive choice with respect to both cost and performance . one of the factors that contribute to the superior performance of the v80 is optitip® , its pitch regulation system .

proven performance
wind power plants require substantial investments , and the process can be very complex . to assist in the evaluation and purchasing process , vestas has identified four factors that are critical to wind turbine quality : energy production , operational availability , power quality and sound level . we spend months testing and documenting these performance areas for all vestas turbines . when we are finally satisfied , we ask an independent testing organisation to verify the results – a practice we call proven performance . at vestas we do not just talk about quality . we prove it .

the figure above illustrates the relationship between wind and sound levels , and that between wind and speeds of revolution for turbines equipped with optispeed® . it clearly shows the sound level advantages of lower speeds of revolution because the beneficial effect on sound levels of lower speeds of revolution is approximately 7 db ( a ) lower at 4 m/s than at 8 m/s . for other sound levels , the benefit can be as much as 10 db ( a ) . please note that a decrease of 3 db ( a ) is a halving of the sound level .

the sound output level can be adjusted by varying the revolution speed of the turbine as illustrated in the figure above . in practice , this means that , for example , the sound level recorded at a distance of 340 m ( hub height 78 m ) can be reduced from 44.5 to 40.4 db ( a ) – i.e . by more than half the recorded level .

optislip® allows the rotor speed to vary within a range of approximately 10 percent in relation to nominal rpm . this minimizes both unwanted fluctuations in the output to the grid supply and the loads on the vital parts of the construction .

versatile megawattage

in many fields of engineering , flexibility and efficiency are considered almost diametric opposites – i.e . one can only be improved at the expense of the other . at vestas , we specialize in finding ways to improve both at the same time . to see how we accomplish this , you need look no further than the v80 , the cornerstone of our 2 mw class . the v80 is a pitch-regulated turbine for medium and high winds that features optislip® variable-speed technology . optislip® allows the rotor speed to vary within a range of approximately 10 percent in relation to nominal rpm . optislip® thereby significantly increases productivity and makes it possible to keep sound levels within the limits stipulated by local regulations .

this flexibility , enhanced by a variety of tower heights , makes the v80 particularly well suited to a wide range of sites . together with optitip® , our pitch-regulation system , optislip® gives the v80 a competitive edge in its megawatt class . this edge , backed by vestas ’ reputation for dependability , superior project management and service , has made the v80 one of the best-selling turbines in the world . the popularity of the turbine means that we are able to keep production costs – and hence your cost per kwh – to a minimum . it is just one more way in which the versatility of the v80 leads to increased efficiency .

101 reasons why 1 why 1.2 and 1000ft will not protect public health & safety robert f kennedy- “ not all locations are suitable for an industrial-scale wind facility . ” this area has far too many homes to attempt the safe siting of an industrial wind farm . it is noticeably evident from the following data that the greater part of rural manitowoc county is not suitable for the siting of commercial wind energy development . the only way to mitigate incidents with noise , ice fling , flicker , blade throw , turbine collapse , and turbine fire is to implement adequate safety setbacks . safety standard advocated by the wind industry are ridiculously inadequate and benefit no one but themselves . “ i ’ m passionate about this because i firmly believe wind power is part of the solution and not a problem , as some people think , ” sagrillo says , “ but that solution has got to be acceptable to the neighborhood . you can ’ t just force things down people ’ throats . ” ( source-facing the wind.www.rednova.com/news ) different setbacks for inhabited structures have been proposed , depending on whether the inhabited structure belonged to a landowner who is leasing land to the wind project . again this distinction has no bearing on public health and safety , and should therefore not be allowed . in other words , if 1000 feet is necessary to protect one citizen , it is necessary for all citizens , whether or not they are receiving lease payments . ( source-8/27/04 state model wind ordinance ) if 1000 feet is necessary for safety , i have the right to be safe in my home and anywhere on my property . windrights windustry -turbines should be sited no less than five-times their rotor diameter from property lines , unless written permission is given by the neighbor . explanation : this recommendation is designed to protect wind rights of all landowners and minimize the impact of wind turbines on neighbors . wind turbines produce wake effects 8-11 rotor diameters downwind . requiring a setback of 5 rotor diameters from property lines provides a buffer that will protect the wind rights of all landowners in the vicinity of a wind project . we believe clear standards for property line setbacks are critical to preventing disputes over wind rights now and in the future . without standards , conflicts among neighbors and among wind developers can arise . ( source-wind energy easements and leases : best practices and policy recommendations ) . ontario , canada - in the absence of any specific local zoning or management issues , no turbine shall be positioned closer than five ( 5 ) rotor-diameters from the centre of the wind turbine to the lease property boundary in the dominant upwind or downwind direction , unless it can be demonstrated that site conditions , such as topography , natural features , or other conditions ( e.g . , offset of turbine locations ) warrant a lesser distance . in cases where the lessee holds a long-term lease on adjacent lands for wind energy development , this setback may be reduced to 1.5 times the total height of the wind turbine . no turbine shall be positioned closer than 1.5 times the total height of the wind turbine to the lease boundary in any other direction . ( source-ministry of natural resources , ontario , canada ) us dept of the interior , bureau of land management -no turbine shall be positioned closer than five ( 5 ) rotor-diameters from the center of the wind turbine to the right-of-way boundary in the dominant upwind or downwind direction , unless it can be demonstrated that site conditions , such as topography , natural features , or other conditions such as offsets of turbine locations warrant a lesser distance . in cases where the applicant holds a long-term lease right on adjacent federal or non-federal lands for wind energy development or the adjacent non-federal landowner provides a setback waiver , this setback requirement may be reduced to 1.5 times the total height of the wind turbine . further , no turbine shall be positioned closer than 1.5 times the total height of the wind turbine to the right-of-way boundary in any other direction . ( source-u . s. dept of the interior , bureau of land management , interim wind energy development policy ) california wind energy collaborative -scott larwood of the university of california-calculations reporting on a danish study-the distance the turbines should be from each other for minimal wind interference : three rotor diameters when aligned perpendicular to the wind and 10 rotor diameters when parallel to the wind . thus , the ge 1.4 mw turbine , with a 70.5 rotor span , requires 37-123 acres per tower , while each vestas 1.8 mw turbine , with a 90-m rotor , requires 60-200 acres per tower . ( source-permitting setbacks for wind turbines and the blade throw hazard , 2004 ca wind energy collaborative forum ) . blade failure , blade throw and icing this may not be something that happens every day , but these blades weigh several tons . if you were the landowner who owns the neighboring property when this happens , you wouldn ’ t care less how rare it was . while incidents may seem rare , this is partially due to the fact that the wind industry is not required to provide this information and therefore , fails to do so . and keep in mind , common sense tell us , the more turbines installed , the higher the possibility for safety and life threatening incidents . awea- in an article on the awea website , mick sagrillo of sagrillo power & light , who is also a wind enthusiast , summarized some of the insurance risk associated with wind turbines as follows : “ liability coverage needs to address two areas . the first is liability coverage for property damage . while claims in this area are extremely rare , the possibilities include such things as a blade flying off or a tower falling down , thereby causing damage to someone else ’ s property . the second concern centers around personal injury or death . again this could happen if a blade flew off the wind system or the tower fell down . however , it could also happen if someone fell from the tower , or someone was electrocuted while working on or nearby the system . ( www.awea.org ) california wind energy collaborative , scott larwood of the university of california-calculations reporting on a danish study establish how far a blade of fragment could be thrown at tip speeds at and above the normal operation maximum , expressed as multiples of the total turbine height , using data for 1.5-2.0 mw turbines . at the normal maximum , a blade could be thrown to a distance almost 1.5 times the turbine height and a hazardous fragment over 3.5 times the height . at twice the normal tip speed ; a complete blade could be thrown over 2.5 times the turbine height and a hazardous fragment almost 6.5 times the height . the maximum fragment distance is 6.5 times the turbine height . larwood also calculates blade and fragment thrown as a function of turbine height , finding that as height increases , the absolute distance they might be thrown increases , but as a multiple of turbine height , it decreases . example : a 164-ft turbine ( height to blade tip ) could throw a whole blade about 2.4 times the height , and a fragment over 5 times the height . a 328-ft turbine could throw a blade about 1.25 times the height and a fragment about 3.75 times the height . his research concludes that a reasonable expectation for blade failure is 1 per 100 turbines per year . “ i used to work in the industry and i ’ ve seen them fail . we talk about blade failure in our industry on a very limited basis . the first documented one was the turbine up in putnam new hampshire . they had a blade throw of 750ft .

this technology has limited impact on water resources in general . there is no running surface water at the project site . the turbine foundations are built at a depth of around 3.9 m , which is highly unlikely to affect any groundwater4 . in order to determine if there is a groundwater aquifer under the project site , drilling up to 30m deep took place at the location of wind turbine foundations . no aquifers were observed up to this depth , confirming that the project will not alter groundwater flow patterns5 . 2. air quality ( +2 )

by connecting to the grid , the project decreases turkey‟s dependence on thermal power sources , and indirectly reduces the emissions of fossil fuel pollutants ( i.e . sox , nox , and particulate matter ) 6 . 3. other pollutants ( 0 )

construction phase impacts on air quality are limited to those arising from the construction phase of the project . these are predominantly as a result of dust emissions produced by land excavation , transport , and discharge . the project developer will limit dust emissions by avoiding scattering , enclosing transportation vehicles and excavated material with plastic protection sheeting , keeping the roads wet , and operating vehicles at low speeds7 . operation the only potentially toxic or hazardous materials from wind turbines are relatively small amounts of lubricants , hydraulic , and insulating fluids . contamination of surface or ground water , or soils is highly unlikely given that these state-of–the-art wind turbines are equipped with oil absorption systems specifically to prevent such leaks . in the

event of uncontrolled leakage , oil and grease are collected in the bottom part of the nacelle enclosure . each wind turbine is equipped with a series of smaller oil collection systems for individual wind turbine components8 . noise from wind turbines is both aerodynamic and mechanical . vibration damping and noise reduction from the gearbox and the generator are effected through elastometer elements9 . this greatly reduces mechanical noise , and limits noise from the 2.5xl wind turbine to aerodynamic noise generated by blade rotation . irrespective of wind speed and hub height , the ge 2.5xl wind turbine is not expected to have an audible tonality at a distance of more than 300 m10 . the calculation of the projected noise levels from the wind turbines given the site conditions , highlight that at a distance of 1,000m from the wind farm , noise levels will be around 40dba11 . the nearest residential community to the wind farm gokmustafa , which , at 1,000 m distance from the site , will therefore not be affected by noise from the wind farm . it is important to note that with higher wind speeds , ambient wind noise will most likely mask any noise generated by the wind turbines12 . 4. soil condition ( 0 )

the project site is in a mountainous area owned by the ministry of environment and forestry and is defined in three sections : savranli ( the western portion ) , gokcedag ( the central portion ) , and aslanlibel ( the eastern portion ) . savranrli is mainly an open area with some scattered trees ; however there are several parts that are wooded on both sides of the ridge . gokcedag is predominantly an open area , but covered by trees 2–4 m in height . aslanlibel‟s ridges are also covered by similar height trees . the dominant tree species is pinus brutia , commonly referred to as „turkish pine‟ . the project will clear young trees to open new roads and improve existing roads‟ condition , and install the wind turbines . the project developer received a permit from the ministry of environment and forestry to use the land for construction and operation of the wind farm13 . the project developer also paid a fee for tree cutting that will be used by the ministry of forestry for reforestation projects . following the suggestions of local authorities including osmaniye forestry department , the project developer will implement a forestation project on land provided by the department of forestry . the project developer is in the midst of negotiations with the osmaniye department of forestry regarding the location , the species to be planted , and the planting schedule ( which depends on the particular species ) . the monitoring plan can only therefore be updated once these specifics are defined and finalised . 5. biodiversity ( 0 )

given its proximity to a human settlement ( 1 km ) , the project site has likely witnessed anthropogenic interventions that adversely affected vegetation coverage in some areas . an indicator to such disturbance is the existence of dirt roads .

section b. application of a baseline methodology

b.1 .

title and reference of the approved baseline methodology applied to the project activity :

the united nations approved consolidated baseline methodology applicable to this project is acm0002 “ consolidated methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources ” , version 725. acm0002 refers to the following tools :   b.1.1 . “ tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality ” , version 05 , adopted at eb 3926 , and „„tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system‟‟ , version 01 , annex 12 , eb 3527. justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the project activity :

acm0002 is applicable to this project activity because it fulfils the required criteria :    the project consists of a wind power electricity capacity addition and is a grid-connected electricity generation project ; the project does not involve switching from fossil fuel use to renewable energy at the site of the project activity ; and the geographic and system boundaries for the relevant electricity grid can be clearly identified , and information on the characteristics of the grid is available .

b.2 .

description of how the methodology is applied in the context of the project activity :

this project follows the methodology described in the acm0002 “ consolidated baseline methodology for gridconnected electricity generation from renewable sources ” , version 07. the expected net electricity generation ( egnet , y ) is 466,742 mwh/year the grid emission factor ( efgrid , cm , y ) is calculated according to the „„tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system‟‟28 . as per the tool , the following six steps for calculation of emission reductions have been applied : step 1. identification of the relevant electrical power system

according to the „„tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system‟‟ , version 01 , a project electricity system has to be defined by the spatial extent of the power plants that are physically connected through transmission and distribution lines to the project activity , and that can be dispatched without significant transmission constraints . therefore , in this project activity the project electricity system includes the project site and all power plants attached to the interconnected turkish national grid . for imports from connected electricity systems located in another host country ( ies ) , the emission factor is 0 tco2/mwh .

step 2 .

selection of an operating margin ( om ) method

according to the „„tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system‟‟ , in calculating the operating margin grid emission factor in a given year y ( efgrid , om , y ) , project developers have the option of selecting from four potential methods : ( a ) simple om , or ( b ) simple adjusted om , or ( c ) dispatch data analysis om , or ( d ) average om . options ( b ) and ( c ) are not selected due to the limited availability of data for turkey . option ( d ) is not selected since low-cost / must run resources29 do not constitute more than 50 % of total grid generation . option ( a ) is therefore selected since low-cost / must run resources constitute less than 50 % of total grid generation ( see table 3 ) . furthermore , there is no indication that coal is used as must-run , and no nuclear energy plants are located in turkey . table 3. breakdown by source of the electricity generation for the five most recent years of the turkish grid30
2006 total generation low-cost / must run generation low-cost / must run generation proportion [ gwh ] [ gwh ] [ % ] 176,300 44,465 25 2005 161,956 39,714 25 2004 150,698 46,235 31 2003 140,581 35,480 25 2002 129,400 34,978 27 average 151,787 40,174 26

since the simple om calculation ( option a ) is selected , the emission factor is calculated by the generation-weighted average emissions per electricity unit ( tco2/gwh ) , and averaged over the past three years of all generating sources serving the system , not including low-cost / must run power plants . the tool gives two options for the calculation of efgrid , om , y ;  ex-ante option a 3-year generation-weighted average , based on the most recent data available at the time of submission of the ver-pdd to the doe for validation , without the requirement to monitor and recalculate the emissions factor during the crediting period , or ex-post option the year in which the project activity displaces grid electricity , with the requirement that the emissions factor to be updated annually during monitoring .



for this project the ex-ante approach is selected . data for calculating the three year average is obtained from the period 2004 – 2006 , the most recent data available at the time of pdd submission to the doe .

step 3 .

calculating the operating margin emission factor according to the selected method .

the simple om emission factor is calculated as the generation-weighted average co2 emissions per unit net electricity generation ( tco2/mwh ) of all generating power plants serving the system , not including low-cost / must run plants / units . it may be calculated :    based on fuel consumption and net electricity generation data of each power plant / unit ( option a ) , or based on net electricity generation data , the average efficiency of each power unit , and the fuel type ( s ) used in each power unit ( option b ) , or based on total net electricity generation data of all power plants serving the system , fuel types , and total fuel consumption of the project electricity system ( option c )

as fuel consumption and average efficiency data for each power plant / unit are not available , option c is used for simple om calculation . under option c , the simple om emission factor is calculated based on the net electricity supplied to the grid by all power plants serving the system , not including low-cost / must run power plants / units , and based on fuel type ( s ) , and total fuel consumption of the project electricity system , as follows :

identifying the cohort of the power units to be included in the build margin .

the sample group of power units ( m ) used to calculate the build margin consists of whichever is larger of : a ) the set of five power units that have been built most recently , and b ) the set of power capacity additions in the electricity system that comprise 20 % of the system generation ( in mwh ) and that have been built most recently38 .

option ( b ) has been chosen to identify this cohort of power units to be included in the build margin , since it is larger ( in terms of power generation ) than the result of ( a ) . the list of the power plants is defined in annex 2 ( baseline information ) of this pdd . step 5. calculation of the build margin emission factor .

the build margin emission factor is the generation-weighted average emission factor ( in tco2/mwh ) of all power units ( m ) during the most recent year y for which power generation data is available , and is calculated as follows :

efgrid , bm , y
where : efgrid , bm , y egm , y efel , m , y

as per the „„tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system‟‟ , the co2 emission factor of each power unit m ( efel , m , y ) should be determined as per the guidance from the tool in „step 3‟ for simple om , using options b1 , b2 , or b3 , and using for y the most recent historical year for which power generation data is available , where m is the power units included in the build margin . as plant specific fuel consumption data is not available for turkey , option b2 has been selected for the calculation of the co2 emission factor of each power unit m ( efel , m , y ) as follows :

the efgrid , bm , which is calculated via equation ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) using data from tables 10 and 11 , is 617 tco2e/gwh . step 6. calculation of the combined margin emission factor

the combined margin emission factor is calculated as follows :

efgrid , cm , y  efgrid , om , y * wom  efgrid , bm , y * wbm
where : efgrid , cm , y efgrid , om , y efgrid , bm , y wom wbm combined margin emission factor in year y ( tco2/gwh ) operating margin emission factor in year y ( tco2/gwh ) build margin emission factor in year y ( tco2/gwh ) weight of the operating margin emission factor weight of the build margin emission factor

( 4 )

as the proposed project is a wind farm , the weights for the operating margin and build margin emission factors are 0.75 and 0.25 respectively , by default . therefore , as per equation ( 4 ) , the combined margin emission factor is : efgrid , cm , y = 648 tco2e/gwh . project emissions the proposed project activity involves the generation of electricity by development of a wind farm . the generation of electricity does not result in greenhouse gas emissions and therefore : pey = 0 tco2/year

the resultant alternatives to the project as outlined in step ( 1a ) are all in compliance with all these applicable laws . outcome of step 1b mandatory legislation and regulations for each alternative are taken into account in sub-step 1b . based on the above analysis , the proposed project activity is not the only alternative amongst the project participants that is in compliance with mandatory regulations . therefore , the proposed ver project activity may be additional . step 2. investment analysis

the purpose of investment analysis is to determine whether the proposed project activity is economically or financially less attractive without carbon revenues than the remaining alternatives . to conduct the investment analysis , the following sub-steps are adhered to : sub-step 2a . determine appropriate analysis method

the „tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality ’ , version 05 , from eb39 , lists three possible analysis methods :    option i : option ii : option iii : simple cost analysis ; investment comparison analysis ; and benchmark analysis .

since the proposed project generates financial and economic benefits through the sales of electricity other than carbon revenues , option i can not be used . option ii is only applicable to projects where alternatives should be similar investment projects in terms of generation capacity . between option ii and option iii , benchmark financial analysis ( option iii ) is chosen . sub-step 2b . option iii . apply benchmark analysis

according to the “ tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality ” , version 05 , from eb39 , a relevant benchmark for a project‟s irr can be derived from government bond rates that have been increased by a suitable risk premium ( to reflect private investment and/or project type ) .   according to bloomberg44 , an acknowledged independent source of financial data and investment information , the government bond in turkey ( also known as the “ risk free rate ” ) is 15.92 % . risk premiums generally reflect circumstances related both to the individual country where the investment is taking place and to the technology in question . o as per bloomberg , the country risk for turkey is currently 0.71 % . o a reliable risk premium related to wind power projects ( i.e . technology risk ) could not be identified due to a lack of public information in this sector . however , it is well known that energy sector projects face overall levels of risk that may be higher than other sectors of the economy , and specifically wind power plants face significant levels of performance risk , related to climatic factors , as well as risks associated with the fact that this is a much newer technology than conventional thermal power generation projects . this suggests that a realistic risk premium for this type of

project would be higher than the 0.71 % premium indicated by the country risk , suggesting that this approach is conservative . therefore , a realistic benchmark irr for this type of project should be greater than the base investment threshold ( turkey government bonds ) plus a risk premium , which given the actual figures referenced , is 16.63 % ( 15.92 % + 0.71 % ) . sub-step 2c . calculation and comparison of financial indicators

1. parameters needed for calculation of key financial indicators on 18/05/2005 , the “ law on utilization of renewable energy resources for the purpose of generating electricity energy ” 45 was enacted . article 6 of this law guarantees the purchase of electricity generated from renewable resources , at a 7-year fixed price based on turkish currency , i.e . the average wholesale price as determined by the electricity market regulatory authority . with the enactment of the “ law on energy efficiency ” 46 on 02/05/2007 , the purchase guarantee for electricity from renewable energy plants was extended from 7 to 10 years , at a price of €.05/kwh . this new law can be considered as a step forward for the promotion of renewable energy , since it reduces the financial risks that these types of project face . however , this guaranteed price is insufficient to make wind energy projects financially viable . according to the financial feasibility study of the proposed project , the parameters required for the calculation of key financial indicators are in table 12. the study47 was performed by zorlu enerji‟s finance department ( part of zorlu grubu ) on 17/06/2008 . the latter is ranked among the largest corporate groups in turkey , given its total asset volume of approximately us $ 8 billion , and number of employees ( around 22,000 ) . zorlu grubu is one of turkey‟s leading multi-sectoral conglomerates , with 64 subsidiaries , active in the areas of textiles , electronics , energy , „white goods‟ , and financial services , covering turkey , the usa , hong kong , south africa , and russia . table 12. basic parameters for financial analysis

2. comparison of irr for the proposed project and the financial benchmark in accordance with benchmark analysis ( option iii ) , if the financial indicators of the proposed project , such as the project irr54 , are lower than the benchmark , the proposed project is not considered financially attractive . table 13 includes the project irr with and without carbon revenues . without the additional income to the project developer resulting from ver sales , the equity irr is 10.73 % , which is lower than the financial benchmark . thus , the proposed project is not financially attractive . taking ver revenues into consideration , the equity irr increases to 14.24 % , but remains lower than the financial benchmark . however , ver revenues provide an additional source of income to the project , in addition to intangible benefits to the country , such as : diversification of energy sources in turkey ; transfer of new technology and knowledge from technology provider general electric to the turkish project developer ; and decrease in turkey‟s dependence on foreign energy sources with a simultaneous strengthening of the country‟s energy security and self sufficiency .

sensitivity analysis

as per annex 35 “ guidance on the assessment of investment analysis ” 55 , from eb 39 , only variables ( including initial investment cost ) that constitute more than 20 % of either total project costs or total project revenues should be subjected to reasonable variation . for the proposed project , four parameters have been identified based on figure 4 : 1 ) 2 ) 3 ) 4 ) wind turbine cost expected tariff annual electricity generation interest rate

for benchmark analysis , the irr shall be calculated as equity irr , according to the “ tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality ” , version 05 , from eb39

although the impact of annual electricity generation on irr is the same as the impact resulting from electricity tariff deviation , the impact of annual electricity generation is considered in the sensitivity analysis since the likelihood of change for each parameter varies . the results of the sensitivity analysis are in table 14. table 14. irr results of sensitivity analysis
% change to reach 16.63 % irr benchmark -18.8 % +14.0 % +14.0 % -38.2 %

scenario wind turbine cost electricity tariff annual electricity generation interest rate

these variations do not reflect a realistic range of assumptions for the input parameters of the financial analysis as detailed : wind turbine cost : a 18.8 % decrease in wind turbines costs is highly unlikely given that worldwide wind turbines cost has been on the increase recently due to higher commodity prices ( e.g . steel and oil ) 56 , increasing demand , shortages in certain turbine components , up-scaling of turbine size ( and hub height ) , and improved sophistication of turbine design ( e.g . improved grid interactions ) 57. ge is unable to keep up with a growing demand for wind turbines58 . electricity tariff : the energy efficiency law defines a range of €.050 - .055/kwh for the purchase of electricity from renewable energy sources for 10 years , for plants put in operation prior to 2012. this shows that the maximum possible increase in tariff is 10 % ( [ ( .055 - .050 ) /.050 ] x 100 % = 10 % increase ) . the

renewable energy law encourages free competition between power plants in order to lower the cost of power production and thereby electricity tariffs . however , since a majority of power plants in turkey are still state-owned , turkey can control supply and hence influence prices . overall , competition for “ must run ” wind farms is difficult because they can not control their output in response to market demand , contrary to conventional power plants ( which can adapt generation to actual demand ) . in view of these arguments , proposed project electricity tariffs can not increase by 14 % , and as such the 16.63 % benchmark is unlikely to be reached this way . annual electricity generation : the annual electricity generation used to calculate the equity irr is based on the mircositing study of the project ( 466,742 mwh ) . in this study , under the worst and best case scenarios , the electricity generation will not fluctuate above or below 10 % the adopted generation levels as summarized in table 15. therefore , a 14 % increase in annually generated el4ectricity is highly unlikely . projected net annual electricity production ( aep ) 59

interest rate :

chances of a decrease in interest rates by 38.2 % in turkey are very unlikely . in june 2008 , the monetary policy committee of the central bank of turkey decided to increase borrowing rates . further increases are expected when the central bank considers them necessary in light of developments in global markets , external demand and fiscal policy implementation in turkey60 . furthermore , the european central bank raised its benchmark interest rate in june 2007 by a quarter point . this is considered the ninth increase since december 200561. these results illustrate that only with highly improbable unrealistic circumstances would it be possible to reach the equity irr benchmark . it is therefore fair and conservative to conclude that the equity irr was lower than the benchmark for a realistic range of assumptions for the sensitivity analysis input parameters , and that the project was not financially attractive without carbon revenues . this demonstrates that the project activity would not have been implemented without the ver revenues . outcome of step 2 : sensitivity analysis shows that ver revenues will improve the project‟s financial indicators . however , the project‟s equity irr is unable to reach the benchmark , supporting the conclusion that the proposed project is unlikely to be financially attractive . step 3. barrier analysis

this step is used to determine whether the proposed project activity faces barriers that :

a ) prevent the implementation of this type of proposed project activity ; and b ) do not prevent the implementation of at least one of the alternatives . the following sub-steps are followed : sub-step 3a . identify barriers that would prevent the implementation of type of the proposed project activity

establish that there are barriers that would prevent the implementation of the type of proposed project activity from being carried out , if the project activity was not registered as a ver activity . these barriers include : investment barriers the lack of financial incentives is the primary barrier for renewable energy investments in turkey . the carbon market provides an innovative enabling environment for renewable electricity generation sources . the following barriers apply to wind power projects in turkey :  high level of financing and long payback period in general , wind farm investment costs are about 40 % higher than those of a comparable coal-fired power plant , in terms of cost per unit of installed capacity ( $ /mwh ) . furthermore , the utilization hours of wind farms are about one third of those of a coal-fired power plant62 . therefore , the high initial investment cost leads to a long payback period and a higher investment risk on project financing . low project irr the internal rate of return ( irr ) of the project without ver revenue was too low to secure project financing as summarized in table 13 ( above ) . country risk despite the evident macroeconomic progress that turkey has been experiencing , the country‟s inflation rate and financial markets remain unstable , rendering turkey less attractive for longer term investments such as wind power63 . in 2007 , the turkish inflation rate exceeded expectations for that year ( figure 5 ) , and was high compared to other countries ( figure 6 ) .

grid usage fee teias‟ fee for usage of the public grid is defined by the installed capacity and not the actual output of the power plant68 . such a fee is less of a burden to conventional power plants , which use 7085 % of their installed capacity to generate electricity , compared to wind power plants , which use only about 30 % of their capacity69 . such a system favors conventional power plants . this barrier clearly discourages investment in wind farms ( alternative 1 ) compared to alternative 2 ( thermal power plant ) . high value added tax since the wind turbines are imported from germany and spain70 , their spare parts , when needed , will have to be imported as well . rotor elektrik has been exempted from paying vat for the wind turbines but not for their spare parts . they are subject to 18 % value added tax , „vat‟ .

o

technological barriers the minimal share of installed wind power capacity in turkey ( lower than 0.2 % 71 ) reflects the technological risks associated to this power source . the hardware is often imported and highly advanced , with no local spare parts supply . larger operation and maintenance reserves would need to be maintained for such eventualities , as would apply to the ge 2.5xl wind turbine to be used in the project . furthermore , ge‟s 2.5xl wind turbines are the largest onshore ge model with a rotor diameter of 100 meters ( an increase of 12 meters over the previous model 2.5mw wind turbine ) . in order to overcome the technology risks , ge provided training courses ( in germany ) on the operation and maintenance of the wtg2.5xl turbines , as well as in the use of personal protective equipment , for 6 of zorlu‟s osmaniye wind farm personnel during september 2008. barriers due to prevailing practice the majority of wind farms in turkey are characterised by small installed capacity , and are developed as build operate transfer ( bot ) projects ( or as ver projects ) ( see table 15 ) . rotor elektrik„s 135 mw wind power project involves higher risks , as it is the world 's largest installation of general electric ( ge ) energy 's latest 2.5xl wind turbines , and will more than double the country 's installed wind capacity72 . according to the european wind energy association , turkey had 84 mw of installed wind capacity at the beginning of 2007 , accounting for an increase of only 65 mw compared to the start of 200673. sub-step 3 b. show that the identified barriers would not prevent the implementation of at least one of the alternatives ( except the proposed project activity )

the aforementioned barriers are largely specific to wind power projects . they have minimal impact on the alternatives that are included in the baseline scenario of acm0002 , namely electricity generation by existing gridconnected power plants .

according to table 17 , the majority of the projects already operating are either : - significantly smaller than the osmaniye rotor elektrik project ; - built operate transfer ( bot ) projects , hence facing less technological and investment barriers than the proposed project ; or - operating under voluntary carbon emission reduction standards ( such as the gold standard ) . no wind farms of a comparable size to the project activity have been built in turkey , and no windfarm larger than 10mw has been built in the absence of carbon finance . therefore the project activity is the first of its kind , and would not be viable without carbon credit financing . sub-step 4b . discuss any similar options that are occurring

as detailed in table 16 , the wind farms connected to the national grid differ from the proposed project in installed capacity and operation practices ( i.e . operating as bot plants and not privately owned ) . the remaining projects that are comparable to the project activity in terms of installed capacity are being developed as ver projects . thus , no similar options remain , indicating that wind farms of similar output to the proposed project at osmaniye are far from being common practice in turkey unless they are voluntary carbon offset projects . it is therefore fair and conservative to conclude that the project is the first of its kind in turkey , is not common practice , and can therefore be considered additional .

section d. application of a monitoring methodology and plan

d.1 .

name and reference of approved monitoring methodology applied to the project activity :

the project applied the approved consolidated baseline methodology acm0002 “ consolidated methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources ” , version 7 d.2 . justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the project activity :

the monitoring methodology acm0002 is applicable to this project activity because it fulfils the required criteria :  the project consists of a wind power electricity capacity addition and is a grid-connected electricity generation project ;  the project does not involve switching from fossil fuel use to renewable energy at the site of the project activity ; and  the geographic and system boundaries for the relevant electricity grid can be clearly identified and information on the characteristics of the grid is available . d.2 . 1. option 1 : monitoring of the emissions in the project scenario and the baseline scenario as the necessary baseline emission factors are all defined ex-ante ( operating and build margin , see baseline description ) , the only information to be monitored is the amount of electricity fed into the grid by rotor elektrik osmaniye wind farm . the data collected will be kept by rotor elektrik during the crediting period , and for two years after the last issuance of vers for the rotor elektrik osmaniye wind farm project activity for that crediting period . as the emission factors are calculated ex ante for the period of 7 years , the combined margin will be recalculated at any renewal of the crediting period using the valid baseline methodology acm0002 .

the sustainability matrix , ms. kilic guided the audience through the environmental and socioeconomic questionnaire and opened the floor for questions and answers . attendants were invited to express their comments about the project through a q & a session , and by filling the environmental and socioeconomic impacts questionnaire . following the event , on june 25th and 26th , il tekno circulated the socio-economic questionnaire and project summary to the meeting absentees ( from the list of 54 invitees ) , and gave them until july 8th to return the completed questionnaire , and raise comments about the project . four questionnaires were returned , from : osmaniye governorate , the association in support of contemporary living ( çagdas yasami destekleme dernegi ) , the general directorate of electrical power survey and development administration ( eiei ) , and tema foundation102 . the four questionnaires received from the absentees highlighted positive comments regarding the project , such as : - there is minimal noise expected from the ge 2.5xl turbines , and there is no expected project impact on water resources ( eiei ) ; - the project site is not a habitat of important species , and zorlu has enough capacity to manage occupational risks ( tema foundation ) ; - no harmful impact of the project on the surrounding environment ( governorate of osmaniye ) . main stakeholder consultation : the main stakeholder consultation process took place from august 20th to october 18th 2008 , and was organized by rotor elektrik uretim a.s. , ecosecurities group plc , and il tekno a.s. it consisted of : circulating the project documentation103 to the list of 54 stakeholders who were invited to the initial stakeholder consultation . the documents were sent out between august 20 and 28 , 2008 , and the stakeholders were given until october 17 to respond with comments . publishing the pdd on tuv-rheinland website for international stakeholder comments . the international stakeholder consultation was closed on october 17 , 2008 .

-

during the main stakeholder consultation , only one comment was received from the turkish stakeholders from osmaniye special provincial administration highlighting the following : hiring locals for the security jobs would result in the local people being more sensitive to protect the project site it would be an advantage for dhmi to carry the radar station to a place where the road maintenance costs would be lower ( where there is no road problem ) . dhmi ( general directorate of state airports authority of turkey ) goes for a tender regarding road maintanance every year . if you can send the translation of the pdd , we can also submit our comments about it

zorlu responded in turkish to the comments ( see annex a ) : - priority is given to local people for employment based on the specialty and duties of the job . we are happy to inform you that we got the support of gökmustafa , savranli and kizlaç villages which are adjacent to the project site . relocating of the radar station is on the agenda of the relevant administration . a tender will be conducted by dhmi for the radar stations including the one on the project site . dhmi is the authorized entity to decide on the new location and relocation of the radar station according to the needs and specifications of the subject . - the turkish version of the pdd will be sent by ecosecurities . given that the project design document is an extensive technical document , and considering that the project summary104 in turkish covers the main points in the pdd , ecosecurities deemed the translation of the pdd to turkish unnecessary , and sent a response in turkish ( see annex b ) to the osmaniye special provincial administration translating as follows : we are writing in response to your letter dated 14 august 2008 , in which you requested a turkish translation of the project design document ( pdd ) of osmaniye wind farm project . kindly note that the project summary in turkish that we have sent you covers in detail the content of the pdd , which is an extensive technical document of more than 60 pages . the content of the turkish summary will give you enough information to decide whether you have additional clarifications to request . ecosecurities will be happy to reply to specific questions related to the project summary and hence the pdd . aside from this comment , no feedback was received from other stakeholders and from the international stakeholder consultation , hence closing the overall stakeholder consultation process . g.2 . summary of the comments received :

the comments received on the project were during the initial stakeholder consultation meeting . the attendees expressed their opinion and raised questions to rotor elektrik uretim representatives , who answered the comments during the meeting . the comments raised and responses received are summarised in table 20. table 20. comments and responses received during the stakeholder consultation meeting
response most of the wind turbines are located in bahçe ; nearly 20 of them are located in hasanbeyli . this technology has minimal impact on water resources in general . the foundation of the turbines and electricity cables connecting the turbines are at 3.9 m and 1m depth respectively , and will not impact groundwater .

comment how many of the wind turbines are located in bahçe and in hasanbeyli ? will excavation works during construction affect the water resources ( groundwater and surface water spring ) near the wind farm ?

the project summary will be made available to the doe upon request . it covered the following topics : introduction to the pdd , project description , carbon emission reduction estimates , additionality , sustainability matrix , summary of the initial stakeholder consultation , monitoring plan , and contact information .

will zorlu hire people from the local towns ? we appreciate your investment in osmaniye , and we expect you to create employment for us . how will you maintain security in the project site ? what are the benefits of this project for turkey in general ? will zorlu build a road in hasanbeyli ? we request you to limit cutting trees in the area where the wind farm will be located .

this technology does not require much labour , but zorlu will do its best to hire local people when possible . in the construction phase we will have watchmen , but permanent security is still being negotiated within zorlu . the project will produce approximately 500,000 mwh electricity per year , using an environmentally friendly technology which will contribute to the prevention of the energy deficit in turkey . we will strive to achieve the best of our ability under social responsibilities . we agree to this point . however , we can not avoid a certain level of tree cutting . the project has been approved by the ministry of forestry and environment , and we have paid the ministry a fee for tree cutting as a way of compensating for the tree cutting necessitated by the project . this technology does not emit radiation it will be minimal since the closest town is 1 km away from the site . we are communicating with the general directorate of state airports authority of turkey ( dhmi ) to displace the radar station , and expect to receive an approval on this matter soon . in the meantime , we will avoid locating wind turbines in the vicinity of the station .

is there a radiation threat from the project ? what will be the impact from noise to the surrounding ? how will the project deal with the radar station close to the site ?

g.3 .

report on how due account was taken of any comments received :

based on the comments received by the stakeholders , rotor elektrik uretim will : give local employment priority for assistant operation positions . the expected positions that will be occupied by locals are around 25 full time positions in site security and switchboard operation and management . continue its communications with the general directorate of state airports authority of turkey ( dhmi ) to change the current location of the radar station

-

other comments have already been taken into account as part of the project design , such as the management of earthquake risks in the design of the wind turbines , mitigation of dust emissions during construction , and assessment of the project‟s visual impact on the surrounding landscape . following the project validation , and as part of its corporate social responsibility efforts , the project developer is planning to implement a number of micro projects in the osmaniye province . the project developer subcontracted a turkish consultancy firm to run a socio economic and needs assessment survey in the villages of bahce , gokmustafa , hasanbeyli , and savranli . the results of the survey will be shared at an open meeting with local stakeholders who will be involved in the selection of the micro projects .

introduction :
the demand for energy has increased in tremendous proportions in the last few decades in pakistan ; the same is expected to increase further in the coming years . the primary sources of energy available in pakistan are oil , natural gas , hydro and nuclear power . at present oil accounts for approximately 45 % of total commercial energy supply . the share of natural gas is 34 % while that of hydel power remains roughly at 15 % . the increase in cost of fossil fuel and the various environmental problems of large scale power generation have lead to increased appreciation of the potential of electricity generation from non-conventional sources . this has provided the planners and economists to find out other low cost energy resources . wind and solar energies are the possible clean and low cost renewable resources available in the country . the potential , for the use of alternative technologies , has never been fully explored in pakistan . wind power provides opportunity to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuel and at the same time expands the power supply capacity to remote locations where grid expansion is not practical . recently conducted survey of wind power potential along coastal areas of the country by pakistan meteorological department ( pmd ) , indicates that a potential exists for harvesting wind energy using currently available technologies , especially along sindh coast . gharo , one of the sites in sindh where the wind data have been recorded and studied by pmd , has been selected for this feasibility study . the wind measurements at gharo have been carried out during 24 months period . the annual mean wind speed is estimated to be 6.86m/s at 50 meter above ground level . the annual power density of area is 408.6 w/m2 , which bring the site into good category of power potential , which means this area is suitable for large economically viable wind farm . using the measured wind data the annual gross energy production by an 18 mw wind farm consisting of thirty – 600 kw turbines will be 45 million kwh . taking into account the wind turbine availability , net losses and wake effects in the wind farm the net annual energy production is estimated to 31 million kwh per year corresponding to a capacity factor of 28 % . the total investment will be rs : 850 million and pay back period will be 7-8 years . the capital cost of wind power projects ranges rs 4 to5 crore per mw . this gives a levelised cost of wind energy generation in the range of rs : 2.50 to 3.00 per kwh , taking into consideration the fiscal benefits extended by the government .

wind power production
there are two terms to describe basic electricity production . 1. efficiency , 2. capacity factor . efficiency refers to how much useful energy ( electricity , in this case ) we can get from an energy source . a 100 percent energy efficient machine would change all the energy put into it into useful energy . it would not waste any energy . there is no such thing as a 100 percent energy efficient machine . some energy is always lost or wasted when one form of energy is converted to another . the lost energy is usually in the form of heat , which dissipates into the air and can not be used again economically . how efficient are wind machines ? wind machines are just as efficient as most other plants , such as coal plants . wind machines convert 30-40 percent of the wind ’ s kinetic energy into electricity . a coal-fired power plant converts about 30-35 percent of the chemical energy in coal into usable electricity . capacity refers to the capability of a power plant to produce electricity . a power plant with a 100 percent capacity rating would run all day , every day at full power . there would be no down time for repairs or refueling , an impossible goal for any plant . coal plants typically have a 75 percent capacity rating since they can run day or night , during any season of the year . wind power plants are different from power plants that burn fuel . wind plants depend on the availability of wind , as well as the speed of the wind . therefore , wind machines can not operate 24 hours a day , 365 days a year . a wind turbine at a typical wind farm operates 65-80 percent of the time , but usually at less than full capacity , because the wind speed is not at optimum levels . therefore , its capacity factor is 30-35 percent . economics also plays a large part in the capacity of wind machines . winds machines can be built that have much higher capacity factors , but it is not economical to do so . the decision is based on electricity output per dollar of investment . capacity factor the annual energy output from a wind turbine is to look at the capacity factor for the turbine in its particular location . by capacity factor we mean its actual annual energy output divided by the theoretical maximum output , if the machine were running at its rated ( maximum ) power during all of the 8766 hours of the year . example : if a 600 kw turbine produces 1.5 million kwh in a year , its capacity factor is = 1500000 : ( 365.25 * 24 * 600 ) = 1500000 : 5259600 = 0.285 = 28.5 per cent . capacity factors may theoretically vary from 0 to 100 per cent , but in practice they will usually range from 20 to 70 per cent , and mostly be around 25-30 per cent .

energy production
wind generated electric power out put at gharo has been estimated by using the 600kw wind turbine bonus 600/40 mk iv type . the cut-in wind speed of turbine is 3m/s and cutout wind speed is 25m/s . rotor diameter is 44 meters and hub height has been taken as 50 meter . the monthly and annual wind generated electric power out put at gharo-sindh along with capacity factor are given in table-1a , b and the month-wise hourly wind power output is given in the appendix . the minor differences between the output electric energy shown in table-1a & b and in appendix are due to calculations on monthly and hourly basis respectively .

*note : towers are manufactured as a lattice tower or a tubular tower . towers
are always manufactured in at least two pieces for assembling at the site . the heaviest part is not weighing more than 20 tons . using the measurement of wind data the annual energy production by an 18mw farm consisting of thirty-600kw turbine will be about 45 million kwh . taking into account the wind turbine availability , net loses and wake effect in the wind farm , the net annual energy production is estimated 31 million kwh per year , corresponding to a capacity factor of 28 % . it is important to note that the wind does not blow all the time . since typical storage is not possible other fuel sources are used when the wind is not blowing .

proposed map of 18mw wind farm area
a typical wind farm of 30 turbines might extend over an area of 1 square kilometer but only 1 % of the land area would be taken in use , the remainder can be used for purposes such as farming . in this study one square kilometer area is used and 30 wind turbines are proposed to install in the area as shown in the map-1 .

performance
generally wind farm located in area with good winds and having a typical value of capacity factor i.e . 25 % at least are economically viable . a typical life of wind turbine is 20 to 25 years . maintenance is required at 6 months interval . the total investment for the proposed project is rs : 850 million and pay back period 7-8 years . the capital cost of a typical wind power project ranges rs 4 to5 crore per mw . this gives a levelised cost of wind energy generation in the range of rs : 2.5 to 3.00 per kwh , taking into consideration the fiscal benefits extended by the government . different economic aspects of the project are shown in table 4 , 5 & 6 .

i. the returns from investments in this sector are very dependent on government policies , both in terms of the incentives given and the taxation structure imposed on businesses . hence changes in either are a source of concern to the investors . for example , changes in the tax laws that make all companies liable to pay a minimum tax on their profits , may negatively affect the wind program because it reduces the benefit from the tax shelter that investments here could provide . ii . the main “ fuel ” controlling generation in any year is the wind speed . this is beyond the investor ’ s control : there is always the risk that actual generation in any year could be below the expected level . iii . grid availability to evacuate the generated power is an essential requirement . poor grid availability and reliability are again risks that have to be borne by the investors under the current situation .

critical determinants of financial returns
i. ii . iii . iv . the capacity factor of the wind turbine or wind potential of an area , the purchase price for the power generated , the term structure of the loan taken for the project , the rate of interest of the loan .

the benefits of wind energy
wind energy is an ideal renewable energy because : 1 . 2 . 3 . 4. it is a pollution-free , infinitely sustainable form of energy it doesn ’ t require fuel it doesn ’ t create greenhouse gasses it doesn ’ t produce toxic or radioactive waste .

• wind energy is quiet and does not present any significant hazard to birds or other wildlife . • when large arrays of wind turbines are installed on farmland , only about 2 % of the land area is required for the wind turbines . the rest is available for farming , livestock , and other uses . • landowners often receive payment for the use of their land , which enhances their income and increases the value of the land . • ownership of wind turbine generators by individuals and the community allows people to participate directly in the preservation of our environment . • each megawatt-hour of electricity that is generated by wind energy helps to reduce 0.8 to 0.9 tones of greenhouse gas emissions that are produced by coal or diesel fuel generation each year .

annual report on u.s. wind power installation , cost , and performance trends : 2007

introduction
the u.s. wind industry experienced unprecedented growth in 2007 , surpassing even optimistic projections from years past . this rapid pace of development has made it difficult to keep up with trends in the marketplace . yet , the need for timely , objective information on the industry and its progress has never been greater . this report— the second of an ongoing annual series attempts — to meet this need by providing a detailed overview of developments and trends in the u.s. wind power market , with a particular focus on 2007. as with the previous edition* , this report begins with an overview of key wind power development and installation-related trends , including trends in capacity growth , in turbine make and model , and among wind power developers , project owners , and power purchasers . it then reviews the price of wind power in the united states , and how those prices compare to the cost of fossilfueled generation , as represented by wholesale power prices . next , the report describes trends in installed wind project costs , wind turbine transaction prices , project performance , and operations and maintenance expenses . finally , the report examines other factors impacting the domestic wind power market , including grid integration costs , transmission issues , and policy drivers . the report concludes with a brief preview of possible developments in 2008. this version of the annual report updates data presented in the previous edition , while highlighting key trends and important new developments from 2007. new to this edition is a section on the contribution of wind power to new capacity additions in the electric sector , data on the amount of wind in utility systems , a summary of trends in wind project size , a discussion of the quantity of wind power capacity in various interconnection queues in the united states , and a section that underscores domestic wind turbine manufacturing investments . a note on scope : this report concentrates on larger-scale wind applications , defined here as individual turbines or projects that exceed 50kw in size . the u.s. wind power sector is multifaceted , however , and also includes smaller ,

annual report on u.s. wind power installation , cost , and performance trends : 2007

u.s. wind power capacity surged by 46 % in 2007 , with 5,329 mw added and $ 9 billion invested
the u.s. wind power market surged in 2007 , shattering previous records , with 5,329 mw of new capacity added , bringing the cumulative total to 16,904 mw ( figure 1 ) . this growth translates into roughly $ 9 billion ( real 2007 dollars ) invested in wind project installations in 2007 , for a cumulative total of nearly $ 28 billion since the 1980s.1 wind installations in 2007 were not only the largest on record in the united states , but were more than twice the previous u.s. record , set in 2006. no country , in any single year , has added the volume of wind capacity that was added to the united states electrical grid in 2007. federal tax incentives , state renewables portfolio standards ( rps ) , concern about global climate change , and continued uncertainty about the future costs and liabilities of natural gas and coal facilities helped spur this intensified growth . the yearly boom-and-bust cycle that characterized the u.s. wind market from 1999 through 2004—caused by periodic , shortterm extensions of the federal production tax credit ( ptc ) —has now been replaced by three consecutive years of sizable growth . with the ptc currently ( as of early-may 2008 ) set to expire at the end of the year , 2008 is expected to be another year of sizable capacity additions . unless the ptc is extended before mid-to-late 2008 , however , a return to the boom-and-bust cycle can be expected in2009 .

distributed wind power

wind turbines installed on the distribution side of the electric grid can provide power directly to homes , farms , schools , businesses , and industrial facilities . distributed wind turbines can also provide power to off-grid sites . distributed wind turbines generally range in size from a few hundred watts up to 100kw or more , and growth in this sector has been driven at least in part—by a variety of state — incentive programs . the table below summarizes sales of distributed wind turbines from 300 w to 100 kw in size into the u.s. market in 2007. as shown , nearly 10 mw of distributed wind turbines were sold in the u.s. , with a slight majority ( in capacity terms ) used in grid-connected applications ; 89 % of this new capacity came from turbines manufactured by u.s. companies , including ( but not limited to ) southwest windpower , bergey windpower , wind turbine industries , entegrity wind systems , and distributed energy systems . these installation figures represent a 14 % growth in annual sales—in capacity terms—relative to 2006 , yielding a cumulative installed capacity of distributed wind in the united states in this turbine size range of roughly 55-60 mw .

wind power contributed 35 % of all new u.s. electric generating capacity in 2007
wind power now represents one of the largest new sources of electric capacity additions in the united states . for the third consecutive year , wind power was the second-largest new resource

added to the u.s. electrical grid in terms of nameplate capacity , behind the 7,500 mw of new natural gas plants , but ahead of the 1,400 mw of new coal . new wind plants contributed roughly 35 % of the new nameplate capacity added to the u.s. electrical grid in 2007 , compared to 19 % in 2006 , 12 % in 2005 , and less than 4 % from 2000 through 2004 ( see figure 2 ) . the eia projects that total u.s. electricity supply will need to increase at an average pace of 47 twh per year from 2008 to 2030 in order to meet demand growth . on an energy basis , the annual

annual report on u.s. wind power installation , cost , and performance trends : 2007

amount of electricity generated by the new wind capacity added in 2007 ( ~16 twh ) represents roughly 35 % of this average annual projected growth in supply.2 by extension , if wind capacity additions continued through 2030 at the same pace as set in 2007 ( 5,329 mw per year ) , then 35 % of the nation ’ s projected additional electricity generation needs from 2008 through 2030 would be met with wind electricity . although future growth trends are hard to predict , it is clear that a significant portion of the country ’ s new generation needs are already being met by wind power .

figure 2. relative contribution of generation types to annual capacity additions

on a worldwide basis , roughly 20,000 mw of wind capacity was added in 2007 , the highest volume achieved in a single year , and up from about 15,000 mw in 2006 , bringing the cumulative total to approximately 94,000 mw . for the third straight year , the united states led the world in wind capacity additions ( table 1 ) , capturing roughly 27 % of the worldwide market , up from 16 % in 2006 ( figure3 ) . china , spain , germany , and india rounded out the top five countries in 2007 for annual wind capacity additions ( table 1 ) .3 in terms of cumulative installed wind capacity , the united states ended the year with 18 % of worldwide capacity , in second place behind germany . so far this decade ( i.e . , over the past eight years ) , cumulative wind power capacity has grown an average of 27 % per year in the united states , equivalent to the same 27 % growth rate in worldwide capacity . several countries are beginning to achieve relatively high levels of wind power penetration in their electricity grids . figure 4 presents data on end-of-2007 ( and end-of-2006 ) installed wind capacity , translated into projected annual electricity supply based on assumed country-specific capacity factors , and divided by projected 2008 ( and 2007 ) electricity consumption . using this rough approximation for the contribution of wind to electricity consumption , and focusing only on the 20 countries with the greatest cumulative installed wind capacity , end-of-2007 installed wind is projected to supply roughly 20 % of denmark ’ s electricity demand

given the relatively low capacity factor of wind , one might initially expect that wind ’ s percentage contribution on an energy basis would be lower than on a capacity basis . this is not necessarily the case , in part because even though combined-cycle gas plants can be operated as baseload facilities with high capacity factors , those facilities are often run as intermediate plants with capacity factors that are not dissimilar from that of wind . combustion turbine facilities run at even lower capacity factors . yearly and cumulative installed wind capacity in the united states are from awea , while global wind capacity comes from btm consult ( but updated with the most recent awea data for the united states ) and , for earlier years , from the earth policy institute . modest disagreement exists among these data sources and others , e.g . , windpower monthly and the global wind energy council . in terms of actual 2007 deliveries , wind represented 0.77 % of net electricity generation in the united states , and roughly 0.72 % of national electricity consumption . these figures are below the 1.2 % figure provided above because 1.2 % is a projection based on end-of-year 2007 wind capacity .

figure 4. approximate wind power penetration in the twenty countries with the greatest installed wind capacity

texas easily exceeded other states in annual capacity growth
new large-scale5 wind turbines were installed in 18 states in 2007. texas dominated in terms of new capacity , with 1,708 mw installed in 2007 alone . as shown in table 2 and figure 5 , other leading states in terms of new capacity include colorado , illinois , oregon , minnesota , washington , and iowa . ten states added more than 100mw each . on a cumulative basis , after surpassing california in 2006 , texas continued to build on its lead in 2007 , with a total of 4,446mw of

wind capacity installed by the end of the year . in fact , texas has more installed wind capacity than all but five countries worldwide . following texas are california , minnesota , iowa , washington , and colorado . sixteen states had more than 100mw of wind capacity as of the end of 2007 , with nine topping 500mw . although all wind projects in the united states to date have been sited on land , offshore development activities continued in 2007 , though not without some tribulations ( see offshore wind development activities , page 9 ) . some states are beginning to realize relatively high levels of wind penetration . table 2 lists the top-20 states based on an estimate of wind generation from end-of-2007 wind capacity ,

divided by total in-state generation in 2007.6 by this ( somewhatcontrived ) metric , two midwestern states lead the list in terms of estimated wind power as a percentage of total in-state generation . specifically , wind capacity installed as of the end of 2007 is estimated , in an average year , to generate approximately 7.5 % of all in-state electricity generation in both minnesota and iowa . four additional states—colorado , south dakota , oregon , and new mexico—surpass the 4 % mark by this metric , while thirteen states exceed 2 % . some utilities are achieving even higher levels of wind penetration into their individual electric systems . table 3 lists the top-20 utilities in terms of aggregate wind capacity on their systems at the
6

end of 2007 , based on data provided by awea . included here are wind projects either owned by or under long-term contract with these utilities for use by their own customers ; short-term renewable electricity and renewable energy certificate contracts are excluded . the table also lists the top-20 utilities based on an estimate of the percentage of retail sales that wind generation represents , using end-of-2007 wind capacity and wind capacity factors that are consistent with the state or region in which these utilities operate , and eia-provided aggregate retail electricity sales for each utility in 2006.7 as shown , three of the listed utility systems are estimated to have achieved in excess of 10 % wind penetration based on this metric , while 15 utilities are estimated to have exceeded 5 % .

to estimate these figures , end-of-2007 wind capacity is translated into estimated annual wind electricity production based on state-specific capacity factors that derive from the project performance data reported later in this report . the resulting state-specific wind production estimates are then divided by the latest data on total in-state electricity generation available from the eia ( i.e . , 2007 ) . the resulting wind penetration estimates shown in table 2 differ from what awea provided in its annual rankings report . the most significant source of these differences is that awea estimates wind generation based on endof-2006 wind capacity , while this report uses end-of-2007 capacity . in addition , berkeley lab uses state-specific wind capacity factor assumptions that differ from those applied by awea . a variety of caveats deserve note with respect to these calculations . first , the utility-specific capacity data that awea released in its annual ranking report are assumed accurate , and are used without independent verification . second , only utilities with 50 mw or more of wind capacity are included in the calculation of wind as a proportion of retail sales . third , projected wind generation based on each utility ’ s installed wind capacity at the end of 2007 is divided by the aggregate national retail sales of that utility in 2006 ( which is the latest full year of utility-specific retail sales data provided by eia ) . fourth , in the case of generation and transmission ( g & t ) cooperatives and power authorities that provide power to other cooperatives and municipal utilities ( but do not directly serve retail load themselves ) , 2006 retail sales from the electric utilities served by those g & t cooperatives and power authorities are used . in some cases , these individual utilities may be buying additional wind power directly from other projects , or may be served by other g & t cooperatives or power authorities that supply wind . in these cases , the penetration percentages shown here may be understated ( or at least somewhat misleading ) . as an example , the “ msr public power agency ” ( msr ) is a joint powers agency created to procure power for municipal utilities in the california cities of modesto , santa clara , and redding . the 200 mw of wind capacity associated with msr in the first column of table 3 ( and the corresponding 8.4 % penetration rate shown in the second column ) represents msr ’ s power purchase agreement with the big horn wind project in washington state . however , two of the three municipal utilities participating in msr purchase additional wind power from california wind projects . the result is that if one were to look at these three municipal utilities individually rather than as a group through msr , their penetration rates would be considerably higher than the 8.4 % shown in table 3 , and all three utilities would be at the top of the rankings : redding would be roughly 24.2 % , santa clara 12.3 % , and modesto 11.8 % . finally , some of the entities shown in table 3 are wholesale power marketing companies that are affiliated with electric utilities . in these cases , estimated wind generation is divided by the retail sales of the power marketing company and any affiliated electric utilities .

offshore wind development activities

in europe , two offshore wind projects , totaling 200 mw , were installed in 2007 , bringing total worldwide offshore wind capacity to 1,077 mw . in contrast , all wind projects built in the united states to date have been sited on land . despite the slow pace of offshore activity , there is some interest in offshore wind in several parts of the united states due to the proximity of offshore wind resources to large population centers , advances in technology , and potentially superior capacity factors . the table on the right provides a listing , by state , of “ active ” offshore project proposals in the united states as of the end of 2007. note that these projects are in various stages of development , and a number are either very early-stage proposals or reflect projects that are already in jeopardy of cancellation ; clearly , considerable subjectivity is required in creating this list of “ active ” proposals .

texas 150 mw several events in 2007 demonstrate that progress continues with offshore wind in the united states . ohio 20 mw specifically , new jersey issued a solicitation to provide financial incentives for an offshore wind project up to 350 mw in size , ohio commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of a 20-mw georgia 10 mw wind project in lake erie , the texas general land office awarded the first four competitively bid total 1,923 mw leases for offshore wind power in the nation ’ s history , and the municipal utility serving the town of source : nrel . hull , massachusetts filed for ( and in february 2008 , received ) initial state approval for four offshore turbines . more recently , rhode island has also issued an rfp for offshore wind . also in 2007 , the draft environmental impact statement for the highly publicized cape wind project in massachusetts reached conclusions favorable to the project , and the u.s. minerals management service made progress in executing its offshore wind regulatory responsibilities . notwithstanding these developments , regulatory delays , turbine supply shortages , high and uncertain project costs , and public acceptance concerns have hampered progress in the offshore wind sector . in 2007 alone , for example , concerns about the high costs of offshore wind resulted in the cancellation of a 500-mw texas project and the likely cancellation of a 150-mw new york facility , and put a 450-mw delaware project in jeopardy ( the latter two projects are included in the table on the right , as they remain at least somewhat “ active ” ) .

data from interconnection queues demonstrate that an enormous amount of wind capacity is under development
one visible testament to the surging interest in wind is the amount of wind power capacity currently working its way through the major interconnection queues across the country . figure 6 provides this information , for wind and other resources , aggregated across eleven wind-relevant independent system operators ( isos ) , regional transmission organizations ( rtos ) , and utilities.8 these data should be interpreted with caution : though placing a project in the interconnection queue is a necessary step in project development , being in the queue does not guarantee that a project will actually be built . in fact , there is a growing recognition that many of the projects currently in interconnection queues are very early in the development process , and that a large number of these projects are unlikely to achieve commercial operations any time soon , if at all.9 even with this important caveat , the amount of wind capacity in the nation ’ s interconnection queues is astounding , and provides

some indication of the number and capacity of projects that are in the planning phase . at the end of 2007 , there were 225gw of wind power capacity within the eleven interconnection queues reviewed for this report—more than 13 times the installed wind capacity in the united states at the end of 2007. this wind capacity represents roughly half of all generating capacity within these queues at that time , and is twice as much capacity as the next-largest resource in these queues ( natural gas ) . moreover , wind ’ s prominent position is a relatively recent phenomenon : 64 % of the total wind capacity in these eleven queues at the end of 2007 first entered the queue in 2007 ( for the non-wind projects , in aggregate , the comparable figure is 52 % ) . much of this wind capacity is planned for the midwest , texas , and pjm regions : wind in the interconnection queues of miso ( 66 gw ) , ercot ( 41 gw ) , and pjm ( 35 gw ) account for nearly two-thirds of the aggregate 225 gw of wind in all eleven queues . at the other end of the spectrum , the northeast exhibits the least amount of wind capacity in the pipeline , with the new york iso ( 7 gw ) and iso-new england ( 2 gw ) together accounting for about 4 % of the aggregate 225 gw . the remaining six queues include spp ( 21 gw ) , california iso ( 19 gw ) , wapa ( 10 gw ) , bpa ( 10 gw ) , pacificorp ( 9gw ) , and xcel ’ s colorado service area ( 4 gw ) .

the queues surveyed include pjm interconnection , midwest independent system operator ( miso ) , new york iso , iso-new england , california iso , electricity reliability council of texas ( ercot ) , southwest power pool ( spp ) , western area power administration ( wapa ) , bonneville power administration ( bpa ) , pacificorp , and xcel energy ( colorado ) . to provide a sense of sample size and coverage , roughly 60 % of the total installed generating capacity ( both wind and non-wind ) in the united states is located within these isos , rtos , and utility service territories . figure 6 only includes projects that were active in the queue at the end of 2007 but that had not yet been built ; suspended projects are not included . ferc held a technical conference in november 2007 focusing on the burgeoning interconnection queues and potential reforms .

ge wind remained the dominant turbine manufacturer , but a growing number of other manufacturers are capturing market share
ge wind remained the dominant manufacturer of wind turbines supplying the u.s. market in 2007 , with 44 % of domestic turbine installations ( down from 47 % in 2006 and 60 % in 2005 ) .10 vestas ( 18 % ) and siemens ( 16 % ) vied for second place in 2007 , with gamesa ( 11 % ) , mitsubishi ( 7 % ) , and suzlon ( 4 % ) playing significant , but lesser , roles ( figure 7 ) . noteworthy developments in 2007 include the growth in gamesa ’ s market share , from just 2 % in 2005 and 2006 to 11 % in 2007 , and siemens ’ loss of market share after a banner year in 2006. also significant is that newcomer clipper installed 48 mw in new york , illinois , and iowa in 2007 , marking the start of serial production of that firm ’ s 2.5-mw “ liberty ” turbine . nordex also re-entered the u.s. market in 2007 , after a several-year hiatus , with 2.5 mw installed in minnesota . interestingly , though not reflected in the data shown here , u.s. developer greenhunter announced in late 2007 an order for 108 1.5-mw chinese-made turbines from mingyang wind power technology , for delivery in 2008 .

market share , delineated in percentage terms , can be misleading in rapidly growing markets . as shown in table 4 , every manufacturer active in the u.s. market saw installations of their turbines grow between 2006 and 2007 , in many cases dramatically . the most significant growth was experienced by ge ( 1,196 mw ) , gamesa ( 524mw ) , and vestas ( 485 mw ) .

soaring demand for wind spurs expansion of u.s. wind turbine manufacturing
the manufacturing of wind turbines and components in the united states remains somewhat limited , in part because of the continued uncertain availability of the federal ptc . as domestic demand for wind turbines continues to surge , however , a growing number of foreign turbine and component manufacturers have begun to localize operations in the united states , and manufacturing by u.s.-based companies is starting to expand . figure 8 presents a ( non-exhaustive ) list of domestic wind turbine and component manufacturing facilities announced or opened in 2007 , and identifies the location of those facilities as well as the location of manufacturing facilities that opened prior to 2007. included in the figure are not only turbine assembly and component manufacturing facilities , but also facilities that meet the needs of other segments of the wind industry ’ s supply chain , such as wind project construction companies , anemometer suppliers , and crane and rigging providers . among the list of facilities opened or announced in 2007 are three owned by major international turbine manufacturers : vestas ( blades in windsor , colorado ) , acciona ( turbine assembly in west branch , iowa ) , and siemens ( blades in fort madison , iowa ) .11 vestas is also known to be exploring sites for a u.s. r & d center . these plants are in addition to facilities opened by several other international turbine manufacturers in previous years , including : gamesa ( blades , towers , and nacelle assembly in ebensburg and fairless hills , pennsylvania ) , suzlon ( blades and nose cones in pipestone , minnesota ) , and mitsubishi ( gearboxes in lake mary , florida ) . among u.s.-based wind turbine manufacturers , ge remains dominant , and has maintained a significant domestic turbine manufacturing presence , in addition to its international facilities that serve both the u.s. and global markets . ge ’ s wind turbine manufacturing facilities in the united states include tehachapi ,

california ( turbine manufacturing ) ; pensacola , florida ( blade technology development , component assembly ) ; erie , pennsylvania and salem , virginia ( components ) ; and greenville , south carolina ( turbine assembly ) . signaling the emergence of new players in the u.s. wind turbine industry , three other u.s.-based turbine manufacturers continued to scale-up their activities in 2007 . • clipper windpower is in the process of significant expansion , with 137 of its 2.5-mw liberty turbines produced in 2007 , up from eight in 2006. clipper expects to produce over 300 turbines in 2008 at its cedar rapids , iowa , manufacturing facility , and cumulative firm turbine orders equaled 825 at the end of january , 2008 . • ctc/dewind commissioned its first 2-mw d8.2 turbine in the united states in march , 2008. ctc acquired dewind in 2006 , and turbine production commenced in december , 2007 at a teco westinghouse manufacturing facility in round rock , texas , with an initial capacity of 400 turbines per year and an order backlog of $ 140 million by the end of january , 2008 . • nordic windpower , a manufacturer of two-bladed turbines , announced that goldman sachs made a significant investment in the company in 2007. nordic subsequently announced the opening of its north american headquarters in berkeley , california , and in early 2008 announced the location of a planned manufacturing facility in pocatello , idaho . figure 8 also shows a considerable number of new component manufacturing facilities announced or opened in 2007 , from both

in addition , in 2008 , fuhrlander announced its decision to build a turbine assembly plant in butte , montana , with an expected 150 jobs .

foreign and domestic firms . all told , the new turbine and component manufacturing facilities opened or announced in 2007 and listed in figure 8 will , if fully implemented as planned , create more than 4,700 jobs . notwithstanding the generally positive outlook for the turbine manufacturing sector , however , impediments faced by manufacturers due to rapid scale-up are apparent . clipper windpower , for example , has had to reinforce some blades , and has experienced problems with some of its drivetrains , slowing shipments in 2007. blade quality and tower manufacturing problems also surfaced at gamesa ’ s pennsylvania manufacturing facilities in 2007 and early 2008 ; suzlon has also recently faced blade problems . turbine manufacturing by ctc/dewind , meanwhile , has faced some delay , at least relative to that company ’ s initial expectations .

table 5 shows how the distribution of turbine size has shifted over time ; 40 % of all turbines installed in 2007 had a nameplate capacity in excess of 1.5 mw , compared to 34 % in 2006 , 24 % in 2004-2005 , and 13 % in 2002-2003. ge ’ s 1.5-mw wind turbine remained by far the nation ’ s most-popular turbine in 2007 , with more than 1,500 units installed .

the average size of wind projects expanded significantly
as the u.s. wind industry has matured and installations have increased , so too has the average size of installed wind projects . projects installed in 2007 averaged nearly 120 mw , roughly double that seen in the 2004-05 period and nearly quadruple that seen in the 1998-99 period.13 this marked increase in average project size may reflect a number of interrelated trends highlighted elsewhere in this report : growing demand for wind driven by economics and policy ; the upward march in turbine size ; the large turbine orders that have become standard practice ; consolidation among wind project developers to support these orders ; and increasing turbine and project costs , which may require taking full advantage of any and 1.65 mw 1.60 mw all economies of scale . whatever the specific cause , larger project sizes reflect an increasingly mature energy source that is beginning to penetrate into the domestic electricity market in a significant way .
2006 1,532 turbines 2,454 mw 2007 3,230 turbines 5,329 mw

average turbine size continued to grow , albeit at a slower pace
the average size of wind turbines installed in the united states in 2007 increased to roughly 1.65 mw ( figure 9 ) , from 1.60 mw in 2006. since 1998-99 , average turbine size has increased by 130 % .12

taking this trend towards larger project size to a new level , several gigawatt-scale projects were announced in 2007. in texas , shell windenergy and luminant are jointly planning a 3,000-mw wind project , while oilman t. boone pickens announced plans for a project of up to 4,000 mw . while these projects should be considered speculative at this early stage , a 1,500-mw wind project being developed by allco and oak creek energy systems in tehachapi , california , has already secured a power purchase agreement with southern california edison .

except for 2006 and 2007 , figure 9 ( as well as a number of the other figures and tables included in this report ) combines data into two-year periods in order to avoid distortions related to small sample size in the ptc lapse years of 2000 , 2002 , and 2004. though not a ptc lapse year , 1998 sample size is also small , and is therefore combined with 1999. projects less than 2 mw in size are excluded from figure 10 so that a large number of single-turbine “ projects ” ( that , in practice , may have been developed as part of a larger , aggregated project ) do not end up skewing the average . for projects defined in phases , each phase is considered to be a separate project . projects that are partially constructed in two different years are counted as coming online in the year in which a clear majority of the capacity was completed . if roughly equal amounts of capacity are built in each year , then the full project is counted as coming online in the later year .

developer consolidation continued at a torrid pace
consolidation on the development end of the wind business continued the strong trend that began in 2005 , and has been motivated , in part , by the increased globalization of the wind sector and the need for capital to manage wind turbine supply constraints . table 6 provides a listing of major acquisition and investment activity among u.s. wind developers in the 2002 through 2007 timeframe.14 as shown , at least 11 significant transactions involving roughly 37,000 mw of in-development wind projects ( also called the development “ pipeline ” ) were announced in 2007 , consistent with 2006 acquisition and investment activity of 12 transactions with a total 34,000 mw in the pipeline . in 2005 , eight transactions totaling nearly 12,000 mw were announced , while only four transactions totaling less than 4,000 mw were completed from 2002 through 2004. a number of large companies have entered the u.s. wind development business in recent years , some through acquisitions , and others through their own development activity or through joint development agreements with others . particularly striking in recent years has been the entrance of large european energy companies into the u.s. market . the two largest developer acquisitions in 2007 , for example , were the purchase of horizon wind by energias de portugal ( from portugal ) and the acquisition of airtricity north america by e.on ag ( from germany ) , summing to nearly $ 4 billion in aggregate .

comfort with and use of innovative financing structures increased
a variety of innovative financing structures have been developed by the u.s. wind industry in recent years to allow projects to fully access federal tax incentives . the two most common structures at the present time are corporate balance-sheet finance ( e.g . , historically used by fpl energy ) and the “ institutional investor flip ” structure involving institutional “ tax equity ” investors.15 with the record-shattering amount of new wind capacity installed in 2007 and the growing presence of foreign developers and owners with little appetite for u.s. tax incentives,16 the need to attract institutional tax equity to the u.s. wind sector has never been greater . the past year has brought both good and bad news on this front . the wind industry received welcome news in october 2007 , when the irs issued “ safe harbor ” guidelines ( i.e . , revenue procedure 2007-65 ) for wind projects utilizing special-allocation partnership flip structures . although various permutations of these types of structures have been used for a number of years to monetize the tax benefits provided to wind projects , tax equity investors have had to absorb the risk that these deals would be challenged by the irs . revenue procedure 2007-65 effectively removed this structural tax risk for projects that adhere to the prescribed investment and allocation limits , and has , through numerical example , legitimized the institutional investor flip structure.17 comfort with this structure has grown to the point where even fpl energy—which has financed the largest fleet of wind projects in the united states primarily on its balance sheet—conducted its first ever project refinancing using third-party tax equity in late 2007. while this event sparked rumors that the u.s. wind giant was running out of tax credit appetite , fpl ’ s own explanation is more benign : the institutional investor flip structure allows fpl to focus on its core strengths—developing and operating wind projects— while capitalizing on the relatively lower cost of institutional tax equity ( pre-flip ) and retaining long-term upside potential ( post-flip ) . the year 2007 also saw the closing of a first-of-its-kind tax equity structure suitable for municipalities and cooperatives interested in long-term wind project ownership . the 205-mw white creek wind project was developed by four publicly owned , tax-exempt utilities in the pacific northwest , in cooperation with several institutional tax investors . by serving as power purchasers and pre-paying ( up-front )

for the minimum projected electricity output of the project over its initial 20 years of project operations , these four publicly owned utilities effectively enabled the project to take advantage of low-cost tax-exempt debt ( used to finance the pre-payments ) as well as the traditional tax benefits afforded to wind projects ( available to the institutional tax investors ) . a post-flip buyout option allows for long-term ownership by the publicly owned utilities . although institutional tax investors were plentiful in 2007 , with more than a dozen active in the market,18 the growing dependence on such third-party investors has left the u.s. wind sector vulnerable to the broader credit crisis that began in earnest towards the end of 2007. as a result of the large losses incurred by the banking industry , institutional tax investors have less taxable income to shelter . this shortage is already being felt in the affordable housing sector—one of the wind sector ’ s main competitors for tax equity—where the yields on affordable housing credits have been driven sharply higher by lack of demand . it remains to be seen whether lackluster tax investor demand will spill over into the wind sector , but at the very least it seems unlikely that the cost of tax equity provided to wind projects will continue to fall in 2008. this is particularly notable because the sizable decline in the cost of tax equity over the past four or five years has partially offset ( by roughly 45 % , according to berkeley lab analysis ) the impact of rising turbine and installed project costs on wind power prices . to the extent that the cost of tax equity has bottomed out or begins to rise , any further project cost increases will be felt more immediately and severely in wind power prices . finally , project-level debt staged a comeback of sorts in 2007 , with a number of projects announcing the use of term ( as opposed to just construction ) debt , even alongside institutional tax equity ( this combination of term debt and tax equity has heretofore been quite rare ) , and in some cases , in quasi-merchant wind projects . one such deal involved three projects in new york state ( scheduled for completion in 2008 ) , aggregated into a single debt facility by the project sponsor . other deals have featured increasingly aggressive terms , with debt providers willing to extend maturities 5 years or more into a project ’ s “ merchant tail ” ( i.e . , the period beyond which the project ’ s power sales have been contracted ) , and at least one deal featuring a 20-year loan term ( including a 5-year merchant tail ) .

ipp project ownership remained dominant , but utility interest in ownership continued , while community wind faltered
private independent power producers ( ipps ) continued to dominate the wind industry in 2007 , owning 83 % of all new capacity ( figure 11 ) . in a continuation of the trend begun several years ago , however , 16 % of total wind additions in 2007 are owned by local electrical utilities , split between investor-owned utilities ( ious ) and publicly owned utilities ( pous ) roughly two-to-one.19 community wind power projects—defined here as projects using turbines over 50 kw in size and completely or partly owned by towns , schools , commercial customers , or farmers , but excluding publicly owned utilities—constitute the remaining 1 % of 2007 projects . of the cumulative 16,904 mw of installed wind capacity at the end of 2007 , ipps owned 84 % ( 14,280 mw ) , with utilities contributing 14 % ( 1,790 mw for ious and 526 mw for pous ) , and community ownership just 2 % ( 308 mw ) . the community wind sector , in particular , has found it difficult to make much headway in the last couple of years , in part due to the difficulty of securing smaller turbine orders amidst the current turbine shortage . that said , state policies specifically targeting community wind and usda section 9006 grants may help boost the community wind numbers in future years .

though long-term contracted sales to utilities remained the most common off-take arrangement , merchant plants and sales to power marketers are becoming more prevalent
investor-owned utilities continued to be the dominant purchasers of wind power , with 48 % of new 2007 capacity and 55 % of cumulative capacity selling power to ious under long-term contracts ( see figure 12 ) . publicly owned utilities have also taken an active role , purchasing the output of 17 % of new 2007 capacity and 15 % of cumulative capacity . for both ious and pous , power purchase agreement ( ppa ) terms for projects built in 2007 range from 15 to 25years , with 20 years being the most common . the role of power marketers—defined here as corporate intermediaries that purchase power under contract and then re-sell that power to others , sometimes taking some merchant risk20– in the wind power market has increased dramatically since 2000 , when such entities first entered the wind sector . in 2007 , power marketers purchased the output of 20 % of new wind power capacity and 17 % of cumulative capacity . among projects built in 2007 , ppas with power marketers range from 5 to 23 years in length , somewhat shorter than the range of utility ppas .

increasingly , owners of wind projects are taking on some merchant risk , meaning that a portion of their electricity sales revenue is tied to short-term 18 contracted and/or spot market 2007 capacity by community owner type prices ( with the resulting price risk 16 publicly owned utility ( pou ) commonly hedged over a 5- to 14 investor-owned utility ( iou ) 10-year period via financial transacindependent power producer ( ipp ) 12 ipp : 4,414 mw tions rather than through ppas21 ) .

compared to the recent past , the growth in publicly owned utility ownership in 2007 is striking . this growth is , arguably , inflated by the categorization of the 205-mw white creek wind project as a pou-owned project . although the four pous involved with the white creek project do not technically own any part of the project unless and until they exercise their purchase option ( after the project ’ s tenth year ) , by pre-paying for a substantial portion of the project ’ s power , these utilities have nevertheless contributed roughly half of the capital required to build the project . this , plus the fact that the financing structure is specifically designed to result in long-term pou ownership ( through the buyout option ) , favors the categorization of this project as pou-owned . power marketers are defined here to include not only traditional marketers such as ppm energy , but also the wholesale power marketing affiliates of large investor-owned utilities ( e.g . , ppl energy plus or firstenergy solutions ) , which may buy wind power on behalf of their load-serving affiliates . hedge providers active in the market in 2007 include fortis , credit suisse , barclay ’ s , j. aron & company , and coral energy holding ( a division of shell ) . these hedges are often structured as a “ fixed-for-floating ” power price swap—a purely financial arrangement whereby the wind project swaps the “ floating ” revenue stream that it earns from spot power sales for a “ fixed ” revenue stream based on an agreed-upon strike price . for at least one project in texas ( where natural gas is virtually always the marginal supply unit ) , the hedge has been structured in the natural gas market rather than the power market , in order to take advantage of the greater liquidity and longer terms available in the forward gas market .

suppressed by the receipt of any available state and federal incentives ( e.g . , the ptc ) , as well as by the value that might be received through the separate sale of renewable energy certificates ( see rec markets remain fragmented and prices volatile , page 18 ) .23 the prices reported here would therefore be higher if wind projects did not have access to these state and federal incentives and , as a result , these prices do not represent wind energy generation costs .

markets exist , where wind power may be able to compete with these spot prices , and where additional revenue is possible from the sale of renewable energy certificates ( recs ) . another interesting development in 2007 was the initiation of cross-border sales of wind electricity into the united states , despite the fact that those facilities are not eligible for u.s. tax incentives . a portion of the west cape wind project , located in price edward island ( new brunswick ) , began exporting power and renewable energy certificates ( recs ) to new england in mid-2007 . later that year , hydro-quebec received permission to sell into new england from two of its wind facilities . finally , san diego gas & electric announced a 20-year contract with the proposed 250-mw larumorosa wind project in baja , mexico .

upward pressure on wind power prices continued in 2007
although the wind industry appears to be on solid footing , the weakness of the dollar , rising materials costs , a concerted movement towards increased manufacturer profitability , and a shortage of components and turbines continued to put upward pressure on wind turbine costs , and therefore wind power prices , in 2007. berkeley lab maintains a database of wind power sales prices , which currently contains price data for 128 projects installed between 1998 and the end of 2007. these wind projects total 8,303mw , or 55 % of the wind capacity brought on line in the united states over the 1998-2007 period . the prices in this database reflect the price of electricity as sold by the project owner , and might typically be considered busbar energy prices.22 the prices are
22 23

based on this database , the capacity-weighted average power sales price from the sample of post-1997 wind projects remains low by historical standards . figure 13 shows the cumulative capacityweighted average wind power price ( plus or minus one standard deviation around that price ) in each calendar year from 1999 through 2007. based on the limited sample of seven projects built in 1998 or 1999 and totaling 450 mw , the weighted-average price of wind in 1999 was nearly $ 63/mwh ( expressed in 2007 dollars ) . by 2007 , in contrast , the cumulative sample of projects built from 1998 through 2007 had grown to 128 projects totaling 8,303 mw , with an average price of just under $ 40/mwh ( with the one standard deviation range extending from $ 24/mwh to $ 55/mwh ) .24 although figure 13 does show a modest increase in the weightedaverage wind power price in 2006 and 2007 , reflecting rising prices from new projects , the cumulative nature of the graphic mutes the degree of increase . to better illustrate changes in the price of power from newly built wind projects , figure 14 shows average wind power sales prices in 2007 , grouped by each project ’ s initial commercial operation date ( cod ) .25 although the limited project sample and the considerable variability in price across projects installed in a given time period complicate analysis of national price trends ( with averages subject to regional and other factors ) , the general trend exhibited by the capacity-weighted-average prices ( i.e . , the blue columns ) nevertheless suggests that , following a general decline since 1998 , prices bottomed out for projects built in 2002 and 2003 , and have since risen significantly.26 given the year-on-year increase in project-level installed costs from 2006 to 2007 ( see a later section of this report ) , however , it comes as some surprise that prices from projects installed in 2007 were , on average , somewhat lower than from projects installed in 2006 .

these prices will typically include interconnection costs and , in some cases , transmission expansion costs that are needed to ensure delivery of the energy to the purchaser . for most of the wind power sales prices reported here , the wind generator is selling electricity and recs in a bundled fashion , and the price reported here therefore reflects the delivery of that bundled product . for at least 10 of the 128 projects in the sample , however , the wind project appears to receive additional revenue ( beyond the power price reported ) from the separate sale of recs . the prices provided in this report do not include this separate rec revenue stream , and therefore understate total sales revenue for these projects . because a minority of projects ( 10 out of 128 ) fall in this category , however , this factor is unlikely to significantly bias the overall results presented in this report . all wind power pricing data presented in this report exclude the few projects located in hawaii . such projects are considered outliers in that they are significantly more expensive to build than projects in the continental united states , and receive a power sales price that is significantly higher than normal , in part because it is linked to the price of oil . for example , the three major wind projects located in hawaii ( totaling 62 mw ) earned revenue in 2007 that ranged from $ 112/mwh to $ 177/mwh on average , which is considerably higher than the price received by most wind projects built on the mainland . prices from two individual projects built during the 2000-2001 period are not shown in figure 14 ( due to the scale of the y-axis ) , but are included in the capacity-weighted average for that period . the omitted prices are roughly $ 91/mwh and $ 150/mwh .

specifically , the capacityweighted average 2007 sales price for projects in the sample built in 2007 was roughly $ 45/mwh ( with a range of $ 30 to $ 65/mwh ) .27 although this price is ( somewhat surprisingly ) slightly less than the average of $ 48/mwh for the sample of projects built in 2006 , it is still higher than the average price of $ 37/mwh for the sample of projects built in 2004 and 2005 , as well as the $ 32/mwh for the sample of projects built in 2002 and 2003. moreover , because ongoing turbine price increases are not fully reflected in 2007 wind project prices—many of these projects had locked in turbine prices and/ or negotiated power purchase agreements as much as 18 to 24 months earlier—prices from projects being built in 2008 and beyond may be higher still .

although it may seem counterintuitive , the weighted-average price in 1999 for projects built in 1998 and 1999 ( shown in figure 13 to be about $ 63/mwh ) is significantly higher than the weighted-average price in 2007 for projects built in 1998 and 1999 ( shown in figure 14 to be $ 39/mwh ) for three reasons : ( 1 ) the sample size is larger in figure 14 , due to the fact that 2007 prices are presented , rather than 1999 prices as in figure 13 ( i.e . , we were unable to obtain early-year pricing for some of the projects built in 1998-1999 ) ; ( 2 ) two of the larger projects built in 1998 and 1999 ( for which both 1999 and 2007 prices are available , meaning that these projects are represented within both figures ) have nominal ppa prices that actually decline , rather than remaining flat or escalating , over time ; and ( 3 ) inflating all prices to constant 2007 dollar terms impacts older ( i.e . , 1999 ) prices more than it does more recent ( i.e . , 2007 ) prices . if the federal ptc was not available , wind power prices for 2007 projects would range from approximately $ 50/mwh to $ 85/mwh , with an average of roughly $ 65/mwh . it is also possible that regions with higher wholesale power prices will , in general , yield higher wind contract prices due to arbitrage opportunities on the wholesale market . it may be surprising to some that relatively little pricing data are available for texas , despite the enormous growth in wind capacity in that state . the reason is simple : because ercot is not electrically connected to the remainder of the u.s. grid , generators located within ercot are not required to file pricing information with ferc . the pricing information for texas provided in this report comes primarily from projects located in the texas panhandle , which is covered by the southwest power pool rather than ercot .

avg monthly rec price ( 2007 $ /mwh )

most of the wind power transactions identified in figures 13 through 15 reflect the bundled sale of both electricity and recs , but for at least 10 of these projects , recs may be sold separately to earn additional revenue . rec markets are highly fragmented in the united states , but consist of two distinct segments : compliance markets in which recs are purchased to meet state rps obligations , and green power markets in which recs are purchased on a voluntary basis . the year 2007 saw the completion of two new regional electronic rec tracking systems : the western renewable energy generation information system ( wregis ) and the midwest renewable energy tracking system ( mrets ) . as such , electronic rec tracking systems are now widespread , with operational systems in new england , the pjm interconnection , texas , the western electricity coordinating council , and the upper midwest , and another system under development in new york . the figures to the right present indicative monthly data on spot-market rec prices in both compliance and voluntary markets ; data for compliance markets focus on the “ class i ” or “ main tier ” of the rps policies . clearly , spot rec prices have varied substantially , both among states and over time within individual states . key trends in 2007 compliance markets include continued high prices to serve the massachusetts rps , dramatically increasing prices under the connecticut rps , high initial prices to serve the rhode island rps , and a large spike in the price for class i certificates under the new jersey rps . prices remained relatively low in texas , maryland , pennsylvania , and washington d.c. due to a surplus of eligible renewable energy supply relative to rps-driven demand in those markets . despite low rec prices in texas , the combination of high wholesale power prices and the possibility of additional rec revenue increased merchant wind activity in that state in 2007. recs offered in voluntary markets ranged from less than $ 5/mwh to more than $ 10/mwh in 2007 , with strong upward movement in western rec prices . 18

a simple comparison of the wind prices presented in the previous section to recent wholesale power prices throughout the united states demonstrates that wind power prices have been competitive with wholesale power market prices over the past few years . figure 17 shows the range ( minimum and maximum ) of average annual wholesale power prices for a flat block of power30 going back to 2003 at twenty-three different pricing nodes located throughout the country ( refer to figure 16 for the names and approximate locations of the twenty-three pricing nodes represented by the blue-shaded area31 ) . the red dots show the cumulative capacity-weighted-average price received by wind projects in each year among those projects in the sample with commercial operation dates of 1998 through 2007 ( consistent with the data first presented in figure 13 ) . at least on a cumulative basis within the

sample of projects reported here , average wind power prices have consistently been at or below the low end of the wholesale power price range . though figure 17 shows that—on average—wind projects installed from 1998 through 2007 have , since 2003 at least , been priced at or below the low end of the wholesale power price range on a nationwide basis , there are clearly regional differences in wholesale power prices and in the average price of wind power . these variations are reflected in figure 18 , which focuses on 2007 wind and wholesale power prices in the same regions as shown earlier , based on the entire sample of wind projects installed from 1998 through 2007.32 although there is quite a bit of variability within some regions , in most regions the average wind power price was below the range of average wholesale prices in 2007 .

to try to control for the fact that wind power prices have risen in recent years , figure 19 focuses just on those projects in the sample that were built in 2006 and 2007 ( as opposed to 1998 through 2007 ) . at this level of granularity , sample size is clearly an 80 wind project sample includes issue in most regions . 70 projects built from 1998-2007 nevertheless , while there is 60 greater convergence between 50 wind and wholesale prices in 40 this instance , power prices 30 from wind projects built in 20 nationwide wholesale power price range ( for a flat block of power ) 2006 and 2007 still appear , for cumulative capacity-weighted-average wind power price 10 the most part , to be either 0 within or below the range of 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2007 wholesale power prices . 53 projects 66 projects 87 projects 107 projects 128 projects rising wholesale power prices 2,466 mw 3,267 mw 4,396 mw 5,801 mw 8,303 mw since earlier in the decade source : ferc 2006 and 2004 `` state of the market '' reports , berkeley lab database , ventyx . have , to a degree , mitigated figure 17. average cumulative wind and wholesale power prices over time the impact of rising wind power prices on wind ’ s 80 competitive position .

figure 18. wind and wholesale power prices by region : 1998-2007 projects

notwithstanding the comparisons made in figures 17-19 , it should be recognized that neither the wind nor wholesale power prices presented in this section reflect the full social costs of power generation and delivery . specifically , the wind power prices are suppressed by virtue of federal and , in some cases , state tax and financial incentives ( a few

though wind projects do not provide a perfectly flat block of power , as a common point of comparison , a flat block is not an unreasonable starting point . in other words , the time-variability of wind generation is often such that its wholesale market value is not too dissimilar from that of a flat block of ( non-firm ) power . the five pricing nodes represented in figure 16 by an open rather than closed bullet do not have complete pricing history back through 2003. although their prices are factored into the capacity-weighted-average wind power price ( depicted by the red dash ) , two individual projects are not shown in figure 18 , due to scale limitations : one in the great lakes region , at roughly $ 91/mwh ; and one in the east , at roughly $ 150/mwh .

projects also receive additional revenue from unbundled rec sales ) . furthermore , these prices do not fully reflect integration , resource adequacy , or transmission costs . at the same time , wholesale power prices do not fully reflect transmission costs , may not fully reflect capital and fixed operating costs , and are suppressed by virtue of any financial incentives provided to fossil-fueled generation and by not fully accounting for the environmental and social costs of that generation . in addition , wind power prices—once established—are typically fixed and known , whereas wholesale power prices are short-term and therefore subject to change over time . finally , the location of the wholesale pricing nodes and the assumption of a flat block of power are not perfectly consistent with the location and output profile of the sample of wind projects . in short , comparing wind and wholesale power prices in this manner is spurious , if one ’ s goal is to fully account for the costs and benefits of wind relative to its competition . another way to think of figures 17-19 , however , is as loosely representing the decision facing wholesale power purchasers—i.e . , whether to contract long-term for wind power or buy a flat block of ( non-firm ) spot power on the wholesale market . in this sense , the costs represented in figures 17-19 are reasonably comparable in that they represent ( to some degree , at least ) what the power purchaser would actually pay .

project performance and capital costs drive wind power prices
wind power sales prices are affected by a number of factors , two of the most important of which are installed project costs and project performance.33 figures 20 and 21 illustrate the importance of these two variables . figure 20 shows the relationship between project-level installed costs and power sales prices in 2007 for a sample of more than 7,200mw of wind projects installed in the united states from 1998 through 2007.34 though the scatter is considerable , in general , projects with higher installed costs also have higher wind power prices . figure 21 illustrates the relationship between project-level capacity factors in 2007 and power sales prices in that same year for a sample of more than 5,700 mw of wind projects installed from 1998 through 2006. the inverse relationship shows that projects with higher capacity factors generally have lower wind power prices , though considerable scatter is again apparent . the next few sections of this report explore trends in installed costs and project performance in more detail , as both factors can have significant effects on wind power prices .

operations and maintenance ( o & m ) costs are another important variable that affects wind power prices . a later section of this report covers trends in project-level o & m costs . in both figures 20 and 21 , two project outliers ( the same two described earlier ) are obscured by the compressed scales , yet still influence the trend lines .

installed project costs continued to rise in 2007 , after a long period of decline
berkeley lab has compiled a sizable database of the installed costs of wind projects in the united states , including data on 36 projects completed in 2007 totaling 4,079 mw , or 77 % of the wind power capacity installed in that year . in aggregate , the dataset includes 227 completed wind projects in the continental united states totaling 12,998 mw , and equaling roughly 77 % of all wind capacity installed in the united states at the end of 2007. the dataset also includes cost projections for a sample of proposed projects . in general , reported project costs reflect turbine purchase and installation , balance of plant , and any substation and/or interconnection expenses . data sources are diverse , however , and are not all of equal credibility , so emphasis should be placed on overall trends in the data , rather than on individual project-level estimates .
installed project cost ( 2007 $ /kw ) $ 4,500 $ 4,000 $ 3,500 $ 3,000 $ 2,500 $ 2,000 $ 1,500 $ 1,000 $ 500 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 $ 0

as shown in figure 22 , wind project installed costs declined dramatically from the beginnings of the industry in california in the 1980s to the early 2000s , falling by roughly $ 2,700/kw over this period.35 more recently , however , costs have increased . among the sample of projects built in 2007 , reported installed costs ranged from $ 1,240/kw to $ 2,600/kw , with an average cost of $ 1,710/kw . this average is up $ 140/kw ( 9 % ) from the average cost of installed projects in 2006 ( $ 1,570/kw ) , and up roughly $ 370/kw ( 27 % ) from the average cost of projects installed from 2001 through 2003. project costs are clearly on the rise . moreover , there is reason to believe that recent increases in turbine costs did not fully work their way into installed project costs in 2007 , and therefore that even higher installed costs are likely in the near future . the average cost estimate for 2,950 mw of proposed projects in the dataset ( not shown in figure 22 , but most of which are expected to be built in 2008 ) , for example , is $ 1,920/kw , or $ 210/kw higher than for projects completed in 2007 .

project costs may be influenced by a number of factors , including project size . focusing only on those projects completed in 2006 and 2007 ( to try to remove the confounding effect of rising costs over the past few years ) , figure 23 tries to identify the existence of individual project cost ( 227 online projects totaling 12,998 mw ) project-level economies of scale . average project cost polynomial trend line there is clearly a wider spread in project-level costs among smaller wind projects than among larger projects , but figure 23 does not show strong evidence of economies of scale.36 given the wide spread in the data , it is clear that other factors must play a major role in determining installed project costs .

limited sample size early on – particularly in the 1980s – makes it difficult to pin down this number with a high degree of confidence . this may simply be an artifact of the limited quantity and quality of available data , and the influence of other confounding factors . alternatively , it may be that economies of scale are evident in turbine transactions ( larger turbine orders yielding lower prices ) , but those economies do not necessarily correspond with project size because a large turbine order could be used for either one large project or allocated among multiple smaller projects .

differences in installed costs exist regionally due to variations in development costs , transportation costs , siting and permitting requirements and timeframes , and balance-ofplant and construction expenditures . considering projects in the sample installed in 2004 through 2007 , figure 24 shows that average costs equaled $ 1,540/kw nationwide over this period , but varied somewhat by region . new england was the highest cost region , while the heartland was the lowest.37 finally , it is important to recognize that wind is not alone in seeing upward pressure on project costs—other types of power plants have seen similar increases in capital costs in recent years . in september 2007 , for example , the edison foundation published a report showing increases in the installed cost of both natural gas and coal power plants that rival that seen in the wind industry.38

project cost increases are a function of turbine prices , and turbine prices have increased dramatically
increases in wind power prices and overall installed project costs mirror increases in the cost of wind turbines . berkeley lab has gathered data on 49 u.s. wind turbine transactions totaling 16,600mw , including 16 transactions summing to 7,600 mw in 2007 alone . figure 25 depicts these reported wind turbine transaction prices . sources of transaction price data vary , but most derive from press releases and press reports . wind turbine transactions differ in the services offered ( e.g . , whether towers and installation are provided , the length of the service agreement , etc . ) and on the timing of future turbine delivery , driving some of the observed intrayear variability in transaction prices . nonetheless , most of the transactions included in the berkeley lab dataset likely include turbines , towers , erection , and limited warranty and service agreements ; unfortunately , because of data limitations , the precise content of many of the individual transactions is not known .

since hitting a nadir of roughly $ 700/kw in the 2000-2002 period , turbine prices appear to have increased by approximately $ 600/kw ( 85 % ) , on average . between 2006 and 2007 , capacity-weightedaverage turbine prices increased by roughly $ 115/kw ( 10 % ) , from $ 1,125/kw to $ 1,240/kw . recent increases in turbine prices have likely been caused by several factors , including the declining value of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro , increased materials and energy input prices ( e.g . , steel and oil ) , a general move by manufacturers to improve their profitability , shortages in certain turbine components , an up-scaling of turbine size ( and hub height ) , and improved sophistication of turbine design ( e.g . , improved grid interactions ) . the shortage of turbines has also led to a secondary market in turbines , through which prices may be even higher than those shown in figure 25. though by no means definitive , figure 25 also suggests that larger turbine orders ( > 300 mw ) may have generally yielded somewhat lower pricing than smaller orders ( < 100 mw ) at any given point in time . this is reflected in the fact that most of the larger turbine orders shown in figure 25 are located below the polynomial trend line , while the majority of the smaller orders are located above that line .

37

graphical presentation of the data in this way should be viewed with some caution , as numerous factors influence project costs ( e.g . , whether projects are repowered vs. “ greenfield ” development , etc . ) . as a result , actual cost differences among some regions may be more ( or less ) significant than they appear in figure 24. see : www.edisonfoundation.net/rising_utility_construction_costs.pdf

figure 25. reported u.s. wind turbine transaction prices over time

( 91 % of nationwide installed wind capacity at the end of 2006 ) .39 though capacity factors are not an ideal metric of project performance due to variations in the design and rating of wind turbines , absent rotor diameter data for each project , this report is unable to present the arguably more-relevant metric of electricity generation per square meter of swept rotor area . both figures and the table summarize project-level capacity factors in the year 2007 , thereby limiting the effects of inter-annual fluctuations in the nationwide wind resource.40

this trend of increasing turbine prices suggests that virtually the entire recent rise in installed project costs reported earlier has come from turbine price increases ( recognizing that these prices reflect the cost of turbines , towers , and erection ) . in fact , because projectlevel installed costs have increased , on average , by roughly $ 370/kw during the last several years , while turbine prices appear to have increased by $ 600/kw over the same time span , further increases in project costs should be expected in the near future as the increases in turbine prices flow through to project costs .

figure 26 shows individual project as well as capacity-weighted average 2007 capacity factors broken out by each project ’ s commercial operation date . the capacity-weighted-average 2007 capacity factors in the berkeley lab sample increased from 22 % for wind projects installed before 1998 to roughly 30 % -32 % for projects installed from 1998-2003 , and to roughly 33 % -35 % for projects installed in 2004-2006 . 41 in the best wind resource areas , capacity factors in excess of 40 % are increasingly common . of the 112 projects in the sample installed prior to 2004 , for example , only 4 ( 3.6 % ) had capacity factors in excess of 40 % in 2007 ( in capacity terms , 56 mw , or 1 % , exceeded 40 % ) . of the 58 projects installed from 2004 through 2006 , on the other hand , 15 ( 25.9 % ) achieved capacity factors in excess of 40 % in 2007 ( in capacity terms , 836 mw , or 16.7 % , exceeded 40 % ) . these increases in capacity factors over time suggest that improved turbine designs , higher hub heights , and/or improved siting are outweighing the otherwise-presumed trend towards

wind project performance has improved over time
though recent turbine and installed project cost increases have driven wind power prices higher , improvements in wind project performance have mitigated these impacts to some degree . in particular , capacity factors have 50 % increased for projects installed 40 % in recent years , driven by a combination of higher hub 30 % heights , improved siting , and technological advancements . 20 % figures 26 and 27 , as well as table 7 , present excerpts from a berkeley lab compilation of wind project capacity-factor data . the sample consists of 170 projects built between 1983 and 2006 , and totaling 10,564 mw

though some performance data for wind projects installed in 2007 are available , those data do not span an entire year of operations . as such , for the purpose of this section , the focus is on project-level 2007 capacity factors for projects with commercial online dates in 2006 and earlier . focusing just on 2007 means that the absolute capacity factors shown in figure 26 may not be representative if 2007 was not a representative year in terms of the strength of the wind resource . note also that by including only 2007 capacity factors , variations in the quality of the wind resource year in 2007 across regions could skew the regional results presented in figure 27 and table 7. the capacity-weighted-average 2007 capacity factor for projects installed in 2006 ( 33.4 % ) is down slightly from that for projects installed in 2004-2005 ( 34.8 % ) , in large part due to the impact of a single large project . specifically , a very large 2006 project in texas achieved a capacity factor of just 28.7 % in 2007 ; if this single project were excluded from the sample , the capacity-weighted-average 2007 capacity factor from projects built in 2006 would rise to 35.7 % ( up from 34.8 % for projects built in 2004-2005 ) . the impact of this single project is also evident in figure 27 ( where the capacity-weighted-average for texas is at the low end of the individual project range ) and table 7 ( where the steady upward march of average capacity factors in texas is abruptly reversed in 2006 ) .

lower-value wind resource sites as the best locations are developed . further analysis would be needed to determine the relative importance of the variables influencing performance improvements . although the overall trend is towards higher capacity factors , the project-level spread shown in figure 26 is enormous , with capacity factors ranging from 18 % to 48 % among projects built in the same year , 2006. some of this spread is attributable to regional variations in wind resource quality . figure 27 shows the regional variation in 2007 capacity factors , based on a sub-sample of wind projects built from 2002 through 2006. for this sample of projects , capacity factors are the highest in hawaii ( though just two projects ) and the heartland ( above 35 % on average ) , and lowest in new england , the great lakes , and the east ( below 30 % on average ) . given the small sample size in some regions , however , as well as the possibility that certain regions may have experienced a particularly good or bad wind resource year in 2007 , care should be taken in extrapolating these results . though limited sample size is again a problem for many regions , table 7 illustrates trends in 2007 capacity factors for projects with different commercial operation dates , by region . in the heartland region , with the largest sample of projects in terms of installed 24

capacity , the average capacity factor of projects installed in 2006 ( 40.8 % ) is approximately 35 % greater than that of the 1998-1999 vintage projects in the sample ( 30.2 % ) .

operations and maintenance costs are affected by the age and size of the project , among other factors
operations and maintenance ( o & m ) costs are a significant component of the overall cost of wind projects , but can vary widely among projects . market data on actual project-level o & m costs for wind plants are scarce . even where these data are available , care must be taken in extrapolating historical o & m costs given the dramatic changes in wind turbine technology that have occurred over the last two decades , not least of which has been the up-scaling of turbine size ( see figure 9 , earlier ) . berkeley lab has compiled o & m cost data for 95 installed wind plants in the united states , totaling 4,319 mw of capacity , with commercial operation dates of 1982 through 2006. these data cover

facilities owned by both independent power producers and utilities , though data since 2004 is exclusively from utility-owned plants . a full-time series of o & m cost data , by year , is available for only a small number of projects ; in all other cases , o & m cost data are available for just a subset of years of project operations . although the data sources do not all clearly define what items are included in o & m costs , in most cases the reported values appear to include the costs of wages and materials associated with operating and maintaining the facility , as well as rent ( i.e . , land lease payments ) . other ongoing expenses , including taxes , property insurance , and workers ’ compensation insurance , are generally not included . given the scarcity and varying quality of the data , caution should be taken when interpreting the results shown below . note also that the available data are presented in $ /mwh terms , as if o & m represents a variable cost . in fact , o & m costs are in part variable and in part fixed . 42 figure 28 shows project-level o & m costs by year of project installation ( i.e . , the last year that original equipment was installed , or the last year of project repowering ) . here , o & m costs represent an average of annual project-level data available for the years 2000 through 2007. for example , for projects that reached commercial operations in 2006 , only year 2007 data are available , and that is what is shown in the figure.43 many other projects only have data for a subset of years during the 2000-2007 period , either because they were installed after 2000 or because a full-time series is not available , so each data point in the chart may represent a different averaging period over the 2000-07 timeframe . the chart also identifies which of the data points contain the most-updated data , from 2007. the data exhibit considerable spread , demonstrating that o & m costs are far from uniform across projects . however , figure 28 suggests that projects installed more recently have , on average , incurred much lower o & m costs . specifically , capacity-weightedaverage 2000-2007 o & m costs for projects in the sample constructed in the 1980s equal $ 30/mwh , dropping to $ 20/mwh for projects installed in the 1990s , and to $ 9/mwh for projects installed
projects with no 2007 o & m data projects with 2007 o & m data

in the 2000s . this drop in o & m costs may be due to a combination of at least two factors : ( 1 ) o & m costs generally increase as turbines age , component failures become more common , and as manufacturer warranties expire44 ; and ( 2 ) projects installed more recently , with larger turbines and more sophisticated designs , may experience lower overall o & m costs on a per-mwh basis . to help tease out the possible influence of these two factors , figure 29 shows annual o & m costs over time , based on the number of years since the last year of equipment installation . annual data for projects of similar vintages are averaged together , and data for projects under 5 mw in size are excluded ( to help control for the confounding influence of economies of scale ) . note that , for each group , the number of projects used to compute the average annual values shown in the figure is limited , and varies substantially ( from 3 to 21 data points per project-year for projects installed in 1998 through 2000 ; 10 data points per project-year for projects installed in 2001 through 2003 ; and from 3 to 6 data points for projects installed in 2004 through 2006 ) . with this limitation in mind , the figure appears to show that projects installed in 2001 and later have had lower o & m costs than those installed from 1998 through 2000 , at least during the initial two years of operation . in addition , the data for projects installed from 1998 through 2000 show a quite modest upward trend in project-level o & m costs after the third year of project operation , though the sample size after year four is quite limited . another variable that may impact o & m costs is project size . figure 30 presents average o & m costs for 2000 through 2007 ( as in figure 28 ) relative to project size . though substantial spread in the data exists and the sample is too small for definite conclusions , project size does appear to have some impact on average o & m costs , with higher costs typically experienced by smaller projects . more data would be needed to confirm this inference . though interesting , the trends noted above are not necessarily useful predictors of long-term o & m costs for the latest turbine models . the u.s. doe , in collaboration with the wind industry , is currently funding additional efforts to better understand the drivers for o & m costs and component failures , and to develop models to project future o & m costs and failure events .

although not presented here , expressing o & m costs in units of $ /kw-yr was found to yield qualitatively similar results . projects installed in 2007 are not shown because only data from the first full year of project operations ( and afterwards ) are used , which in the case of projects installed in 2007 would be year 2008 ( for which data are not yet available ) . many of the projects installed more recently may still be within their turbine manufacturer warranty period , in which case the o & m costs reported here may or may not include the costs of the turbine warranty , depending on whether the warranty is paid up-front as part of the turbine purchase , or is paid over time .

and costs . key trends among some of the more recent studies include evaluating even higher levels of wind penetration , evaluating the integration of wind within larger electricity market areas , and identifying approaches to mitigate integration concerns .

new studies continued to find that integrating wind into power systems is manageable , but not costless

during the past several years , there has been a considerable amount of analysis on the potential impacts of wind energy on power systems , typically responding to concerns about whether the electrical grid can accommodate significant new wind additions , and at what cost . the sophistication of these studies has increased in recent years , resulting in a better accounting of wind ’ s impacts

additional wind integration research is planned for 2008. perhaps of greatest import is that the national renewable energy laboratory is in the process of examining higher levels of wind penetration in larger electrical footprints . the western wind and solar integration study ( wwsis ) , in collaboration with ge and westconnect , is analyzing wind penetration levels of up to 30 % on an energy basis in the westconnect footprint , which includes parts of wyoming , colorado , new mexico , arizona , and nevada . the eastern wind integration study , to be conducted in collaboration

some of the studies included in the table also address capacity valuation for resource adequacy purposes ; those results are not presented here . two major integration studies for california were also completed in 2007 : one conducted by the california iso and another by the california energy commission ’ s intermittency analysis project . neither of these studies sought to comprehensively calculate integration costs , however , so neither is listed in the table . wind penetration on a capacity basis ( defined as nameplate wind capacity serving a region divided by that region ’ s peak electricity demand ) is frequently used in integration studies . for a given amount of wind capacity , penetration on a capacity basis is typically higher than the comparable wind penetration in energy terms . the relatively low cost estimate in the 2006 minnesota study , despite an aggressive level of wind penetration , is partly a result of relying on the overall midwest independent system operator ( miso ) market to accommodate certain elements of integrating wind into system operations . the low costs found in the 2006 california study arise because of the large electrical market in which wind power is integrated , as well as the relatively low penetration level analyzed . conversely , the higher integration costs found by avista and idaho power are , in part , caused by the relatively smaller markets in which the wind is being absorbed and , in part , by those utilities ’ operating practices ( specifically , that sub-hourly markets are not used , as is common in isos and rtos ) . note also that the rigor with which the various studies have been conducted has varied , as has the degree of peer review . even outside of isos and rtos , there is increasing interest in collaborative system control actions among balancing areas to address market operations inefficiencies , including helping to mitigate the impact of wind variability on systems operation and cost . in the west , for example , the area control error ( ace ) diversity interchange project has sought to pilot the pooling of individual aces to take advantage of control error diversity .

with the joint coordinated system plan ( whose participants include miso , spp , tva , and pjm ) , will examine a similar wind penetration in the combined footprint of these rtos and isos.49 finally , in 2008 , ercot will issue a study by ge on the potential impact of wind development on ercot ’ s ancillary service requirements .

for inaccurate scheduling of wind generation , and interconnection queuing procedures . a number of federal , state , and regional developments occurred in 2007 that may help ease the transmission barrier for wind over time . at the federal level , the u.s. doe issued its national electric transmission congestion report , which designates two constrained corridors : the southwest area national interest electric transmission corridor and the mid-atlantic area national interest electric transmission corridor . under the energy policy act of 2005 , ferc can approve proposed new transmission facilities in these corridors if states fail to do so within one year , among other conditions . the u.s. doe ’ s designations have proven controversial , however , and multiple efforts to reverse these designations have occurred or are underway . also at the federal level , in february 2007 , ferc issued order 890 , which includes several provisions of importance to wind . first , the order adopts a cost-based energy imbalance policy that replaces the penalty-based energy imbalance charges that applied under ferc order 888 and that were much more punitive for wind . second , the order requires transmission providers to participate in an open transmission planning process at the local and regional level . third , if transmission capacity is unavailable to service a firm point-to-point transmission application , then the transmission provider is required to examine redispatch and conditional firm service as alternative transmission service options . more recently , ferc has begun to investigate ways to ease barriers imposed by current interconnection queuing procedures ; more activity on this topic is expected in 2008. states and grid operators are also increasingly taking more proactive steps to encourage transmission investment , often

solutions to transmission barriers began to emerge , but constraints remain
after a prolonged period of relatively little transmission investment , expenditures on new transmission are on the rise . the edison electric institute , for example , projects that its member companies will invest $ 37 billion in transmission from 2007-2010 , a 55 % increase from the 2003-2006 period . nonetheless , lack of transmission availability remains a primary barrier to wind development . new transmission facilities are particularly important for wind power because wind projects are constrained to areas with adequate wind speeds , which are often located at a distance from load centers . in addition , there is a mismatch between the short lead time needed to develop a wind project and the lengthier time often needed to develop new transmission lines . moreover , the relatively low capacity factor of wind can lead to underutilization of new transmission lines that are intended to only serve this resource . the allocation of costs for new transmission investment is also of critical importance for wind development , as are issues of transmission rate “ pancaking ” when power is wheeled across multiple utility systems , charges imposed

within the context of growing renewable energy demands . several examples of these initiatives are presented below : • texas : in october 2007 , the texas public utilities commission ( puc ) issued an interim order designating five competitive renewable energy zones ( crez ) , defined as areas of high-quality renewable resources to which transmission could be built in advance of installed generation . these crezs could stimulate as much as 22,806 mw of new wind power capacity , and ercot has subsequently completed a transmission study for these areas . • colorado : legislation enacted in january 2007 requires utilities to submit biennial reports designating energy resource zones ( erzs ) and to submit applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity ( cpcn ) for these areas . in october 2007 , xcel energy identified four potential erz areas , created in large measure to support renewable energy development , and the colorado puc recently approved xcel ’ s application for a 345-kv line in northeastern colorado.50 • california : in late 2007 , the california iso received ferc approval for a new transmission interconnection category for locationconstrained resources , such as renewable energy facilities . once a resource area has been identified , transmission would be built in advance of generation being developed , and costs would be initially recovered through the california iso transmission charge . california also started the renewable energy transmission initiative to help define renewable energy zones in and around the state , and to prepare transmission plans for those zones . progress was also made in 2007 on a number of specific transmission projects that are designed to , in part , support wind power . in march 2007 , for example , the california puc approved the first three of ultimately 11 segments of southern california edison ’ s tehachapi transmission project . fully developed , the project will transmit up to 4,500 mw of wind power . in minnesota , meanwhile , utilities that are part of the capx 2020 statewide transmission planning group filed applications at the minnesota puc for four 345-kv lines that will collectively increase transmission capacity in southwestern minnesota by 800 mw , to about 2,000 mw total . finally , a number of states have created transmission infrastructure authorities to support new transmission investment ; 51 two of these states—colorado and new mexico—created transmission authorities in 2007 in large measure to support renewable energy .

in 2007 ( adjusted annually for inflation ) . the importance of the ptc to the u.s. wind industry is illustrated by the pronounced lulls in wind capacity additions in the three years—2000 , 2002 , and 2004—in which the ptc lapsed ( see figure 1 ) . with the ptc currently ( as of early-may 2008 ) scheduled to expire at the end of 2008 , the u.s. wind industry may experience another quiet year in 2009 absent an imminent extension . a number of other federal policies also support the wind industry . wind power property , for example , may be depreciated for tax purposes over an accelerated 5-year period , with bonus depreciation allowed for certain projects completed in 2008. because tax-exempt entities are unable to take direct advantage of tax incentives , the energy policy act of 2005 created the clean renewable energy bond ( creb ) program , effectively offering interest-free debt to eligible renewable projects ( though not without certain additional transaction costs ) .52 finally , the usda provides grants to certain renewable energy applications . state policies also continue to play a substantial role in directing the location and amount of wind development . from 1999 through 2007 , for example , more than 55 % of the wind power capacity built in the u.s. was located in states with rps policies ; in 2007 alone , this proportion was more than 75 % . utility resource planning requirements in western and midwestern states have also helped spur wind additions in recent years , as has growing voluntary customer demand for “ green ” power , especially among commercial customers . state renewable energy funds provide support for wind projects , as do a variety of state tax incentives . finally , concerns about the possible impacts of global climate change are fueling interest by states , regions , and the federal government to implement carbon reduction policies , a trend that is likely to increasingly underpin wind power expansion in the years ahead . key policy developments in 2007 included : • in february 2008 , the irs announced the distribution of roughly $ 400 million in crebs , based on applications received in 2007 , including $ 170 million for 102 wind power projects . • in september 2007 , a total of more than $ 18 million in grant and loan awards were announced under the usda ’ s section 9006 grant program , including $ 2.7 million for 7 “ large wind ” projects totaling 8.2 mw in capacity . • illinois , new hampshire , north carolina , and oregon enacted mandatory rps policies in 2007 , while ohio established an rps in early 2008 , bringing the total to 26 states and washington d.c. ( see figure 31 ) . a large number of additional states strengthened previously established rps programs in 2007 . • a variety of states and regions continued to make progress in implementing carbon reduction policies , and a rising number of electric utilities considered the possible implementation of carbon regulation in their resource planning and selection processes . • state renewable energy funds , state tax incentives , utility resource planning requirements , and green power markets all helped contribute to wind expansion in 2007 .

policy efforts continued to affect the amount and location of wind development
a variety of policy drivers have been important to the recent expansion of the wind power market in the united states . most obviously , the continued availability of the federal ptc has sustained industry growth . first established by the energy policy act of 1992 , the ptc provides a 10-year credit at a level that equaled 2.0¢/kwh

in 2008 , xcel energy reached a settlement with interveners to submit cpcn applications for new transmission facilities in all four erz areas by march 2009. these include colorado , idaho , kansas , north dakota , new mexico , south dakota , and wyoming . such entities have also been eligible to receive the renewable energy production incentive ( repi ) , which offers a 10-year cash payment equal in face value to the ptc , but the need for annual appropriations and insufficient funding have limited the effectiveness of the repi .

coming up in 2008
though transmission availability , siting and permitting conflicts , and other barriers remain , 2008 is , by all accounts , expected to be another banner year for the u.s. wind industry . another year of capacity growth in excess of 5,000 mw appears to be in the offing , and past installation records may again fall . local manufacturing of turbines and components is also anticipated to continue to grow , as announced manufacturing facilities come on line and existing facilities reach capacity and expand . and all of this is likely to occur despite the fact that wind power pricing is projected to continue its upwards climb in the near term , as increases in turbine prices make their way through to wind

power purchasers . supporting continued market expansion , despite unfavorable wind pricing trends , are the rising costs of fossil generation , the mounting possibility of carbon regulation , and the growing chorus of states interested in encouraging wind power through policy measures . if the ptc is not extended , however , 2009 is likely to be a difficult year of industry retrenchment . the drivers noted above should be able to underpin some wind capacity additions even in the absence of the ptc , and some developers may continue to build under the assumption that the ptc will be extended and apply retroactively . nonetheless , most developers are expected to “ wait it out , ” re-starting construction activity only once the fate of the ptc is clear .

appendix : sources of data presented in this report
wind installation trends
data on wind power additions in the united states come from awea . annual wind capital investment estimates derive from multiplying these wind capacity data by weighted-average capital cost data , provided elsewhere in the report . data on non-wind electric capacity additions come primarily from the eia ( for years prior to 2007 ) and ventyx ’ s energy velocity database ( for 2007 ) , except that solar data come from the interstate renewable energy council ( irec ) and berkeley lab . data on the distributed wind segment come primarily from awea and , to a lesser extent , nrel . information on offshore wind development activity in the united states was compiled by nrel . global cumulative ( and 2007 annual ) wind capacity data come from btm consult , but are revised to include the most recent awea data on u.s. wind capacity . historical cumulative and annual worldwide capacity data come from btm consult and the earth policy institute . wind as a percentage of country-specific electricity consumption is based on end-of-2007 wind capacity data and country-specific assumed capacity factors that primarily come from btm consult ’ s world market update 2007. for the united states , the performance data presented in this report are used to estimate wind production . country-specific projected wind generation is then divided by projected electricity consumption in 2008 ( and 2007 ) , based on actual 2005 consumption and a country-specific growth rate assumed to be the same as the rate of growth from 2000 through 2005 ( these data come from the eia ’ s international energy annual ) . the wind project installation map of the united states was created by nrel , based in part on awea ’ s database of wind power projects and in part on data from platts on the location of individual wind power plants . effort was taken to reconcile the awea project database and the platts-provided project locations , though some discrepancies remain . wind as a percentage contribution to statewide electricity generation is based on awea installed capacity data for the end of 2007 and the underlying wind project performance data presented in this report . where necessary , judgment was used to estimate state-specific capacity factors . the resulting state wind generation is then divided by in-state total electricity generation in 2007 , based on eia data . data on wind capacity in various interconnection queues come from a review of publicly available data provided by each iso , rto , or utility . only projects that were active in the queue at the end of 2007 , but that had not yet been built , are included . suspended projects are not included in these listings .

power authorities that provide power to other cooperatives and municipal utilities ( but do not directly serve load themselves ) , this report uses 2006 retail sales from the electric utilities served by those g & t cooperatives and power authorities . in some cases , these individual utilities may be buying additional wind directly from other projects , or may be served by other g & t cooperatives or power authorities that supply wind . in these cases , the penetration percentages shown in the report may be understated . finally , some of the entities shown in table 3 are wholesale power marketing companies that are affiliated with electric utilities . in these cases , estimated wind generation is divided by the retail sales of the power marketing company and any affiliated electric utilities .

turbine manufacturing , turbine size , and project size
turbine manufacturer market share , average turbine size , and average project size are derived from the awea wind project database . information on wind turbine and component manufacturing come from nrel , awea , and berkeley lab , based on a review of press reports , personal communications , and other sources . the listings of manufacturing and supply chain facilities are not intended to be exhaustive . information on wind developer consolidation and financing trends were compiled by berkeley lab . wind project ownership and power purchaser trends are based on a berkeley lab analysis of the awea project database .

wind power prices and wholesale market prices
wind power price data are based on multiple sources , including prices reported in ferc ’ s electronic quarterly reports ( in the case of non-qualifying-facility projects ) , ferc form 1 , avoided cost data filed by utilities ( in the case of some qualifying-facility projects ) , pre-offering research conducted by standard & poor ’ s and other bond rating agencies , and a berkeley lab collection of power purchase agreements . wholesale power price data were compiled by berkeley lab from ferc ’ s 2006 state of the markets report and 2004 state of the markets report , as well as from ventyx ’ s energy velocity database of wholesale power prices ( which itself derives data from the intercontinentalexchange—ice—and the various isos ) . rec price data were compiled by berkeley lab based on a review of evolution markets ’ monthly rec market tracking reports .

installed project and turbine costs
berkeley lab used a variety of public and some private sources of data to compile capital cost data for a large number of u.s. wind power projects . data sources range from pre-installation corporate press releases to verified post-construction cost data . specific sources of data include : eia form 412 , ferc form 1 , various securities and exchange commission filings , various filings with state public utilities commissions , windpower monthly magazine , awea ’ s wind energy weekly , doe/epri ’ s turbine verification program , project finance magazine , various analytic case studies , and general web searches for news stories , presentations , or information from project developers . some data points are suppressed in the figures to protect data confidentiality . because the data sources are not equally credible , little emphasis should be placed on individual project-level data ; instead , it is the trends in those underlying data that offer insight . only wind power cost data from the contiguous lower-48 states are included .

wind capacity serving electric utilities
the listing of wind capacity serving specific electric utilities comes from awea ’ s 2008 annual rankings report . to translate this capacity to projected utility-specific annual electricity generation , regionally appropriate wind capacity factors are used . the resulting utility-specific projected wind generation is then divided by the aggregate national retail sales of each utility in 2006 ( based on eia data ) . only utilities with 50 mw or more of wind capacity are included in these calculations . in the case of g & t cooperatives and 30

wind turbine transaction prices were compiled by berkeley lab . sources of transaction price data vary , but most derive from press releases and press reports . in part because wind turbine transactions vary in the services offered , a good deal of intra-year variability in the cost data is apparent .

wind turbine mechanical vibrations : potential environmental threat
author : w. dixie dean ( prof . em . ) bsc , miet , mba , bim , frsa hon . lecturer , european centre for professional ethics

abstract this discussion paper describes a significant but overlooked potential threat to the environment , community/business interests and land itself posed by wind turbine mechanical vibrations . their power and frequencies have been measured , and in ireland magnified similar vibrations caused significant harm . given the nature of this problem the author is calling on relevant authorities to exercise increased caution when considering turbine installations until urgent threat assessment is completed .

problem outline

1.1 a russian academic looked at the use of wind power in the usa , canada and germany reporting “ . . . wind turbines can cause infrasonic 1 vibrations which may damage flora and fauna at the site ” . no detail is offered . 1.2 apart from that paper impact of onshore wind turbine mechanical vibrations on the natural environment has never been studied , which is surprising since there are clear indications they may be harmful to life and the fundamental structure of peat and other terrain over considerable distances . only 1 per cent of all papers on renewable energy published in the past 15 years considers environmental impacts onshore2 and in the usa ( 1976 ) it was remarked that “ many of the supposed
independent scientists . . . giving unbiased advice to the government to deal with the ( vibrations ) issue have received substantial funding . . . from the major producers of 3 noise pollution ” . little has changed since , and the uk is much the same . 2 . 2 .

1.3 these vibrations derive from complex interaction of mechanical factors associated with machinery including masthead electricity generator ; rotation bearings ; blade adjustment/braking mechanisms ; effects of wind ; moments of force on mast/blades/tower , etc.4

1.3.1 due to complexities of design and functioning plus weather and other local environment variations over time , it may be impossible to predict these vibrations5 or their effect on the natural environment , adding to the potential risk factor . 1.4 many living species are specialised , sensitive and vulnerable to small environmental changes ; need large areas with little background disturbance for relatively small but crucial populations to survive ; and are variously affected by the vibrations and acoustic noise wind farms create . all are fundamental to the universal food chain and turbines are often in sites of special scientific interest where flora and fauna may be nationally and internationally protected .

evidence

2.1 hard evidence this may be a serious issue comes not only from russia but from ireland , where in 2003 vibrations caused by installation work resulted in half a million tonnes of peat slip at derrybrien burying a home and road . sludge run off killed 50,000 fish , affected 50,000 more and caused other major problems.6 ecologists are currently considering if disappearance of wild trout stocks from lough lee is related7 . 2.2 concerned wind farm vibrations might interfere with its work at eskedalemuir the ministry of defence commissioned a microseismic study from keele university which measured them.8 although this work is now to be extended natural environment impact remains excluded . the british energy technology support unit considers basic understanding is low , vibrations are difficult to predict , and they may travel considerable distances . 2.3 natural science academics confirm such vibrations affect the structure of sand , soil and peat all of which will be compacted , some losing fertility . they will impact flora and fauna including invertebrates , fungi , bio-aerosols seen only under magnification , and individual living cells .

2.4 some indicative offshore installation studies exist one of which speculates impact on living organisms may be minimal but “ . . . there 's need to quantify by collecting direct data ” , and suggests modulation mechanisms “ . . . are not fully understood ” . it notes many other uncertainties and gaps in knowledge . a danish paper suggests “ . . .
short-term intense activities during construction are probably of less importance than operation and maintenance noise from the wind farms ” .

2.5 wind farms are installed on upland peat bogs where visible damage may already be observed - for example paul ’ s hill and thurso in scotland - with many more and larger in planning on a variety of terrain . the bogs may collapse as fibres unravel and flow away destroying the flora and fauna in them , adversely affecting birds and mammals , and rot into sludge . subsequent foul run-off would pollute waterways with negative impact on fishing , farming , whisky , mineral/spring water bottling , landowner and other business interests . there would be increased risk of flooding ; loss of long enjoyed local amenity ; and individuals , business and taxpayers would be left to clean up the mess . to date official bodies , wind farm manufacturers , owners , and installers have not agreed to indemnify such injured parties .

specific information terrain : peat ; soil ; sand10-12

3.1.1 wind turbines impact all terrain landscape and functionality , but landscape is excluded from this paper . 3.1.2 sand and soils are compacted leading to reduced air and water permeation , with increasing dryness . canadian researchers found that for the first few minutes high frequency vibrations increase the fertility of soil ; but if vibrations continue there ’ s rapid decline . 3.1.3 peat is an ancient , highly complex material , in many areas a living environment . the macro- and microscopic structure of upland peat bog is comprised of minutely interlocking vegetable fibres supporting dead and living organisms , flora and fauna . this basic structure ranges from more or less decomposed plant remains to a fine amorphic , colloidal mass . living peat is governed by complex hydrology which amongst other factors maintains stability and resistance to shear , slide and collapse .

3.2

invertebrates13 ; fungi 14

several fungi species depend on vibration at a specific time to release ripe propagation spores , notably homobasidiomycetes and lycogala . bioaerosols15

3.3

organic and inorganic particles in and above terrain surface ranging in size from less than one micrometer ( 0.00004 '' ) to one hundred micrometers ( 0.004 '' ) . they react to air currents , moving quickly or slowly depending on the environment , and are impacted by gravity . due to their size air density and currents play a large role in movement . living cells 16

3.4

it has been shown that ultrasonic vibrations deform and move isolated living cells , but we don ’ t know what long term effects these phenomena might have on their development .

conclusion i suggest these threats are sufficiently indicated to demand urgent attention . ignoring them to meet kyoto , e.u . or other environmental targets may be unwise , particularly when many question the de facto value of wind power to the environment on other grounds . furthermore the u.k. is signatory to the kyoto protocol which requires avoiding damage to existing carbon sinks , including peat bog . my concerns may prove uncalled for but the ‘ precautionary principle ’ holds and in a responsible world we would expect an immediate moratorium on all new wind turbine installation until these matters are adequately examined and risks properly assessed - but that may be indigestible .

in which case an alternative approach lies in that many turbines and wind farms are installed on peat bogs and other terrain about which a great deal is known from past ecological surveys . a good start may be to repeat them urgently and establish if changes are found , in what respects , to what degrees , and if further research or other action is indicated . useful supporting vibration data may be found in rail and road studies17 . in the meantime i call for significantly increased caution when considering major new turbine installations . this proposal has been put to natural england , scottish natural heritage , uk/scottish governments and other relevant authorities as well as the british wind energy association of wind turbine manufacturers and key members . to date there has been no substantive response from any of those approached , which some may regard as playing russian roulette with the environment and life itself .

postcript i write as a mycologist recognised by the scottish forestry commission but can not claim to be an authority on these matters . that said my views are academically supported as shown .

personal position statement
wind farms
i am not an environmentalist . i have no connection with any anti-wind farm lobby . my concerns are expressed as a responsible citizen with lifelong love of nature , background mycologist . i am not academic in these matters other than to fully prove my concerns are valid i first took interest in this matter last september , have since researched the issues and now fully support my concerns with appropriate peer reviewed academic literature

risks i see may well prove negligible or acceptable , but right now we don ’ t know and i think it imprudent to peremptorily dismiss them so in the public interest i ask three questions of all responsible : can it be denied ; wind turbine mechanical vibrations may seriously impact on sand , soils and peat compacting , loosening and/or otherwise changing their nature ; reduce fertility ; harm flora and fauna in them ? may collapse peat bogs causing pollution significantly harming community and business interests ? if not ; who will enable research to assess such risks ? if no one ; who will indemnify public , private and community interests against loss , should they be harmed as suggested ?

summary of wind turbine accident data to 31 march 2011

these accident statistics are copyright caithness windfarm information forum 2010. the data may be used or referred to by groups or individuals , provided that the source ( caithness windfarm information forum ) is acknowledged and our url www.caithnesswindfarms.co.uk quoted at the same time . caithness windfarm information forum is not responsible for the accuracy of third party material or references .

the accompanying detailed table includes all documented cases of wind turbine related accidents which could be found and confirmed through press reports or official information releases up to 31 march 2011. cwif believe that this compendium of accident information may be the most comprehensive available anywhere . data in the detailed table is by no means fully comprehensive – cwif believe that it may only be the “ tip of the iceberg ” in terms of numbers of accidents and their frequency . however , the data gives an excellent cross-section of the types of accidents which can and do occur , and their consequences . with few exceptions , before about 1997 only data on fatal accidents has been found . the trend is as expected – as more turbines are built , more accidents occur . numbers of recorded accidents reflect this , with an average of 16 accidents per year from 1995-99 inclusive ; 48 accidents per year from 2000-04 inclusive , and 104 accidents per year from 2005-10 inclusive .

year

this general trend upward in accident numbers is predicted to continue to escalate unless hse make some significant changes – in particular to protect the public by declaring a minimum safe distance between new turbine developments and occupied housing and buildings ( around 2km in europe ) , and declaring “ no-go ” areas to the public , following the 500m exclusion zone around operational turbines imposed in france . detailed data is presented chronologically . it can be broken down as follows : number of accidents total number of accidents : 994 by year : year 70s 80s 90-94 95-99 00 01 no . 1 9 17 81 30 17 * to 31 march 2011 only 02 03 04 70 65 59 05 06 07 08 09 10 11* 70 82 121 128 124 97 23

fatal accidents number of fatal accidents : 70 by year : year 70s 80s 90-94 95-99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11* no . 1 8 8 7 3 1 4 4 3 5 4 9 5 5 3 * to 31 march 2011 only please note : there are more fatalities than accidents as some accidents have caused multiple fatalities . of the 78 fatalities : • • 55 were wind industry and direct support workers ( maintenance/engineers , etc ) , or small turbine owner /operators . 23 were public fatalities , including workers not directly dependent on the wind industry ( e.g . transport workers ) .

human injury 79 accidents regarding human injury are documented . by year : year 70s 80s 90-94 95-99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11* no . 2 3 4 1 2 2 2 6 10 14 15 7 9 2 * to 31 march 2011 only 66 accidents involved wind industry or construction/maintenance workers , and a further 14 involved members of the public or workers not directly dependent on the wind industry ( e.g . fire fighters , transport workers ) . five of these injuries to members of the public were in the uk .

blade failure by far the biggest number of incidents found was due to blade failure . “ blade failure ” can arise from a number of possible sources , and results in either whole blades or pieces of blade being thrown from the turbine . a total of 203 separate incidences were found : by year : year 70s 80s 90-94 95-99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11* no . 3 32 4 6 15 13 15 12 16 22 20 25 18 2 * to 31 march 2011 only pieces of blade are documented as travelling up to 1300 meters . in germany , blade pieces have gone through the roofs and walls of nearby buildings . this is why cwif believe that there should be a minimum distance of at least 2km between turbines and occupied housing , in order to adequately address public safety and other issues including noise and shadow flicker . fire fire is the second most common accident cause in incidents found . fire can arise from a number of sources – and some turbine types seem more prone to fire than others . a total of 158 fire incidents were found : by year : year 70s 80s 90-94 95-99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11* no . 1 5 3 2 24 17 15 14 12 21 17 16 9 2 * to 31 march 2011 only the biggest problem with turbine fires is that , because of the turbine height , the fire brigade can do little but watch it burn itself out . while this may be acceptable in reasonably still conditions , in a storm it means burning debris being scattered over a wide area , with obvious consequences . in dry weather there is obviously a wider-area fire risk , especially for those constructed in or close to forest areas and/or close to housing . two fire accidents have badly burned wind industry workers .

structural failure from the data obtained , this is the third most common accident cause , with 112 instances found . “ structural failure ” is assumed to be major component failure under conditions which components should be designed to withstand . this mainly concerns storm damage to turbines and tower collapse . however , poor quality control , lack of maintenance and component failure can also be responsible . by year : year 70s 80s 90-94 95-99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11* no . 1 1 13 9 3 9 7 4 7 9 13 9 16 8 3 * to 31 march 2011 only while structural failure is far more damaging ( and more expensive ) than blade failure , the accident consequences and risks to human health are most likely lower , as risks are confined to within a relatively short distance from the turbine . however , as smaller turbines are now being placed on and around buildings including schools , the accident frequency is expected to rise .

ice throw 31 incidences of ice throw were found . some are multiple incidents . these are listed here unless they have caused human injury , in which case they are included under “ human injury ” above . by year : year 70s 80s 90-94 95-99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11* no . 9 2 2 4 4 3 3 4 * to 31 march 2011 only ice throw has been reported to 140m . some canadian turbine sites have warning signs posted asking people to stay at least 305m from turbines during icy conditions . these are indeed only a very small fraction of actual incidences – a report* published in 2003 reported 880 icing events between 1990 and 2003 in germany alone . 33 % of these were in the lowlands and on the coastline .
* ( “ a statistical evaluation of icing failures in germany ’ s ‘ 250 mw wind ’ programme – update 2003 , m durstwitz , boreas vi 9-11 april 2003 pyhätunturi , finland . )

additionally one report listed for 2005 includes 94 separate incidences of ice throw and two reports from 2006 include a further 27 such incidences .

transport there have been 70 reported accidents – including a 45m turbine section ramming through a house while being transported , a transporter knocking a utility pole through a restaurant , and a turbine section falling off in a tunnel . transport fatalities and human injuries are included separately . most accidents involve turbine sections falling from transporters , though turbine sections have also been lost at sea , along with a £50m barge . by year : year 70s 80s 90-94 95-99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11* no . 4 3 6 6 19 10 11 9 2 * to 31 march 2011 only

environmental damage ( including bird deaths ) 86 cases of environmental damage have been reported – the majority since 2007. this is perhaps due to a change in legislation or new reporting requirement . all involved damage to the site itself , or reported damage to or death of wildlife . 34 instances reported here include confirmed deaths of protected species of bird . deaths , however , are known to be far higher . at the altamont pass windfarm alone , 2400 protected golden eagles have been killed in 20 years , and about 10,000 protected raptors ( dr smallwood , 2004 ) . in germany , 32 protected white tailed eagles were found dead , killed by wind turbines ( brandenburg state records ) . in australia , 22 critically endangered tasmanian eagles were killed by a single windfarm ( woolnorth ) . further detailed information can be found at : www.iberica2000.org/es/articulo.asp ? id=3071 and at : www.iberica2000.org/es/articulo.asp ? id=1875 by year : year 70s 80s 90-94 95-99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11* no . 1 1 1 7 1 6 5 10 21 13 17 3 * to 31 march 2011 only

other ( miscellaneous ) 185 miscellaneous accidents are also present in the data . component failure has been reported here if there has been no consequential structural damage . also included are lack of maintenance , electrical failure ( not led to fire or electrocution ) and planning “ accidents ” where towers have been installed closer than permitted to housing , etc . construction and construction support accidents are also included , also lightning strikes when a strike has not resulted in blade damage or fire . a separate 1996 report** quotes 393 reports of lightning strikes from 1992 to 1995 in germany alone , 124 of those direct to the turbine , the rest are to electrical distribution network .

executive summary over the last two decades the demand for renewable energy has increased and in response the wind energy industry has grown by more than 30 % annually . recently , offshore wind power has emerged as a `` new frontier '' in wind energy , with more than 20,000 megawatts of new generating capacity planned for the waters off northern europe alone.1 by the end of 2007 , some projections suggest that the offshore renewable energy market may be worth as much as $ 12 billion.2 however , economic benefits are not the only reason for developing an offshore wind farm . if a 120 turbine wind farm with a maximum generation capacity of 480 mw were constructed off the coast of south carolina it could provide enough energy to power more than 600,000 homes.3 it would also prevent more than 1 million tons of greenhouse gases from being released into the air each year by conventional coal fired plants . with the u.s. census bureau estimating that the combined population of fl , ga , sc and nc will increase by over 18 million by 2030 , off-shore wind energy can help south carolina and other southeastern coastal states meet a growing demand for electricity in a clean and sustainable way while providing significant economic development to both the coastal and inland regions of the state . wind energy would allow for energy production for regional consumers without greenhouse gas emission or consumption of exhaustible energy sources . based on this analysis , there would be a number of beneficial economic and fiscal impacts to the state of south carolina resulting from the manufacture , installation and operation of a 480 mw find farm ( 120 four megawatt wind turbine generators ) off the coast of south carolina . manufacturing and installation impacts over two-year period during the two-year construction phase the equivalent of up to 1,881 fulltime jobs will be created by direct , indirect and induced effects . annual state economic output is predicted to increase by as much as $ 287 million , and annual disposable income is expected to increase by up to $ 93 million in the state . the fiscal effects resulting from the construction of an off-shore wind farm is predicted to be an increase in state income tax revenues of up to $ 2.8 million and an additional $ 190,000 in corporate income tax revenues over the two year period . operation phase impacts during the operational phase of the project which begins in year three , predicted economic and fiscal impacts will result from the employment of workers to operate and maintain the power generation equipment , as well as from revenue generated by tourism of the off-shore wind farm . the analysis predicts that employment will permanently increase by the equivalent of up to 155 fulltime jobs over the currently predicted baseline . annual state output is expected to increase by up to $ 15 million and disposable income by up to $ 7 million per year above baseline . predicted fiscal impacts are an increase in state personal income tax revenues of up to $ 200,000 and corporate income tax revenues of up to $ 14,000 in each year . in addition , state could potential provide a revenue neutral production tax credit of up to $ .84 cents per mwh .

purpose of study wind is an inexhaustible source of power . it allows for the production of electricity without the use of expensive and environmental damaging fossil fuels . it generates electricity without the emission of greenhouse gasses and it can create vast economic opportunities in not only local communities but state wide as well . the purpose of this analysis is to estimate the economic and fiscal impacts that would accrue to south carolina during the manufacturing and installation phase and the operational phase of a 480 mw find farm ( 120 four megawatt wind turbine generators ) off the coast of south carolina . the wind farm could be constructed far enough off shore thereby preventing interference with coastal vistas . the further away from land the wind farm is placed , the better wind resources will be . south carolina ’ s off shore region carries the advantage of relatively shallow water for some distance from shore . according to the university of delaware graduate college of marine studies , mounts for wind turbines can be constructed in waters as deep as 20 to 30 meters . charts indicate that water depth off of the south carolina coast is less than 18 meters within twenty miles of shore.4 this provides ample space to take advantage of stronger winds further off shore than would be available to many atlantic coast states . employment developing south carolina ’ s off-shore wind energy potential will create jobs in component manufacturing , turbine installation , facility operation and maintenance , and in a variety of other areas which indirectly support these activities . manufacturing requires skilled laborers who design and build the towers , rotor blades , generators , hubs , substation interconnects , and assorted electronic controls which make up a wind turbine power generating platform . installation typically involves local construction firms that will help boost local economies . the operation and maintenance needs of a wind farm will create several permanent and high-quality local jobs . manufacturing a majority of work involved in the construction of an off-shore wind farm goes into manufacturing the components , which include rotor blades , structural towers , hubs , gearboxes , generators , pylons and electronic controls , of an off-shore wind turbine generator . at this time , most of the manufacturing of specialized components will happen out-of-state , at least in the near term . many of the world ’ s major turbine manufacturers are based in europe , and the u.s.-based industry is mostly in california . however , general electric does have a presence within the state and is capable of developing and manufacturing off-shore wind turbine generators . the construction of a large offshore wind farm off the coast of south carolina could help attract renewable energy manufacturers into the state . the creation of a southeast wind energy market could bring additional manufacturing capability to the state and to the southeast in general . for example , in montana some current contracts for wind energy include offers to open wind-turbine manufacturing facilities in the state.5 denmarkbased wind turbine manufacturer vestas considered establishing its american headquarters just outside of boulder , colorado . vestas originally cited colorado ’ s central location to the midwest renewable

energy market as the major reason for consideration and encouraged the state to further develop and market its renewable energy resources.6 according to vestas , the facility would have employed at least 600 workers ; however the firm eventually decided to locate its facility in portland , oregon . although vestas officials did not provide any justification for their decision , some possibilities could be portland ’ s access to port facilities , the economic incentive package offered by the city of portland , support by state and local officials for the federal wind energy production tax credit , interest in wind development by local utilities , and because several large wind energy projects are currently being planned along the border between washington and oregon.7 in greenville , south carolina , general electric ’ s plant has 80 employees engaged in the manufacturing of wind turbine generators . these jobs were created in 2005 after ge ran out of space at its wind turbine plant in pensacola , florida . in 2005 , ge also shifted its turbine business headquarters to greenville from schenectady , new york . since then it has added 200 engineering jobs , bringing the total design and testing work force to around 1,000.8 based on these facts , three models were created , each based on different assumptions as to the amount of in-state manufacturing of the various components that make up a wind turbine generator . model i assumes that 10 % or $ 50 million will be spent within the state to manufacture some components for the wind turbines . model ii assumes that 30 % or $ 150 million will be spent in the state to manufacture several components of the wind turbine generator and that the assembly of the generators will occur within the state of south carolina . however , model iii assumes that 100 % or $ 500 million will be spent within the state to manufacture and assemble the wind turbine generators . if south carolina and other southern states were to provide economic incentives in the form of tax credits and subsidies for renewable energy development , there is always the possibility that renewable energy manufactures would locate more of their facilities in the southeast . installation it is estimated that an off-shore wind farm requires up to 75 workers on site during construction . these workers assemble turbines , erect towers , construct pylons , and lay cable . the estimated time for construction for this project is 24 months . for land based wind farms , the electric power research institute estimates that every megawatt of wind energy capacity installed creates 0.5 year-long local installation jobs.9 however , their estimates assume a 12 month installation phase and it includes workers used to construct roads and other structures that would not be needed for an off-shore wind farm . operation and maintenance off-shore wind farms require a well trained staff to operate and routinely service the turbines throughout their 30-year lifetimes . these needs create long-term , full-time employment close to the port facility that would service the wind farm . the electric power research institute estimates that every 6.9 mw of capacity requires one full-time employee to operate , monitor , and service a land

based wind farm.10 since this analysis is based on a 480 mw off-shore wind farm , using the estimates from the electric power research institute would equate to 70 new jobs . the cape wind project being developed off of cape cod , massachusetts estimated that it would require 50 fulltime employees to operate and maintain that off-shore wind farm.11 since there is some variation in the estimated number of employees required to operate and maintain the off-shore wind farm , we ran three models with model i assuming 50 , model ii assuming 65 and model iii assuming 75 jobs for operation and maintenance . tourism the construction and operation of an off-shore wind farm will probably not increase overall tourism in the state , however individual tourist sectors should benefit . several reports have shown that wind farms across the globe have received significant interest from tourists . from manitoba , canada to palm springs , california , where 12,000 tourists visit each year , wind farms have seen the number of visitors requesting tours climb . a study done by mori found that nearly 80 % of those visiting argyil , scotland would be interested in visiting the local wind farm if tours were offered . in denmark , one study found that tourism in areas near wind farms had increased by 25 % after completion of the projects.12 although much of the debate has focused on presumed negative impacts of wind farms to tourism , there is evidence that positive impacts to the tourist industry are possible . the model assumes that after construction is completed 5,000 tourists would visit the off-shore wind farm annually . the cost of the tourist activity was limited to the expected increase in demand for sightseeing by way of motorized water transportation . all other impacts to the coastal tourism industry would be negligible since we are assuming that the primary reason for visiting coastal south carolina would not be the off-shore wind farm . it was assumed that the average cost of a sightseeing trip to the wind farm would be $ 100 per visitor or $ 500,000 annually . indirect employment the economic impact of building power plants extends well beyond the direct jobs created in building and installing the equipment . each dollar invested creates impacts that ripple outwards throughout the local economy . for example , workers at a manufacturing plant need raw materials and equipment . their work in assembling turbines supports jobs in equipment manufacturing and component supply . contractors at a construction site need concrete and heavy equipment , and their work supports additional jobs supplying these needs . in addition , all of these new workers require housing , food and other necessities that will be purchased locally . model in order to provide a more accurate picture of the potential impact of an off-shore wind farm to the state of south carolina , three models were developed . model i was developed to show the bottom range of the potential economic impact to the state . this model assumes that a vast majority of the individual components that make up a wind turbine generator would be built outside of the united states . model ii was developed to show the midrange economic impact to the state where

collaboration occurs between an overseas manufacturer and a manufacturer located within the state of south carolina . however , model iii was developed to show the potential economic impact when the wind turbine generators where entirely manufactured and assembled in the state of south carolina . another possible scenario is that since the state of south carolina only has control of the first three miles of ocean floor , it might be more feasible to build a shallow water wind farm using 240 , 1.8 megawatt wtg ’ s rather than 120 , 4 megawatt wtg ’ s . this would exempt developers from seeking approval from federal agencies . another benefit to a shallow wind farm would be that the general electric facility in greenville already produces 1.8 megawatt turbines and would only have to expand and modify its production capacity rather than completely retool its facility or build a new one . since twice the number of 1.8 megawatt wtg ’ s would be required to produce a comparable amount of energy , model iii assumes the same total cost of construction as the other models since per unit construction cost would be less in shallow water . the chart below shows the input values used in the model .

background in 2004 , a comprehensive review of off-shore wind farm costs found that the average cost per mw was roughly $ 2.3 million.13 therefore , based on costs estimates from 2004 , a 480 mw wind farm is estimated to cost $ 1.1 billion . however , since the cost of wind energy has been steadily declining , the total cost of the project used for the purpose of this study way $ 700 million . estimates suggest that the manufacturing and installation phase would take 24 months to complete . both the installation phase and the maintenance and parts operations will be conducted out of a support facility located near

a port in south carolina . based on other studies , we estimated that 3 maintenance teams would operate on a daily basis , with each team comprised of 9 maintenance personnel and 2 crew members . with the other various operational jobs that would be required , there would be a total of 50 full time employees.14 economic impacts during manufacturing and installation the direct economic impacts to the state of south carolina during the manufacturing and installation phase would consist of the hiring of workers and the purchase of non-labor goods and services . at this point it is difficult to determine exactly how many of the specialized components of the wind turbine generators would be purchased outside of the state . other non-labor goods and services such as concrete , steel , and marine services more then likely would be purchased within the state of south carolina . the temporary increase in economic activity within the state during the manufacturing and installation phase would be the sum of : • • • direct economic impacts – hiring of workers and purchases of non-labor goods and services indirect effects – the additional demands for inputs from the industries that sell nonlabor goods and services directly to the project induced effects – the increases in employment , income , and demand for other goods and services that would be generated by the expenditure of disposable income of the newly hired workers

the size of the temporary increase in economic activity in the state during the manufacturing and installation phase and during the operations phase would depend upon the proportion of direct expenditures that take place within the state . once installation of the off-shore wind farm ends and the operations phase begins , the associated direct , indirect and induced economic effects would be permanent changes to the economy of south carolina . there will be two types of activities during the 24-month manufacture and installation phase : • manufacture of the blades and other wind turbine generator components in south carolina before being transported to the project site . studies have shown that a vast majority , nearly 80 % , of the labor inputs required during the manufacturing and installation phase will be needed for manufacturing of the wind turbine generators . installation of the wind turbine generators at the project site includes the installation of the undersea monopile foundations that will support the wind turbine generators ; the onsite assembly of the wind turbine generators ; the construction of the electric service platform ; and installation of the offshore and onshore components of the transmission line that transport the electric power to the region ’ s existing electric transmission and distribution system . about 20 % of the labor inputs required during the manufacture and installation phase will be needed for installation activities .

global insight . “ economic impact analysis of the cape wind off-shore renewable energy project , ” april 2 , 2003. the study that global insight performed for cap wind associates is similar to the one conducted in this report . the total cost of the 130 turbine wind farm located off the coast of cap cod was estimated to be $ 700 million .

to estimate the temporary increase in economic activity during the manufacturing and installation phase , we used the redyn input/output ( i/o ) model for south carolina . this model was chosen because it enables the direct expenditures for labor and non-labor inputs to be allocated into specific economic sectors ( naics codes ) . the appropriate final demand naics code sectors were identified for the purchases of the non-labor goods and services . the redyn model produces multipliers for the total statewide increases in employment , output and income . the i/o model was used to determine the appropriate multiplier impacts at the state level . the following impact assessment addresses both the manufacturing activities conducted onshore and the installation activities that will occur offshore during the first two ( 2 ) years of the project : • between 944 and 1,773 full-time jobs would be created in sc , with the range of the increase varying based on the value of non-labor purchases of goods and services made within sc . total annual output in sc will increase by between $ 114 million and $ 287 million . total annual disposable income will increase by between $ 42 million and $ 93 million . on a per-capita basis , disposable income will increase by approximately $ 10 to $ 21 per year.15 this gain in income will generate an annual increase in sc personal income tax revenues of between $ 1.4 million and $ 2.8 million . annual corporate income taxes would increase by between $ 8,000 and $ 14,000 . however , general government revenue during the manufacturing and installation phase could range between $ 10.3 million and $ 20.9 million .

maintenance employees , local tourism should also experience a positive economic impact . the combination of the direct , indirect and induced effects as described above would generate the following permanent increases to the economy of south carolina : • annual permanent increases , starting after completion of installation , of between 98 and 148 jobs , between $ 8.5 million and $ 13 million in output , and between $ 4 million and $ 6.1 million in labor income . the annual increase in south carolina personal income tax revenues would be between $ 120,000 and $ 181,000 , while the rise in corporate income tax revenues would be between $ 8,000 and $ 13,000 .

as the chart above demonstrates , in all three models the operation and tourism phase has a significantly larger fiscal impact then the manufacturing and installation phase . only in model iii is the output during the manufacturing and installation phase greater than the output from the operation and tourism phase of the project . given the estimated minimum that the state would receive in the form of state income tax and state sales tax revenue , spending at least $ 17.9 million to encourage the development of an off-shore wind farm would not be unjustifiable . however , if the majority of the wind turbine generators were built within the state of south carolina , estimates suggests that state expenditures could increase to a minimum of $ 31.9 million . based on this data , the state of south carolina could offer a production tax credit of up to $ .84 cents per mwh . however , revenue neutrality does not take into account the health and environmental benefits gained by the construction of an offshore wind farm , therefore a larger production tax credit should be considered . the chart below shows the total potential federal and state tax credit that could be offered to a developer to construct an offshore wind farm .

wind turbines and health

w

ind power has been gaining prominence as a viable sustainable alternative to other forms of energy production . studies have found that there is increasing population demand for ‘ green ’ energy1,2 . in australia , this has been encouraged by the introduction of the renewable energy ( electricity ) act in 2000 and the renewable energy target scheme in 2009. as with any new technology , wind turbines are not without controversy . those who oppose the development of wind farms contend that wind turbines can adversely impact the health of individuals living in close proximity .

do wind turbines impact on health ?
concerns regarding the adverse health impacts of wind turbines focus on infrasound noise , electromagnetic interference , shadow flicker and blade glint produced by wind turbines . while a range of effects such as annoyance , anxiety , hearing loss , and interference with sleep , speech and learning have been reported anecdotally , there is no published scientific evidence to support adverse effects of wind turbines on health . reported health concerns primarily relate to infrasound ( sound that is generally inaudible to the human ear ) generated by wind turbines . the world health organization states that ‘ there is no reliable evidence that sounds below the hearing threshold produce physiological or psychological effects ’ 3 . a recent expert panel review in north america found no evidence that audible or subaudible sounds emitted by wind turbines have any direct adverse physiological effect4 . the principal human response to perceived infrasound is annoyance5 . a study of three uk wind farms also supports this conclusion , finding that sound associated with modern wind turbines is not a source which will result in noise levels which may be injurious to the health of a wind farm neighbour6 . however , there is also the argument that if people are worried about their health they may become anxious , causing stress related illnesses which are genuine health effects arising from their worry , but not from the wind turbine itself . for this reason , nhmrc recommends that people who believe they are experiencing any health problems should consult their gp promptly . the situation is further complicated by findings that people who benefit economically from wind turbines were less likely to report annoyance , despite exposure to similar sound levels as people who were not economically benefiting2 .

there is currently no published scientific evidence to positively link wind turbines with adverse health effects .

do wind turbines impact on health ? how much sound do wind turbines produce ? are there other features of wind turbines that may have effects on health ?

wind turbines and health public statement
how much sound do wind turbines produce ?
sound is composed of frequency expressed as hertz ( hz ) and pressure level expressed as decibels ( db ) . human sensitivity to sound is variable and people will exhibit variable levels of tolerance to different frequencies , including those below the normal range of human hearing7 . noise can be defined as any undesirable or unwanted sound . the perception of the noise is influenced by the attitude of the hearer towards the sound source7 . a recent study found that noise annoyance was strongly associated with a negative attitude to the visual impact of wind turbines on the landscape2 . table 1 compares the noise produced by a ten turbine wind farm compared to noise levels from some selected activities .
table 1 : noise levels compared to a ten turbine wind farm
activity jet aircraft at 250m noise in a busy office car travelling at 64kph at 100m wind farm ( 10 turbines ) at 350m quiet bedroom background noise in rural area at night sound pressure level ( dba* ) 105 60 55 35–45 35 20–40

are there other features of wind turbines that may have effects on health ?
it has been suggested that phenomena such as shadow flicker and blade glint could have effects on health . shadow flicker describes the flicking on and off of the wind turbine ’ s shadow as the blades rotate1 . the primary concern with shadow flicker is the potential to cause epileptic seizures . the evidence on shadow flicker does not support a health concern1 . blade glint happens when the surface of wind turbine blades reflects the sun ’ s light11 . all major wind turbine blade manufacturers coat their blades with a low reflectivity treatment which prevents reflective glint from the surface of the blade . the risk of blade glint from modern wind turbines is considered to be very low11 . there has been some concern about electromagnetic radiation from wind turbines however the closeness of the electrical cables counters the electromagnetic field , as does shielding with metal armour12 . concerns regarding the adverse health impacts of wind turbines focus on infrasound , electromagnetic radiation , shadow flicker and blade glint produced by wind turbines , as discussed above . while there is currently no evidence linking these phenomena with adverse health effects , the evidence is limited . therefore it is recommended that relevant authorities take a precautionary approach and continue to monitor research outcomes . complying with standards relating to wind turbine design , manufacture , and site evaluation will minimise any potential impacts of wind turbines on surrounding areas13 .

based on these figures noise levels from wind turbines have been assessed as “ negligible ” , that is , they appear to be no different to that found in other everyday situations9 . further , a survey of all known published results of infrasound from wind turbines found that wind turbines of contemporary design , where rotor blades are in front of the tower , produce very low levels of infrasound10 .

* the “ a ” represents a weighting of measured sound to mimic that discernable by the human ear , which does not perceive sound at low and high frequencies to be as loud as mid range frequencies8 .

the whole goal of this project is to help farmer bob find a wind turbine , so that he can generate his own electricity . there are many different areas of this problem that were covered . farmer bob needs a certain wind turbine that would best suite his needs . farmer bob also needs a way of storing enough energy to create at least two days worth of electricity . another thing that farmer bob wanted was to see if it was possible to run his cars , trucks , or other machinery using energy from the wind turbine . to start out research on what was needed , the electrical use of average homes in the area was needed to see how much energy was going to be used in two days . one possibility that was looked at is to either use a wind turbine that does not produce the needed amount of electricity for every month , but does create excess electricity for a few months . another possibility is to just use a wind turbine that creates excess electricity all year round through research on the internet , it was found that for two days farmer bob would need 82 kwh of electricity . to get 82 kwh of electricity in two days , the storage device would need to be able to produce 1.71 kw of electricity every hour . these were our only constraints . the ideas the team came up with that would store enough energy for two days were a water tower , flywheel , batteries , and hydrogen . while looking at each one of these storage possibilities there were factors such as costs , size , reliability , and safety that would aid in determining which storage device would be used by farmer bob . when looking at the separate devices that would store the energy needed , there were seven areas of importance that were looked at while doing research . each area was weighted according to importance so that when all seven of the areas percentages were added up , they equaled one-hundred percent . see table 1 . 1 .1 table 1 . 1 .1 design criteria for each major area of importance areas of importance percentage initial construction cost : 25 % reliability : 20 % functionality : 15 % maintenance cost : 15 % ease of maintenance : 10 % safety : 10 % size : 5 % we will go into the data for each area of importance later in the main sections of energy storage . batteries batteries were the first storage device thought of , but the idea was quickly discarded . batteries would be much less efficient than any other storage idea . the batteries would also have to be replaced much more often . the initial price to purchase the batteries wouldn ’ t be quite as expensive as some of the other ideas , but because they would need to be replaced often the price would increase quickly , especially during the cold months . this is because batteries tend to drain their energy much faster during the cold months . water tower through research and calculations many advantages of the water tower were found . one of the advantages was that the water tower would use ground water , which is a renewable source . since farmer bob lives on a farm he most likely already has a well to get the water for his tower . another advantage is that once it is up and running it will be very safe and will need little maintenance . also , unless there is a major problem with the water tower , there will be a low maintenance cost . plus , since there are so many water towers all over the united states , it would be easy to find someone to build it . there were also some disadvantages that came with using a water tower . the main problem with using a tower for creating the energy for the two days is that it would be extremely expensive . they found that the water tower that would be used would cost nearly $ 1,000,000 . another disadvantage is that it would be extraordinarily large . but , this is not too much of a problem because it will be located on a farm , which has a large amount of space . a big disadvantage of using a tower is that it would have no functionality . the water tower couldn ’ t help run a car or truck , the only thing it could do is produce electricity for the house . flywheel the team that did research on the flywheel decided to use steel to make it . this is because steel is fairly heavy , easy to find , and cheap to use . the reason the flywheel would need to be made of a heavy material like steel is to cut down on the overall size of it . the flywheel is a very simple design , so it wouldn ’ t be that hard to find a company to build it . the flywheel , as long as enclosed , would be quite safe because there aren ’ t too many small hi-tech parts to the flywheel , but the sheer weight of flywheel could cause it to be dangerous . depending on what breaks on it , the cost of maintenance could be very low , but if something such as the flywheel itself breaks than the cost of maintenance would be very expensive . also , there would be low maintenance because flywheels are typically long-life machines that don ’ t break down easily . some disadvantages of using a flywheel are that it would have to be extremely large to produce the needed electricity . not only would it take up a large amount of space , but it would also be very heavy . this flywheel being used would have no functionality either . it would be too big to fit into a car or some other vehicle that farmer bob would have . depending on what breaks on it , the maintenance cost could be high . also , depending on what breaks , the flywheels weight would cause a big problem in the ease of maintenance . lastly the cost of the flywheel would be about the same as the water tower . hydrogen while doing research on hydrogen many advantages were found . one of the advantages was the initial cost of getting and setting up the hydrogen machines because it would be cheap compared to the water tower and the flywheel . depending on the quality of the machine that farmer bob bought , the maintenance of the machine could be easy . this is because some machines tell you exactly what and where the problem is , the only thing is that a machine like this costs much more than the simple machines that don ’ t tell you were all the problems are . the size of using hydrogen was a big advantage also . the machines that we would use are about the same size as regular household washing machine . as long as the hydrogen was in solid form , it would be pretty safe to use . also , hydrogen has a good functionality . it could be used to help run farmer bob ’ s trucks , cars , or any other machines . although there were many advantages of hydrogen , there were also some disadvantages , but not many . the main disadvantage would be getting the hydrogen . another problem that may occur , depending on what kind of hydrogen machine is used , is that finding the problem , if one does occur , could prove to be difficult . if farmer bob buys a cheap machine he will have to have an expert come in and look at it , which will not be easy because there are not many experts on hydrogen in this region of the u.s.. when assigned the percentages to each area of importance for the water tower , flywheel , and hydrogen there was big difference between the numbers . the flywheel received 450 points , the water tower received 620 points , and the hydrogen received 685 points . hydrogen is going to be used as our storage device due to the fact that it received a greater number of points . section 2 : wind turbine research when we first got this problem there was only guarantee in it . that was that we had to use a wind turbine to harness the power of the wind . therefore , we needed to become familiar with the system of the turbine . meaning that we needed to learn the different parts of the wind turbine , and how they converted the wind into a form of energy capable of being stored . we first started by looking up the basic system of the wind turbine . this consisted of the wind blowing and then turning the blades of the wind turbine . the turning of the blades then creates mechanical energy which can be stored in various forms . this is the basics to the system that we will be using . figure 2.1 within this diagram you can see the many parts to the wind turbine . the rotor blades are what turn from the force of the wind blowing on them . these rotor blades then turn the gears within the gearbox . then the gearing of the system powers a generator which is able to convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy and send it through to the grid connection . from the grid connection is where you would then pull your power from . within the rotor hub that the rotor blades are attached to there are mechanisms that control the things such as pitch and controlling the speed at which the blades spin . wind turbines tend to have brakes in them that stop them from turning when wind speeds get too high for the wind turbine to be able to stay together as it spins . within the hub is a pitch mechanism that controls the angle at which the blades are tilted . next there is the yaw system which controls the turning of the turbine to catch optimum wind for the most energy possible . by catching the optimum wind we will increase our chance of gaining the most power possible through the generator and then storing it in some sort of storage system . this system works to gather the most power capable of the wind turbine and generator . then this energy is stored for usage in houses and on equipment . this setup allows for the turbine to turn the with the wind and change orientation so that it is always capable of catching the wind at an optimum level . section 3 : storage research after looking into wind towers and turbines , research was done to find ways to take and store its electricity . three main areas were chosen to be researched further . these included how to store energy from the wind using kinetic energy , gravitational energy and chemical energy . three different groups were formed to research the solutions and when finding details about each solution , the groups presented their results . the kinetic energy group decided on a solution that would involve a flywheel to store the energy . the gravitational energy group found a solution that involved the storage of energy using a water tower . finally , the chemical energy group decided to use hydrogen as storage for the energy made by the wind turbine . section 3.1 : flywheel the next step of the process was to research whether kinetic energy could be stored and whether it was a feasible solution to the problem . kinetic energy is the energy an object has due to its motion . after investigating the topic , several possibilities for this type of energy storage were found . the most frequently mentioned solution was what is known as a flywheel . because this seemed to have the most information about it , this was the option chosen for the potential storage system . the flywheel has been around for a very long time ; they were especially popular before batteries were generally used and are still used today . some places they can be found are in potters ' wheels , gears of clocks , and in automobiles . the flywheel is some type of wheel or disk attached to a shaft that is spinning . as the shaft spins , the wheel spins as well , storing kinetic energy over time . this stored energy can then be transferred as kinetic energy still or converted into some other form of energy . in the problem at hand , the kinetic energy would be converted into electric energy and could then be used in the farmer 's house and for his other figure 3.1.1 : a flywheel in a race car . electric needs . figure 3.1.2 : nasa flywheel energy requirements after learning what a flywheel was and how it worked , the next step was to design one for the problem . the first calculation needed was how much energy the flywheel needed to store . since wind is unpredictable , it was decided to look for a solution that would hold two days worth of energy . this number was figured by taking an estimate a student 's summer electric bill , which was around $ 100 . this made the price of energy for two days to be around $ 7 . after looking at information from the lincoln power company , the price per kilowatt-hour was said to be $ 0.051 . with all of this information , it was determined that the flywheel had to hold joules of energy . design with this known , possibilities for the actual flywheel could be determined . the factors that went into this next step were how big could the flywheel be , how fast could it safely spin , and what materials could feasibly be used in terms of cost and availability . it was decided that steel and aluminum would be the best choices for the project ; therefore , these were the two possibilities researched in more detail . several calculations were made to determine other factors of the flywheel . these included finding equations for the height and mass of the flywheel as well as other values needed to find them . an in-depth list of equations is given in appendix a . two possible designs were researched . one was that of simply a solid disk attached to the shaft . the other was a cylinder with sixty percent of the middle hollowed out . to attach this to the shaft , rods would have to be placed in the middle . for the solutions found , twelve such rods were used for stability and safety . for both possible designs and both materials , several combinations of radius and angular velocity were put into the equation to determine the heights . the radii tested were between one and five meters . the velocity was between five and twenty-five meters per second . by putting these values into a spreadsheet , the height for each combination could be found . also in this spreadsheet , the mass of each solution was found to see which combinations were too heavy or too large to be conceivable , and therefore could not be used . from here , it was decided that the solid structure weighed too much and so the hollowed out version was the one further pursued . figure 3.1.4 : masses of different options also from this same spreadsheet , aluminum was dropped as a possible material . since the material weighed less , the flywheel , which would already have to be very large when built with steel , would have to be even larger . figure 3.1.5 : heights of flywheels with rods at 17.5 rad/s . the y-axis is the natural log value of the height . the next stage was to determine which combination would be the best in terms of a reasonable radius , height , and velocity . the combination that was picked as the best possible was that of a steel flywheel with a radius of 3.5 meters , an angular velocity of 17.5 radians per second , and a height of about 2 meters . since the height was so much smaller than the radius , it was also determined that it would be best for the flywheel to have a vertical axis . legend for figures 6-7 figure 3.1.6 : comparing natural log of heights of the system for each angular velocity . figure 3.1.7 : comparing natural log of mass of the system for each angular velocity . after finding prices on the internet for steel , the price for the flywheel was determined from the price found for bar-reinforcing steel . this price was $ 0.88 per pound2 . the price of the flywheel alone came out to be $ 822,305.10 . installation and custom building was estimated to be this same price , making the total installed flywheel system $ 1.65 million . advantages and disadvantages the advantages to using a flywheel are that it is quite easy to maintain . reliability is very high ; there are no intricate or very delicate parts . along with this , a specialist is not really required if something goes wrong . as long as the flywheel is enclosed in some type of building , it can be considered very safe . however , this system has disadvantages as well . first of all , the sheer size of the flywheel makes it difficult to do much with . whenever it might need to be lifted , cranes must be hired . next , there is the cost . since the cost is estimated at over $ 1.5 million , it is unlikely that this would be the most cost effective system for the farmer . also , even though it would be quite easy to carry electric energy into the house , transferring it to cars and trucks with this system is virtually impossible . final decision the flywheel was then rated to see how well it scored with the criteria . table 3.1 below shows the exact numbers with a 1 through 10 rating , with 10 being the best . the flywheels disadvantages , functionality and size , scored very low . as is shown , reliability and safety are the advantages to using this system . the weights for each of the criteria were applied and the overall score found for the flywheel was 450. table 3 . 1 : scoring the flywheel criteria rating construction cost 4 reliability 6 functionality 2 maintenance cost 5 ease of maintenance 4 safety 7 size 3 since this score was much lower than that of the other two systems , the flywheel was rejected as a possibility for the farmer . this was mainly due to the size and cost of the system . since this solution was not chosen as the best answer to the problem , research on this particular system stopped and was then focused on the system that seemed to provide the best solution . section 3.2 : water tower s introduction to gravitational e nergy energy is everywhere . it is sometimes a challenge to find a way to store energy to be changed later into electrical energy . one option is to store energy as gravitational potential energy . the first idea that came up with f igure 3 . 2 . 1 was to lift a lot of weight in the form of water high enough into the air using a water tower . gravitational e nergy what was used was the idea that if we use the formula for potential energy ( potential energy = mass x gravity x height ) to figure out how much water needs to be how high . the energy works by lifting a mass to a certain high enough to store enough energy to run a home for several days . when a mass falls the stored energy or potential energy is changed into kinetic energy . in order to produce a few hundred kilowatts of energy needed the mass would have to be very large and very heavy . this would result in it being very difficult to lift as well as being fairly dangerous . we came up with the idea of using water . water was available , and easier to work with than a solid weight would be . figure 3.2.1 force and w ater one of the first things that we need to figure out was how much a gallon of water weighs . we found that one gallon of water = 8.33 lbs . the amount of energy due to the force of gravity and mass are able to produce is what we will use to figure 3.2.2 create the energy needed . we used the amount of energy we needed to produce a graph that showed the size of water tower as well as the height difference between the water tower and the place that we collect the energy . in order to produce a tower that is large enough to collect the amount of energy needed the tower would have to be rather large . the amount of force that is created by storing water is increased the higher up the water tower is . so the higher the storage part of the tower is and the further down the water is released the more force it has . the force is what is used to turn generators the greater the force the more energy is produced . it would work like a dam does . figure 3.2.3 types of t owers there are several different types of water towers , a few of which are shown in f igure 3.2 . 4 . some of these towers have the ability to hold the amount of water that we are going to need in order to store the amount of energy that is needed to supply a farm for a short period of time . figure 3.2.4 double ellipsoidal elevate toro sphere ped-cone fluted pillar /composite shape \* mergeformat shape \* mergeformat shape \* mergeformat shape \* mergeformat c ost of the water tower p roject the cost of the tower however would be rather large . depending on the size of the hill that that is used to our advantage around north west iowa the average hill is about 150 feet the tower would still have to be about one million gallons . the cost of building a water tower depends on the size and location . there for unless we know what the site is like we can not have a reasonable estimate of how much it will cost . additional to the cost of the water tower is the cost of the pipe that has to carry the water from the tower to the area where we would gather the energy . a few examples of the cost of building a water tower may give you an example of how much it would cost to build a water tower in the area . in odebolt iowa a water tower with a capacity of 200,000 gallons was built for a cost of $ 350,700 . in wisconsin rapids a 2 million gallon water tower was built for $ 1.7 million . so the size of water tower that we will need in order to store the amount of water needed is going to cost a large amount . in conclusion , in order to store enough energy to sustain a farm in iowa for a short period of about two days is very difficult . it is possible ; however , the installation cost is not efficient . its maintenance is fairly easy . it ’ s very safe to store energy in this manner . it ’ s also a very reliable source of energy storage . not a very practical way to store energy . section 3.3 : basic hydrogen fuel information hydrogen , unlike any other fuel , can be produced continuously from an unlimited source , water . it is the most common element in the universe . the production of hydrogen is simple and can also be produced using a variety of different fuels . through the electrolysis of water , hydrogen can be continuously produced as long as electricity is being supplied for the electrolysis process . therefore the characteristic of having a continuous and unlimited supply of the hydrogen allows it to be a reliable source of fuel . hydrogen safety all fuels are combustible , including hydrogen . but certain characteristics of hydrogen allow it to have many advantages over fossil fuels in terms of safety . being the lightest fuel , hydrogen 's low density and ability to rapidly disperse allows it to escape into the air if a leak occurs . in addition , hydrogen burns upward , producing only water and heat as a byproduct , and burns out faster in comparison to gasoline products . moreover , propane and gasoline have higher densities and slow dispersal rates that increase the risk of an explosion . hydrogen on the other hand has a lower energy density , therefore producing less heat in a fire and posing less of an explosion risk . hydrogen levels need to reach a concentration of 4 % to 17 % in the surrounding atmosphere in order to pose a danger . a concentration of gasoline only has to reach 1 % before it is in danger of ignition . the chart below , table 3 . 3.1 , contains the characteristics of gasoline , methane , and hydrogen relating to ignition and explosion hazards . table 3.3.1 characteristics related to fire hazards of fuels* property gasoline methane hydrogen

also colorless , odorless , tasteless , and nevertheless highly flammable . a mixture of hydrogen with air burns with a pale blue almost invisible flame . these characteristics mark a hydrogen leak as relatively hard to detect . although hydrogen gas is non-toxic it may provoke suffocation by diminishing the concentration of oxygen in the air below life sustaining levels . of course the hydrogen necessary for asphyxiation is well within the flammable range , therefore making fire the primary hazard . the storage of hydrogen can become dangerous . the best way to prevent dangers posed by the storage of hydrogen include adequate ventilation , prevention of the formation of combustible fuel ( oxidant mixtures ) , and removing potential sources of ignition . availability the hydrogen market is rapidly expanding . the advantage of being portable , reliable and available in unlimited amounts has aroused much research and interest . there are several companies that produce hydrogen system products such as storage devices , electrolyzers , and fuel cells . hydrogen systems are becoming even more common today . the company sigen has recently announced a $ 350,000 contract for the installation of 2 wind turbines , electrolyzer , hydrogen storage facilities , and a 5kw fuel cell system at a park in scotland . in addition , much research is still being done to make hydrogen solutions more feasible and cost effective . the hydrogen system the hydrogen system specific to this project took into account three main components : the electrolyzer , storage tanks , and the fuel cell . this report concentrates on these three main components . albeit the main components constitute the bulk of the cost , various purifiers , regulators , converters , and special connections are required to make the system work . for calculations and conversions regarding hydrogen , refer to appendix b . in diagram , figure 3 . 3.1 , the wide spectrum of usage for hydrogen the hydrogen system can be seen . figure 3.3.1 * picture taken from ovonics electrolyzer an electrolyzer is a device that uses a method of electrolysis to convert water ( or other hydrogen containing fuels ) into gaseous hydrogen . there are several ways to generate hydrogen , a few of these include hydrocarbon conversion , ammonia dissociation , methanol reforming , and sponge iron-oxidation . however , these techniques give an emission of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide , while water electrolysis produces only hydrogen and oxygen as an output . the production of hydrogen has always been common and electrolyzers have a broad range of use . such applications for an electrolyzer include : providing o2 for life support ; providing h2 for corrosion control , electric generator cooling and electronic and materials processing , gas chromatograph detectors , metal forming , and welding . there are two main types of electrolyzers : the potassium hydroxide ( koh ) electrolyzer , and the proton exchange membrane ( pem ) electrolyzer . the pem electrolyzer was chosen for this project due to its ability to generate pure hydrogen from water at pressures around 200 psig or higher , therefore eliminating a need for a compressor . the pem electrolyzer is an important component of the hydrogen system . when connected to a water supply and an electrical output it can generate hydrogen gas at a constant pressure . theoretically , electrolyzers split water into hydrogen gas at an electric potential of 1.23 volts . water enters the electrolyzer through a connection port . the hydrogen ions then gather towards the negatively charge cathode while the oxygen molecules gather at the positively charged anode . the hydrogen gas is then transported out of the electrolyzer , while oxygen is emitted into the air . the electrolyzer can be connected directly to a fuel cell to generate electricity , but it is typically connected to a hydrogen storage device . the hydrogen storage device receives the hydrogen output from the electrolyzer and stores the hydrogen gas as a metal hydride , liquid , or gas . figure 3.3.2 h2o ( h2 + o2 + heat *picture taken from greenwinds , www.pege.org/greenwinds/ electrolyzer.htm a typical electrolyzer has 85 % efficiency . moreover , commercial electrolyzers can output hydrogen gas at a pressure of 100 to 500 psig . the range of pressure output is also increasing ; high pressure electrolyzers of 1000 to 4000 psig are becoming available in the market . hydrogen storage hydrogen can be stored in a variety of ways , each of which caries its own specific advantages and disadvantages . hydrogen is relatively non-corrosive , therefore the cost of specially designed materials is reduced . but embrittlement may occur in some metals at elevated temperatures and pressures . below are the different types of hydrogen storage methods that were considered for this project . liquid hydrogen hydrogen is available in a liquid state , but only at extremely cold temperatures . because of the cold temperatures equipment must be specially designed . liquid hydrogen typically has to be stored at 20 kelvin or -253o c. the cooling and compressing process also requires energy , resulting in a loss of about 30 % of the energy that the liquid hydrogen is storing . after hydrogen is produced , the gaseous hydrogen is then compressed , cooled to low cryogenic temperatures by the use of heat exchangers and tube expanders . liquid hydrogen is normally stored in onsite storage systems typically consisting of a tank , vaporizer , and controls . these systems are selected in accordance to usage rate , pressure , and regulations . the tanks are cylindrical in shape and usually placed in a horizontal position . liquid hydrogen tanks are vacuum insulated , with pressure relief valves located on both ends in order to protect the tanks . liquid hydrogen tank capacities can range from 1500 gallons to 25,000 gallons there are safety concerns involved with the liquid storage of hydrogen and the maintenance of the cryogenic tanks . moreover , the ease of use is diminished whilst using liquid hydrogen . extreme care is taken when dealing with the liquid , protective clothing is always worn in order to prevent exposure to the extremely cold liquid and hydrogen vapors . the major disadvantage of liquid hydrogen is cost , and ease of usage . it is rather expensive to manufacture insulated cryogenic tanks for the storage of hydrogen . details of the expenses and specifications concerning the vessels specific to the project are located in section 5.2. figure 3.3.3 *picture taken from a stanford webpage , sts-93 shuttle launch , http : //rescomp.stanford.edu/~stanj/travel/sts-93/ gaseous hydrogen gaseous hydrogen can be stored in several different ways . it may be compressed into gas cylinders by oil lubricated compressors , stored into tube trailers , or stored as a highly compressed gas in storage tanks . cylinders the cylinders are usually tapered to a small opening on the top where a valve or any other suitable outlet connection is located . the cylinder is usually filled in with hydrogen pressures ranging from 1000 psig to 4000 psig . the amount of gas in the cylinder is determined by the pressure , temperature , cylinder size , and cylinder pressure rating . cylinders have the advantage of being mobile , but a major disadvantage is that cylinders of more than 300 scf are quite rare . details of the expenses and specifications concerning the cylinders specific to the project are located in section 5.2. tube trailers stationary tubes or hydril tube modules store large quantities of hydrogen . these tubes are usually tapered on both ends to which connector valves , or safety devices can be attached . they are commonly mounted on a truck trailer chassis . the tube capacities can reach up to 150,000 scf , with an average pressure of 2,640 psig . hydrogen tube trailers are usually a good choice when mobility and immense hydrogen quantities are the major deciding factors . since this is not the case regarding the current project , hydrogen tube trailers are not recommended as a medium of storage . compressed tanks hydrogen can be compressed into high-pressure tanks . this process requires energy to accomplish and the space that the compressed gas occupies is usually very large . a hydrogen gas tank would be more than 3,000 times bigger than the gasoline tank for the same amount of energy stored . compressing the gas is also expensive and must be periodically tested and inspected to ensure safety . these disadvantages proved compressed hydrogen tanks as a poor option for this project . details of the expenses and specifications concerning the tanks specific to the project are located in section 5.2. metal hydride tanks metal hydrides are made of combinations of metallic alloys that act like a sponge soaking up water . the metal hydrides can absorb hydrogen and release it later , either at room temperature or through the heating of the tank . one disadvantage is that the ratio of percentage of gas absorbed to volume of the metal is rather low , but hydrides offer a valuable solution to hydrogen storage . metal hydrides offer the advantages of safely delivering hydrogen at a constant pressure . yet a major disadvantage of metal hydrides includes high costs . details of the expenses and specifications concerning the vessels specific to the project are located in section 5.2. carbon n anotubes carbon nanotubes are microscopic tubes of carbon that store hydrogen in microscopic pores on the tubes and within the tube structures . they are similar to metal hydrides for storing and releasing hydrogen , but the main advantage of carbon nanotubes is the amount of hydrogen they are able to store . although this seems like a good option for the project it was not considered any further because carbon nanotubes are still in the research and development stage . figure 3.3.4 ( a ) hydrogen tube trailer , ( b ) hydrogen gaseous cylinders , and ( c ) compressed hydrogen storage * picture taken from ovonics fuel cell a fuel cell is an electrochemical device that is capable of delivering electrical energy continuously by a reaction of a fuel and an oxidant gas at an efficiency range of 50 % -60 % . a fuel cell resembles a battery , but unlike a battery it does not need continuous replacement or recharging . a fuel cell will continuously produce electricity and heat as long as it is supplied with hydrogen gas . the fuel cell consists of an electrolyte in between two electrodes , called the anode and the cathode . hydrogen from the storage units and oxygen from the air are pumped into the fuel cell . activated by a catalyst , the hydrogen gathers to the anode , while the oxygen ions gather towards cathode . the hydrogen atoms separate into protons and electrons . the electrons pass through an electric circuit creating a flow of electricity . the protons , however , migrate to the cathode through a membrane to reunite with the oxygen molecules to produce water and heat . figure 3.3.5 *picture taken from the nasa electrochemistry website , http : //www.grc.nasa.gov/www/electrochemistry/doc/fuelcell.html there were four primary fuel cell technologies considered for this project : - table 3.3.2 fuel cell phosphoric acid fuel cells proton exchange membrane ( pem ) solid oxide alkaline anode & cathode made of finely dispersed platinum catalyst on carbon paper fluorocarbon ion exchange lanthanum magnate cathode and a nickel-zirconia anode electrolyte silicon carbide matrix polymeric membrane thin layer of zirconium oxide as a solid ceramic electrolyte potassium hydroxide advantages most commercially developed fuel cel l. operates at relatively low temperatures and can vary its output to meet shifting power demands . excellent for small applications . promising for high powered applications , electrical generating stations r egenerative or reversible fuel cel l can produce electricity from oxygen and hydrogen , but can also be reversed to work as an electrolyzer . the pem ( proton exchange membrane ) fuel cell was chosen for this project since it can operate at relatively low temperatures of 80˚c allowing it to warm up quickly and not need expensive containment structures . furthermore only relatively low temperature fuel cells are attractive for the pem electrolyzer . the pem fuel cell is also more versatile in relation to output . for a given volume or weight , the pem generates the most power of any fuel cell . the pem can also be connected to a hydrogen storage tank that stores solid , gaseous , or liquid hydrogen . all these advantages made the pem fuel cell the optimal choice . r ating the hydrogen storage system was rated for each criterion on a scale of zero to ten with ten being the greatest , see figure 3.3.6 . these ratings were then used to compare the hydrogen system to other alternative solutions for storing energy . figure 3.3.6 the hydrogen system was rated by specific criteria agreed upon by the team . section 3.4

total score 450 620 685 rating scale r each solution was rated by the team on scale excellent 9-10 of 0 to 10 for each criterion . the rating was good 7-8 multiplied by the criterion weight and then fair 5-6 summed . the hydrogen solution was chosen poor 3-4 as the optimum . unsatisfactory 0-2 the decision matrix was the method chosen for determining the best solution for storing energy . the matrix shown above , table 3 . 4 , provides a fair comparison of all the alternatives created by the team . the first two columns list the criteria and their particular weights in percent . going across the matrix and evaluating each alternative against a single criterion gives the rating score . multiplying that score with the weight given for each specific criterion obtains each point value , which is then totaled after all criteria is evaluated . the solution with the highest point value , in this case the hydrogen system , is considered the best solution for storing energy . when looking into each criterion it is easy to see why the hydrogen system was chosen as the best possible solution . overall costs for each solution were very high , but when compared to the other alternatives the hydrogen system came out to be the most inexpensive option . the safety of all three solutions was rated similarly because each option was equally as feasible in this criterion . the section that had the biggest impact when it came to the point values was the functionality criterion . the functionality criterion was based on how each solution could use the energy that was being stored . the group wanted to look into the possibility of using the wind turbine and energy storage for not only powering the house with electricity but for other options such as powering the car and farm equipment . the flywheel and water tower were very limited in their capabilities of transporting the energy from one thing to another . their main purpose was just to store the energy , therefore giving their functionality a low score . the hydrogen system was however adequate in meeting all the demands . it could store the energy for later use , transport it to the house for power , and with the technology available it could also be used to power the car , laptop , and even a cell phone . with all these capabilities the hydrogen system was given a ten for functionality as compared to the alternative solutions which both received a two . when evaluating size , the hydrogen system provided a more feasible solution than the alternatives . with the constraints given for the amount of energy that needed to be stored both the water tower and the flywheel would have to be an overpowering size . when looking into the size of a hydrogen storage system , with the same constraints applied , the estimated size would be that of a household washing machine , thus making the hydrogen system a far better option in the size criterion than the flywheel and the water tower . overall , when analyzing the point values of all three of the solutions , the hydrogen system scores the greatest value . when looking closer at each criterion it is easy to understand how the hydrogen system is more proficient in not only storing the energy needed , but also being able to be transported and used for multiple purposes . with more capabilities for use than those of the flywheel and water tower the decision was made to go with a hydrogen storage system to be used with the wind turbine and tower . section 4 : needs assessment section 4.1 : seasonal demands the amount of energy used during each month in an average iowa home was found by looking at an electric bill comparison1 . figure 4 . 1 displays the results that were found . the periods that require the most energy are winter and summer due to heating and air conditioning . july requires the most energy , just less than 1,400 kwh . april is the month with the least energy demands at slightly above 1,100 kwh . the annual demand is 14,800 kwh , an average of about 1,200 kwh per month . figure 4 . 1 : energy used each month seasonal supply the wind supply does not follow this same pattern . instead , it peaks during the spring months and is fairly high during the winter . however , it does drop down drastically during the summer , when the demands are peaking . all wind turbines follow this pattern , no matter what size and height of tower since the production amount varies directly with the supply of wind . by using the iowa energy center online2 , the total production of several systems could be found . this was done by simply comparing the same system at different heights and comparing production . the possible solutions that were explored involved one system creating enough electricity from wind that there would be very little storage . in this system , the supply virtually never goes below the demand . overall , this system produced 25,700 kwh per year , overproducing by 75 % . the next production system dropped slightly below the average during two months . this produced 22,500 kwh per year , an overproduction of 50 % . the final looked-at solution dipped below the average demand during the entire summer . this system produced 17,700 kwh , which still overproduced by 20 % . the annual break-down is given in table 4 . 1 : table 4 . 1 : energy production with different tower

the summer months , the 50 ft. tower lacks 1,300 kwh , and the 100 ft. tower is 500 kwh below demand . the 150 ft. tower is virtually always above the demand and has no deficit . the deficit numbers are the amount of storage the system would need to store during the months of excess to be able to provide energy during the months of under-production . figure 4 . 2 .1 : monthly production compared to monthly demand since all of the systems produce more than is demanded during the year , the next step is to determine whether it would be cheaper to build a bigger wind turbine and tower that produces more energy and requires less storage , or to have a smaller turbine system which requires a much larger storage system . in order to determine the best possible solution , costs of various turbines , towers , and hydrogen storage systems must be researched . figure 4.2.2 below demonstrates how each system 's production compares to the other systems ' and also the actual and average demands . figure 4.2.2 : comparing systems section 5 : cost analysis section 5.1 : cost of turbines within the cost analysis of the wind turbine we have come up with five different combinations of height of wind turbine , size of the turbine , and number of turbines . the prices for everything that we would need for the different turbine combinations have been researched . recommendations for optimal configurations are based on this data and the amount of storage . the 5 combinations are : table 5.1 combination company turbine size ( # of turbines ) tower height ( ft. ) a whisper 3.0 kw ( 2 ) 150 b whisper 4.5 kw ( 2 ) 120 c whisper 4.5 kw ( 3 ) 80 d jacobs 10 kw ( 1 ) 100 e excel 10 kw ( 1 ) 100 combination a : through our research we found that we would need two of them raised to a height of 150 feet when on their towers . these turbines cost $ 6,130 each . this made our pricing for this combination to $ 12,260 without the tower costs . we were not able to find the costs of a 150 foot tower . we did find the pricing of 120 foot towers which was which was $ 9,200 . through simple figuring it is easy to see that a 150 foot tower would have to cost more than a 120 foot tower for the shear fact that the tower is taller . in this scenario we will need to be able to store 463 or more kilowatt hours as to make up for the months that we can not produce enough power from our turbines . combination b : in the second combination we have a 4.5 kilowatt turbine produced by whisper mounted on a 120 foot towers . we will use two of this combination . the turbines cost $ 5,790 each which brings the turbine total to $ 11,580 . then the towers will cost $ 9,200 , therefore , the full cost of the towers will be $ 18,400 . this brings the full cost for this scenario to $ 29,980 . with this scenario we will need to store at least 953 kilowatt hours . combination c : for our third scenario we will need to store 289 kilowatt hours for the months we are not able to produce enough energy . we will be using the same 4.5 kilowatt turbine as in scenario two . in this scenario we will use three turbines put on 80 foot towers . the total cost of the three turbines comes to $ 17,370 . in our research we were able to find 80 foot towers costing $ 870 each . therefore , the total cost of the towers is $ 2,610 . the total cost of this whole scenario comes to $ 19,980 . combinations d & e : in fourth scenario we will be using one jacob ’ s 10 kilowatt turbine set on a tower that is 100 feet tall . the 100 foot tower pricing came out to $ 7,800 . we were not able to find any prices on the jacob ’ s 10 kilowatt turbine . in this scenario we would need to be able to store at least 467 kilowatt hours of energy . if we estimate that this turbine must cost similar to the excel 10 kw turbine then the price would be around $ 20,000 . with that estimation the total would be around $ 27,800 . in the final scenario we will be using an excel 10 kilowatt turbine placed on top of a 100 foot tower . the excel turbine costs $ 19,900 . the tower that we will be using will cost $ 7,800 . this will bring the total for this scenario to $ 27,700 . in this scenario there will have to be storage for 629 kilowatt hours of energy . figure 5.1.1 while looking over all the scenarios it is understandable that you need to take in to account the amount of maintenance that will be done on the turbines . most of the time more turbines would equal more maintenance , but because the one turbine options are larger turbines there is a possibility that they would need more maintenance . therefore , the scenarios that had two or three turbines could have higher maintenance costs than those with only one turbine , but that is not necessarily true just more likely . at the same time those with more turbines continually needed less stored energy . therefore , there would be less storage costs when more than one turbine was used . though , the maintenance costs could be slightly higher in the third scenario ; the low amount of storage needed the amount spent on storage materials would be considerably lower . for that reason we feel that scenario three is the most viable one for our needs . therefore , we will be recommending three 4.5 kilowatt turbines on 80 foot towers to produce the energy needed to run our farm . figure 5.1.2 section 5.2 : cost of wind towers introduction to wind towers wind towers are an easy way to increase the amount of energy produced by a wind generator . in figure 5.2.1 you can see that as height above the ground increases so does the wind speed . the wind tower also allows the farmer to keep the wind generator danger a safe distance away . height and wind energy wind energy increases also depending on the location of the wind turbine and tower . when the wind tower is in a place that is flat there is an increase in energy . also as illustrated in figure 5.2 . 2 you can see that when there are tall objects obstructing the wind the wind speed decreases . so the ideal place for a wind turbine to be placed is in the middle of a field filled with a short crop . this placement will give the user easier access to a slightly higher speed wind source . different types of wind towers one of the big differences in wind towers is the many options . an interesting fact about towers is that there are several different types . the different types of towers are illustrated in figure 5.2.3. the guyed tower is a tower that has wires helping to support the structure . a lattice tower is a tower that uses angle iron and different geometrical shapes to produce a stable tower that supports its self and the wind turbine . there are pole tower lattice tower guyed tower some towers that are just a pole sticking out of the ground ; however , these structures are very weak and unreliable . there is also the possibility of a tower that can tilt up or down there are several methods to achieve this goal as seen in figure 5.2.4. one of the final choices that farmer bob has in choosing a wind tower is the possibility of attaching it to an already standing building . this gives additional height . the drawbacks to this could be the stability of the building , the location of the building , and the availability of a building large and strong enough to support a wind tower and turbine . tilt up towers cost the most likely deciding factor when it comes to our tower is the cost . most wind turbines will fit the different types of towers with little or no modifications . therefore , the type of tower is not a determining factor in the cost of the wind turbine tower . the wind towers cost varies with height and brand , the brand of wind turbine being the most important factor in purchasing a wind tower . this is shown in f igure 5.2.5. the cost according to height is not the determining factor it is the type of tower that is most likely to be the deciding factor . whisper ( guyed tower ) bergey ( tilt

hydride : $ 206,350.00 liquid : $ 4,543,250.00 figure 5.3 capital costs of storage per kwh prices may vary by company and model , the prices listed above are estimated price quotes received for this project . after doing a cost analysis of the hydrogen system for each alternative form of storage it was decided to go with a gas storage tank . this decision was made on the basis of cost mainly with safety , size , and efficiency also being considered . in terms of safety the metal hydrides are the safest of the three solutions with gas and liquid hydrogen being equally rated for safety . these three solutions are almost equivalent in size for storing . for more information about size , safety , and efficiency please refer back to the hydrogen system section of the report . for each solution a fuel cell and an electrolyzer are needed , using the models listed above the cost of the system would be $ 74,250 plus the cost of the storage . when using a gas storage tank with the fuel cell and electrolyzer a total cost of $ 77,632.50 is estimated for 100,000 liters stored . this price estimate is far less than those of the metal hydride or liquid hydrogen storage options , making gas storage the best possible solution . section 5.4 : electrolysis experiment using a small electrolyzer we composed a series of experiments in order to test various aspects of the electrolyzer by varying salt content and voltage . the first set of trials consisted of an electrolyzer connected to a voltmeter and an ac generator . by varying the salt content of the electrolyte in the electrolyzer and keeping the voltage close to constant , we observed the output of hydrogen with each addition of salt content . figure 5.4.1 illustrates the changing efficiency of the electrolyzer as the salt content changes . from this graph we find that the efficiency of the electrolyzer rises as the salt content rises , but the efficiency starts to decreases after a certain maximum point of salt content efficiency . figure 5.4.1 the next set of trials was conducted by varying the voltage , and measuring the hydrogen output . from the results , it was concluded that small voltages produced the greatest efficiencies for the electrolyzer . figure 5.4.2 illustrates the efficiency with varying voltage , while figure 5.4.3 shows the hydrogen output with varying voltage . figure 5.4.2 figure 5.4.3 it was observed that the efficiency of the electrolyzer was also low . this was especially clear once the efficiency of the fuel cell was measured and found to be much higher than that of the electrolyzer . the efficiency of the demonstration fuel cell was found to be at 64 % , which was much higher than the 3.5 % noted from the demonstration electrolyzer . section 6 : conclusion it is feasible for farmer bob to have a wind turbine to generate all his electricity . he has the opportunity to use any wind turbine , but he needs a wind turbine that will produce enough electricity for all his uses every month ; also , he does not need a wind turbine that will generate way too much electricity . it was found that farmer bob would best be suited with one of the five turbine options that was stated in section 5.1. farmer bob would get greatest efficiency out of the wind turbine if he placed it on top of a hill . farmer bob needs a way to save the energy created by the wind turbine for days when there is little or no wind . batteries , a water tower , and a flywheel were all ideas that are not going to be used because they all have too many disadvantages compared to a hydrogen system . see s ection 1 . a hydrogen system is the most feasible system for farmer bob to store the energy that the wind turbine generates . hydrogen cylinders are also the best type of hydrogen saving system that farmer bob could use . compared to the cost , hydrogen cylinders are the safest and most reliable . see p. 27 . when it comes to farmer bob ’ s cars or trucks , he will not feasibly be able to run the vehicles on the energy the wind turbine generates . the use of hydrogen is how the energy is going to be saved . hydrogen has already been proven to power vehicles engines , but at a high cost . for farmer bob the cost of converting his vehicles engines to run on a hydrogen fuel source wouldn ’ t be too expensive , but getting the extra hydrogen to fuel his engine would be expensive . plus , hydrogen powered vehicles do not have the same output as normal gasoline engines . therefore , it would end up costing farmer bob more to run his cars on hydrogen than it would to run his cars and trucks on the current fuel source of gasoline . appendix a variables : k =kinetic energy d =density i =moment of inertia m =mass v =volume r =radius h =height l

wind turbine foundations
windpower : a solid foundation and more
wind turbines , the world ’ s fastest-growing source of renewable energy , are being constructed across america and around the globe . barr has performed engineering work at 35 wind farms in 12 different states , as well as at four sites in canada . most of our work is related to the design of foundations for wind turbines up to 250 feet high , but we ’ ve also provided other services essential to the projects ( see list at left ) . our approach to wind-turbine-foundation design relies on determining site conditions and selecting the option most economically appropriate for the site . working together , our geotechnical and structural engineers conduct a subsurface investigation program , analyze the results , and design a foundation system suited to the site . during the investigation , we use one or more in-situ testing technologies to understand the ground conditions and soil parameters . next , we identify and analyze feasible foundation types . the analysis includes evaluation of bearing capacity , amount of settlement , stress levels , deformation levels , overall stability , ground improvement , and dynamic ground behavior . a foundation type that is reliable and economical is selected , and we pepare specifications and drawings for construction that include details on foundation preparation , equipment , materials , and performance . in 2003 , barr and m.a . mortenson company , a minneapolis construction firm , were granted a u.s. patent for the design of a high-tension , high-compression foundation for tower supports . the design uses a radial array of special high-tension pilings and a concrete cap as a substitute for very large spread footings . it provides a foundation for large wind-turbine towers that may be more economical and easier to install than traditional foundations . to find out more about barr ’ s experience and capabilities in the area of windpower , contact chris kopchynsnki , p.e . , via phone ( 952-832-2911 ) or e-mail ( ckopchynski @ barr.com ) .

a study of a wind farm power system

national wind technology center national renewable energy laboratory golden , colorado abstract a wind power system differs from a conventional power system . in a conventional power plant , the operator can control the plant 's output . the output of a wind farm can not be controlled because the output fluctuates with the wind . in this study , we investigated only the fixed-frequency induction generator , often used with wind turbines . we adopted the worst-case scenario and conducted a per-phase , per-turbine analysis . our analysis showed a strong interaction among the wind farm , the utility grid , and the individual generator . in this paper , we investigate the power-system interaction resulting from power variations at wind farms using steady-state analysis . we use the characteristic of a real windsite on a known weak grid . we present different types of capacitor compensations and use phasor diagrams to illustrate the characteristics of these compensations . the purpose of our study is to provide wind farm developers with some insights on wind farm power systems . key words : wind turbine , power system , wind farm , renewable energy , stability , voltage fluctuation , capacitor compensation , induction generator , reactive power compensation . introduction in the early stages of wind energy development , the number of turbines is small and the locations of the farms are scattered . thus the contribution of power from wind farms to the grid is negligible . as the size of a wind farm gets larger , the contribution of the power from the farm gets larger , and the interaction between wind farm and grid becomes more important to the operator and utility company . many wind turbines use fixed-frequency induction generators . the induction generator is connected directly to the utility line . the power system 's problems related to fixed-frequency wind turbines are more challenging to engineers than the variable-speed wind turbines , because there is minimum control that can be applied to fixed-frequency induction generators . figure 1 shows a cluster of wind turbines connected to a grid . the single-line diagram representing the system is shown on the same figure . the wind turbine is operated using a constant-frequency induction generator . each generator is connected to a distribution transformer at the foundation of the wind turbine . the output from each wind turbine is connected to interconnection point to be called the point of common coupling ( pcc ) . from the pcc , the output is connected to a transmission transformer , raised to a high voltage , and transmitted over the transmission line . at the end of transmission line , it is connected to the rest of a much larger grid ( infinite bus ) . the impedance of the transformers and transmission lines are lumped together and is represented as zs . while conventional power plants use synchronous generators , a wind farm power plant uses induction generators as the main generation . the behavior of the synchronous generator is very well known and has been investigated for more than a hundred years . similarly , the behavior of the induction motor is widely known . although considerable effort has been spent on developing induction motors , induction generators are not commonly used in conventional power plants . in this study , we use the characteristics of the power system for a real wind farm connected to a known weak grid . the lines between the wind farm and the infinite bus may have several connections to feed small towns or loads along the way . we investigate how the voltage behaves at these connections when the wind speed a very large grid

changes . the voltage variation at the pcc not only affects customers connected to the same point ( town a and town b ) , but also affects the entire wind farm . another important aspect of the investigation is the stability of the power system at the wind farm . it is shown in the next few sections that a strong correlation exists between the voltage variations and the stability of the systems . instability can cause the whole wind farm to shut down . many publications have discussed hybrid power systems with diesel generators operating in parallel with wind turbines,1,2,3 however , wind farm power systems were considered less problematic than hybrid systems . unfortunately , not all wind farms are connected to a stiff grid . many areas with excellent wind resources are located in weak grid systems . also , many wind farms increase their output by installing bigger and newer wind turbines . while a dynamic simulation is an important tool in determining the stability of the wind farm power system,4,5,6 the big picture of a wind farm operation can be better understood from the basic characteristics of each component . steady-state analysis is used to explain the behavior of a wind farm power system because it gives a broader spectrum in understanding the system interaction . in the sections that follow , we first describe the components of a wind farm power system , including the wind turbine , induction generator , and parallel representation of wind turbines . next , we discuss the perphase , per-turbine equivalent circuit representing the entire power system , and then present different types of compensation . finally we summarize the paper in the conclusion section . components of a wind farm power system wind turbine the simple aerodynamic model commonly used to represent the turbine is based on power performance versus tip-speed ratio ( cp-tsr ) . the cp-tsr characteristic of the turbine is derived from measured average output power and average wind speed . the aerodynamic power generated by the wind turbine is determined by the density of air , the radius of the blade , the performance coefficient at any instant , and the wind speed . figure 2 shows curves of aerodynamic power output for wind turbines at different rotor speeds . it is assumed that the wind turbine is stall-control operated at a constant frequency . the rotor speeds shown on the legend are the rotor rpm at the high-speed shaft ( at the generator side ) . as can be expected , the peaks of available aerodynamic power increases as the rotor rpm is

figure 2. aerodynamic power versus wind speed for different rotor rpm ( stall control ) fixed at higher speeds . thus , operation at high slip increases the aerodynamic power capability of the wind turbine . once a runaway occurs for a stall-controlled wind turbine , the generator can not regain control of the wind turbine . some type of braking mechanism must be available to control the rotor speed . induction generator figure 3 shows a typical power-speed characteristic of an induction machine as the operating slip varies from slip = 1 ( motoring ) to slip = - 1 ( generating ) . assuming there are no losses in the induction generator , the power shown in figure 3 is the power that must be driven by the wind turbine . normal ( stable ) operating slips usually lie within a very narrow slip range ( around + 2 % , bounded between pm-peak and pg-peak in figure 3 ) . the normal motoring region lies between 98 % and 100 % of synchronous speed , while the normal generat600

ing region lies between synchronous speed and about 102 % of synchronous speed . rated power is usually about 50 % of peak power ( pg-peak ) . the relationship between voltage and current of an induction machine varies as the slip changes from standstill to generating speed ( above synchronous speed ) . at large slip , the stator current is much larger than in normal operating slip . as an example , at startup ( slip = 1 ) , the stator current can reach up to 800 % of the rated current . the magnitude and the phase angle of the stator current affects the voltage drop along the transmission line . parallel representation of wind turbines as shown in figure 1 , a wind farm can be simplified as n parallel turbines . the following assumptions were made to simplify the analysis : • • • the wind turbines are identical . wind speeds at the wind farm are uniform , so that all wind turbines start at the same time . each turbine runs at the same operating condition at all times ; thus , the voltage , current , and power factor of each turbine are identical to the rest .

and the final solution is simplified as : vs = es - zsnew i1 [ 6 ] where : zsnew = n zs . conducting our analysis on a per-turbine , per-phase basis enables us to understand the collective effects of wind turbine power generation in a wind farm environment . as shown by the equations above and in figure 4 , the number of turbines will change the characteristics of individual induction generators when the size of line impedance zsnew grows larger as we add more turbines into the wind farm . for newly constructed wind farms , the grid system is usually computed for possible expansion in the future . in many places , however , a wind farm is connected to an existing grid . although the transmission system in this grid is thermally capable of carrying the generated power , the system grid may be weak ( zs is large ) . per-phase , per-turbine analysis figure 4 shows the per-phase , per-turbine equivalent circuit of an induction machine in a wind farm connected to the utility grid via a transmission line . the utility is represented by the infinite bus es , and the reactance zs represents line impedance and transformer impedance present between the induction machine and the infinite bus . the number of wind turbines on-line determines the loading of the transmissions systems . thus , it affects the voltage at the pcc . the characteristic of each induction generator connected to the same pcc will be affected . the number of wind turbines will appear as if the impedance zs is multiplied by n , where n is the number of turbines operating at the same time . thus , the more turbines are on-line , the weaker the grid appears to be ( larger zsnew ) . figure 5 illustrates the loading effect on a certain transmission line . the impact of varying the slip of the induction generator and the impact of adding more turbines to the same line are shown . the normalized voltage at pcc for different numbers of turbines on-line also is shown . with only 10 wind turbines , it is obvious that the power system grid is stiff and the voltage does not change with slip . in the normal speed range beutility

the impedance of the line feeder between each turbine and the pcc is identical and negligible . in practice , wind farms can be very large , and the locations of individual wind turbines can vary , as do the wind speeds at each wind turbine . the operating conditions of wind turbines can also be different with respect to each other . thus , the assumptions above may lead to a pessimistic result or the worst-case scenario . equations 1 through 6 are derived based on the sign and arrow convention of the voltages and currents shown in figure 4. the variables printed in bold are phasors , and each equation can be expressed or illustrated by a phasor diagram . with only a single turbine operating , the terminal voltage at the pcc of the wind farm can be expressed as : vs = es - zs i1 [ 1 ] if there are n identical turbines operating in parallel , the voltage equation can be expressed as : vs = es - zs ( i1 + i2 + i3 + i4 + i5 + . . . + in ) [ 2 ] with the assumption presented above , the currents in each branch are equal . i1 = i2 = i3 = i4 = i5 = . . . . . = in [ 3 ] the equation can be rewritten as : vs = es - zs ( n i1 ) [ 4 ] or , if analyzed on a per-turbine basis , the equation becomes : vs = es - ( zs n ) i1 [ 5 ]

figure 5. per-phase voltage at pcc versus rotor speed tween 0 % slip ( speed = 1.0 per unit or p.u . ) and 2 % slip ( 1.02 p.u . ) , the voltage variation at pcc is very small ( about 1 % ) . however , when the number of turbines is increased to 200 , the voltage variation becomes larger . for example , for the same operating range , the voltage drops by as much as 15 % . the torque-speed characteristics of all individual wind turbines are identical , and the torque-speed characteristic shrinks as more turbines are connected online . to illustrate the effect of the number of turbines on torque capability , consider the torque-speed characteristic shown in figure 6. the wind farm consists of wind turbines rated at 275 kilowatts each . each wind turbine has an induction machine as the generator . figure 6 shows that , with 10 wind turbines on-line , the torque-speed characteristic for an individual induction generator is barely changed . the resulting torque-speed characteristic of the individual induction generator is degraded dramatically as the number of turbines on-line

figure 7. peak electromagnetic torque and aerodynamic torque comparison is increased to 200. thus , there is a good chance that the aerodynamic power of the wind turbine will overpower the induction generator and the wind turbine will go into a runaway condition if nothing is done to control it . at the same time , the winding of the generator will be overheated and the voltage will collapse due to operation in a high-slip region . this is illustrated in figure 7 , two-dimensional graph used to describe a three-dimensional problem . the vertical axis is used to represent the torque ( electromagnetic torque and aerodynamic torque ) . the righthand side of graph is used to represent the aerodynamic peak torque versus wind speed . it is shown that aerodynamic torque varies with the wind speed ; it reaches its peak at 17 m/s . the left-hand side of the graph is used to represent the electromagnetic torque of the generator versus the wind speed for two different number of wind turbines on-line . it also shows that the peak of electromagnetic torque of the induction generator ( the left-hand-side curve ) shrinks as the number of turbines on-line is increased . by comparing the left-hand-side and the right-hand-side , it is shown that the electromagnetic peak torque drops below the peak of the aerodynamic torque when the number of turbines on-line is above 120. this is the operating point where instability occurs , thus the wind turbine is in a runaway condition . the slip at maximum electromagnetic torque is shown to be about 3 % . the corresponding voltage at this point of instability can be referred to figure 5 , where it is shown that for 120 turbines online , at 3 % slip ( slip at peak torque ) , the voltage drops as much as 14 % to 0.86 per unit . thus in a way , the voltage drop indicates how close the operation of a wind turbine to the run-away condition . if the wind turbines lower voltage limit is set to 90 % or higher , the runaway condition will not happen , because the wind turbine is taken off line before runaway condition occurs .

in the next few sections , the voltage profile at pcc and the stability of the induction generator will be discussed for different types of capacitor compensation . the contribution of each turbine to the total current in the transmission line will also be presented . the stability will be measured against an uncompensated system based on figure 7 , i.e . , comparing the peak electromagnetic torque to the peak aerodynamic torque . in the real wind farm , the worst-case scenario may seldom occur , however , this pessimistic approach is a good measure of how close the operation of the wind farm is to the instability . the phasor diagrams presented are based on rated speed at –2 % slip . parallel compensation parallel compensation is a common practice in wind turbine generation to improve the power factor of each turbine . some wind turbines use more than one value of capacitor at their terminals to compensate reactive power for different wind speed . the advantage of an improved power factor is the reduction in total current , which , in turn , reduces transmission loss and improves voltage regulation . as an illustration , figure 8 shows a per-phase , per-turbine equivalent circuit diagram of a wind turbine power plant compensated with a parallel capacitor at each turbine . note that although the circuit representing an induction machine is simplified as an impedance consisting of rim and xim , the actual calculations are based on a complete equivalent circuit . typically , the current direction assumes the induction machine operates in motoring mode . the total current is is the sum of the wind turbine current im and the capacitor current ic . based on the equivalent circuit diagram shown in figure 8 , the voltage and current equations can be written as : es = vs + n ( rs + j xs ) is [ 7 ] is = iim + ic [ 8 ] the phasor diagram of voltages and currents for parallel compensation are shown in figure 9. in figure 9a , the phasor diagrams of an uncompensated system are infinite parallel compensation bus pcc nrs j nxs is es vs iim

figure 10. parallel compensation with 200 turbines on-line a ) terminal voltage at pcc b ) electromagnetic torque c ) transmission line current ( per turbine ) the reactive power generated by the capacitors in parallel with the induction generator . for a fixed parallel capacitor , the reactive power output of the capacitor is proportional to the square of the voltage across the capacitor . the reactive power required by induction machine varies with the operating slip . thus , with a fixed

parallel capacitor , the voltage correction varies with the slip of the induction generator and the number of turbines on-line . in figure 10a , the voltage at pcc is shown for different sizes of parallel capacitor compensation . as shown in figure 10a , the voltage is shown to improve as the parallel capacitor is increased . at 1600 uf , the voltage profile at pcc lies within 13 % variation . the voltage improvement comes from an improved power factor after the capacitor is installed . in figure 10b , the torque speed characteristic is shown to shift upward due to the available voltage at pcc increases by the additional capacitor . the wind turbine is improved with the installation of a parallel capacitor . as shown in figure 7 , the electromagnetic torque is overpowered by aerodynamic torque at 120 turbines for a system without capacitor compensation . with parallel capacitor compensation , the peak of generator torque is increased significantly . the line current per turbine shows a noticeable reduction at lower rotor speed ( low slip operation ) with parallel capacitor . at 200 turbines on-line , the parallel capacitor must be sized at least to 1600 uf per phase per turbine . this size of compensation enables the wind turbine to operate at pcc voltage within the limit , and the peak of generator torque is above the peak of aerodynamic torque shown in figure 7. to keep the terminal voltage constant , it is necessary to adjust the size of reactive power generated by the capacitor to follow the fluctuation in output power and to compensate for different number of turbines on-line . different sizes of capacitors or a static var compensator ( svc ) can be used where the reactive power can be adjusted continuously at a different slip or power level . ideally , a small-sized capacitor can be used during low wind speed to raise the voltage to an appropriate level , and a larger capacitor can be used at a high wind speed region to raise the voltage and the electromagnetic torque above the peak of aerodynamic torque . however , even with a constant 1600-uf capacitor , the voltage vs is still within reasonable range . in the example above , it is shown that an additional 90 turbines can be installed for the same transmission line ( assuming that the thermal limit and other transmission limit is not reached ) . without parallel compensation , only 120 turbines can be installed . series compensation in series compensation , the series capacitor is installed in series with the transmission line to compensate the transmission line . the size of the capacitor is chosen to compensate for the line impedance , i.e . , to reduce the effective reactance in the line impedance . the voltage across a series capacitor has a 180o phase shift with respect to the voltage drop across the line

tive reactance is 65 % of the line reactance ( xc = 0.65 xs ) . in figure 12c , the capacitor is sized such that the capacitive reactance compensates 25 % of the inductive reactance of the line impedance ( xc = 0.25 xs ) . in this case , the terminal voltage is lower than the infinite bus voltage ( vs < es ) . the terminal voltage at the pcc is shown in figure 13a for series compensation . with series compensation , the number of turbines on-line can be increased up to 300. the voltage is within the 5 % variation for ( xc = 0.5 xs ) . when the size of the series capacitor is adjusted as such , the resulting xc = 0.5 xs . the resulting torque characteristic of the generator is illustrated in figure 13b . it is shown that with xc = 0.5 xs , the electromagnetic torque of the generator can overcome the aerodynamic torque of the wind turbine ( peak at 1875 nm ) as shown in figure 7. without compensation or insufficient compensation , the generator torque can not overcome the aerodynamic torque and the system is in an unstable condition if the number of turbines online is increased to 300. the stator current in each turbine can be illustrated in figure 13c . it is shown that although compensation improves the voltage profile and the torque profile of the generator , there is an increase on the stator current in comparison to the uncompensated system in the same situation ( 300 turbines on-line ) . parallel compensation improves the effective power factor of the wind farm seen from the pcc , thus reducing the transmission line current and the corresponding losses . series compensation reduces the voltage drop across the transmission line , thus improving the electromagnetic torque of the induction generator . the effective power factor of the wind farm is not affected by series compensation . in a parallel compensation , the level of compensation decreases if the voltage across the capacitor decreases . on the other hand , in a series compensation , the level of compensation increases with the increase of the line current . it is necessary to investigate the variation of terminal voltage at different slip and with different number of turbines on-line to determine the range of voltage on the pcc at different conditions . parallel and series combination it is apparent that we can take advantage of both parallel and series compensation of an ac capacitor . in a parallel compensation , the capacitor is used to compensate the individual induction generator . in series compensation , the capacitor is used to compensate the line impedance . in this section , it is assumed that parallel compensation is used to compensate the basic need of reactive power of the induction generator . as shown in equation 13 and figure 15 , each induction generator is compensated by a small parallel capacitor sized to compensate some portion of the reactive power needed by the in-

conclusion in this paper , we assumed the worst-case scenario for a wind farm , i.e . , each wind turbine operates at exactly the same operating point throughout the entire farm . in reality , the wind farm usually covers a large area and the wind speed within the farm is not uniform . thus the actual situation is usually better than the worst-case scenario . based on a per-turbine analysis , we showed the following : - under per-phase , per-turbine conditions , having n turbines on-line has the same effect as having one turbine connected to an infinite bus via n zs line impedance . - as the number of turbine online increases , the available voltage at the point of common coupling is lower , and the torque-speed characteristic of the induction generator shrinks . - we compare voltage profile at pcc , and the torque characteristic and the stator current at each turbine for different types of compensation . - when the number of turbines on-line increases , the available voltage at pcc drops ( due to high loading of the transmission system ) and the torque-speed characteristic of the generator shrinks . as the margin of instability decreases , at one point , the wind turbine aerodynamic torque can overpower the generator torque and the operating slip increases further . at higher slip operation , the aerodynamic torque available increases . if no outside intervention ( pitch control or mechanical brake ) is taken , a runaway condition can occur . - capacitor compensation can help to boost the voltage at the pcc , thus improving the torque-speed capability of an individual induction generator .

ideal parallel compensation requires a variable reactive power as the output power and power factor fluctuates . a static var compensator can be used to provide parallel compensation with fluctuating reactive power needed . series compensation can be used to offset the voltage drop across line impedance xs . the size of the capacitance can be computed given the required compensation . tscs can be considered to provide an adjustable series capacitor compensation . a combination of parallel and series compensation can be used to improve the overall system . with the correct choice of capacitor sizes , fixed capacitors can be used for both series and parallel compensation . we recommend that , during the wind farm design process , the characteristics of the induction generator be considered . the future expansion of the wind farm should also be taken into account .

small-scale wind turbines for sustainable energy supply in urban environments

small-scale wind turbines for sustainable energy supply in urban environments
frank scheurich university of glasgow email : f.scheurich @ aero.gla.ac.uk introduction the world ’ s current means for the production of useful energy are largely unsustainable . the deployment of coal- and gas-fired power plants is associated with the emission of significant quantities of the greenhouse gas carbon-dioxide ( co2 ) . today 's electricity is mainly generated by centralised power stations that require electricity to be transferred , often over a long distance , from the power plant to the end-user . the method of centralised power production with its associated long-distance energy transmission is inefficient and cumbersome . higher efficiency is achieved by the concept of decentralised energy supply in which the urban energy requirement is locally provided by on-site energy production equipment . decentralised power generation based on renewable resources will be one of the most important steps towards the drastic reduction in carbon emissions within cities ( the stationery office , 2007 ) . amongst the renewable energy systems that have been considered to address the compatibility of decentralised electricity generation and sustainability , mertens ( 2006 ) and stankovic , et al . ( 2008 ) , among others , have identified small-scale wind turbines to be devices with high potential for efficient application in the urban environment . in this paper , results from a computational study are presented that show which characteristics in the aerodynamic design of an urban wind turbine are crucial in order to enable an operation of the turbine with minimum noise and minimum vibration – key requirements for the application of wind turbines in the urban environment . wind turbines in urban wind conditions wind turbines can be categorised according to the orientation of the axis of rotation with respect to the wind direction . figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a vertical-axis wind turbine in comparison to a horizontal-axis wind turbine . in contrast to current on- and offshore wind farms where mostly large-scale horizontal-axis wind turbines are deployed , one of the strategies of harvesting wind energy in the urban environment is based on small-scale vertical-axis wind turbines with rotor diameters of only several metres . the application of vertical-axis wind turbines in cities is mainly due to their inherent advantage over horizontal-axis wind turbines in the built environment since vertical-axis wind turbines are , by design , insensitive to the wind direction . horizontal-axis wind turbines , in contrast , have to be rotated into the wind each time the wind direction changes .

the aerodynamics of the urban environment are characterised by frequent changes in wind direction and high turbulence generated by the presence of buildings . although vertical-axis wind turbines are suited to implementation in urban wind conditions , there are still challenges in the aerodynamic design of the turbine that have to be addressed . these challenges include the design of a wind turbine that has maximum aerodynamic efficiency in highly turbulent winds and , at the same time , has minimum environmental impact in terms of noise and vibration . in addition , strategies and technologies have to be developed further to ensure energy supply in the absence of wind . figure 2 shows a state-of-the-art vertical-axis wind turbine and a current example of its integration into the urban architecture .

small-scale wind turbines for sustainable energy supply in urban environments

research methods in the field of aerodynamics there are two main methods employed by academia and industry in the field of wind turbine aerodynamics : either the wind turbine is studied experimentally in a wind tunnel , or the turbine is investigated computationally using methods that belong to the field of so-called computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) . the motion of any fluid can be described by the navier-stokes equations that are derived from the basic physical principles of mass , momentum and energy interchange . in cfd , these equations are solved numerically in order to simulate the aerodynamics of wind turbines . further information about cfd is given by anderson ( 1995 ) , for example . the results from both experimental and computational research contribute to a better understanding of the flow physics and enable the performance of individual turbine configurations to be investigated in detail – a necessity in order to adapt the design of wind turbines to the unique aerodynamic conditions in the urban environment . computational study of the aerodynamics of vertical-axis wind turbines the aerodynamic performances of two vertical-axis wind turbines have been simulated using a computational fluid dynamics method that is called the vorticity transport model ( vtm ) , developed by brown ( 2000 ) . one of the two vertical-axis wind turbines that were investigated possesses straight blades , as shown in figure 3 , whereas the other vertical-axis wind turbine comprises blades that are helically twisted around the rotational axis , as depicted in figure 4. the concept of modern vertical-axis wind turbines was patented in the united states by georges darrieus ( 1931 ) . the patent included turbine configurations with untwisted rotor blades . further research in the last decade has shown , however , that helical blade twist has structural and aerodynamic benefit . vertical-axis wind turbines with untwisted blades suffer from oscillations in the aerodynamic loading that result in vibration and can cause material fatigue . in order to overcome this disadvantage , the blades are twisted helically around the axis of the rotor . indeed , scheurich , et al . ( 2010 ) confirmed in a comparative study that the variation in overall loading on a vertical-axis wind turbine with helically twisted blades is significantly smaller when compared to a vertical-axis wind turbine with untwisted blades .

in the field of wind turbine aerodynamics , the torque coefficient , cq , which is a non-dimensional parameter , is used in order to compare the performance of turbine configurations that differ in design and size . figure 5 shows the numerically-predicted variation of the torque coefficients , within one turbine revolution , for both wind turbines that were investigated . the torque that is output by the wind turbine that comprises helically twisted blades is relatively steady , whereas the torque produced by the wind turbine with straight blades oscillates significantly within one revolution of the turbine . the oscillating torque that is produced by the wind turbine with straight blades , results in significant vibration that is introduced into the tower and foundation of the turbine . in contrast , helical blade twist considerably reduces the oscillations in torque . the variation of the torque coefficient of the turbine with helically twisted blades is , however , not entirely smooth due to the mutual aerodynamic interference between the blades of the rotor . figure 6 , taken from scheurich , et al . ( 2010 ) , shows the complex wake structure that is produced by the wind turbine with helically twisted blades . downstream of the turbine , each blade encounters its own wake , developed in one of the previous revolutions of the turbine , and the wake produced by the other blades . these interactions result in the small fluctuations that are observed in the variation of the torque coefficient , as described above . the computational method that is used to simulate the aerodynamics of an urban wind turbine enables the cyclic loading on the blades of the turbine , and consequently the vibration induced by the turbine to be quantified in detail . based on these results , a follow-up study will be carried out in order to investigate the parameters of blade aerodynamics that are most relevant to achieve a design with maximum efficiency and minimum vibration . conclusion urban wind turbines will contribute significantly to a sustainable energy supply in our cities of the future . wind turbines with vertical axes have been identified to be superior to wind turbines with horizontal axes in the unique urban wind conditions that are characterised by winds of high turbulence and frequent change of wind direction . in this paper , some results from a computational study have been presented that indicate that a vertical-axis wind turbine with helically twisted blades can significantly reduce the environmental impact through noise and vibration when compared to a vertical-axis wind turbine with untwisted blades . high aerodynamic efficiency in urban wind conditions but , at the same time , minimal impact through noise and vibration are important characteristics of a wind turbine that is to be integrated in the urban environment . references

agma/awea 6006-a03—standard for design and speciﬁcation of gearboxes for wind turbines , is a prime example of the development of a consensus application standard to ﬁll the role required . the standard ’ s foreword brieﬂy states the why and who of its development : “ the operation and loading of a wind turbine speed increasing gearbox is unlike most other gear applications . the intent of this standard is to describe the differences . much of the information is based on ﬁeld experience . this standard is a tool whereby wind turbine and gearbox manufacturers can communicate and understand each other ’ s needs in developing a gearbox speciﬁcation for wind turbine applications . the annexes present informative discussion of various issues speciﬁc to wind turbine applications and gear design . a combined committee of agma and awea members representing wind turbine manufacturers , operators , researchers and consultants , as well as gear , bearing and lubricant manufacturers , was responsible for the drafting and development of this standard . ” some could state that a consensus development process results in a standard that is the “ lowest common denominator ” and not necessarily good for advanced development of a highly technical industry . the content of ansi/agma/awea 6006-a03 will be discussed later in this article , but ﬁrst let us take a look at the history of its development . history agma standards development has been predominantly market-driven , ever since the ﬁrst rating standard appeared in 1919 and the ﬁrst gear quality standard was established in the late 1930s . the number of standards progressed steadily and had a surge in the 1960s and 1970s , when much of the technical content for today ’ s gear standards was documented . a “ milestone ” was achieved in the 1980s , when the american national standards institute ( ansi ) approved agma as the accredited national

the finalization of an international gearbox standard should serve to answer existing questions on the part of designers and builders of wind turbines ( courtesy winergy drive systems ) .

developer for gear standards , and as technical advisory group administrator for establishing national positions on international gear standards . another was achieved in 1993 , when agma— through ansi—was approved as the secretariat of technical committee 60 ( tc 60 ) , gears , by the international standards organization ( iso ) . therefore , agma is responsible for the administration of gear-related standards development worldwide . coincidentally , in 1993 an agma/ awea committee ﬁrst met to develop agma 921–a97 : an information sheet on the “ recommended practices for design and speciﬁcation of gearboxes for wind turbine generator systems . ” the needs for the document were recognized by agma members who were working within this newly developing industry . the document was approved by the agma/awea wind turbine gear committee on october 25 , 1996 and by the agma technical division executive committee on october 28 , 1996. through the 1990s and into this century , wind turbine gearbox failures

continued to slow the development of the industry . it was clear that a standard was needed , and the ﬁrst draft of ansi/agma/awea 6006a03—to supersede agma 921–a97— was developed in march , 2000. the standard was approved by the agma membership in october , 2003 and approved as an american national standard on january 9 , 2004. after becoming a national standard , the ansi standard was presented to iso as a draft international standard , using the verbatim “ fast-track procedure . ” in october 2005 , iso 81400-4:2005 ( as ansi/agma/awea 6006-a03 ) was adopted , with approval by the national bodies of both iso and iec . the resulting iso 81400-4 is part of the iec 61400 wind turbine series . some “ turf ” ﬁghting between iso and iec , as to committee responsibility , resulted in the formation of a joint working group ( jwg ) between the iso/tc 60– gears and iec/tc 88–wind turbines technical committees ( see iso vs. iec sidebar ) . agma ’ s and iso/tc60 ’ s operating procedures have developed

iso vs. iec standard development
in july 2003 , an ansi/agma committee meeting was held that completed the american national standard ansi/agma/awea 6006a03 . the committee intended to fasttrack the standard as an iso standard as soon as it was approved ( october 2003 ) by ansi . however , in may 2003 , a new international work item proposal ( nwip ) , citing the agma 6006 document , was balloted on the same topic within the international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) technical committee ( tc ) 88. this nwip was approved by iec/tc 88 in october independent of iso , which is normally responsible for “ gear ” standards . therefore , in the interest of harmony between iso and iec , it was determined that the development of an international wind turbine gearbox standard would be accomplished by a jwg between iso/tc 60 and iec/tc 88. the jwg organizational meeting was held may 27-28 , 2004 , by mutual agreement in geneva , switzerland . there were 45 persons at the meeting representing iso , iec and their central secretariats . the chairman of iec/tc 88 was the convener . discussions of member status and resolutions of issues in the absence of consensus resulted in the recommendation that each country be represented by each of its national bodies ( iso , iec , or both ) that were present in any meeting . other interested persons could attend , but in the absence of consensus a country would have a maximum of two votes in resolving issues . at this meeting , this resulted in 16 ofﬁcial votes from 10 countries represented . it was agreed that the jwg should produce one standard that would have both iso and iec designation numbers . methods of recording decisions and editing were discussed . it was agreed that the standard draft ballot comments should be reviewed by the jwg for resolution . the jwg reviewed a proposed outline of the standard and developed work assignments for the next meeting , which was scheduled for october 2004. because of the need internationally , it was discussed that the ansi/agma/ awea standard should be fasttracked as a ﬁrst edition while the jwg document was being developed . the u.s. delegation was asked to fast-track its document as an iso/iec document as soon as possible , by a vote of 10 approvals , ﬁve disapprovals and one abstention . issues unresolved at the ﬁrst jwg meeting were who would convene the jwg , what organization would be the “ parent committee , ” and which organization would be responsible for maintenance of the publication . the decision on the convener could not be made by consensus of those present at the meeting and a vote was not taken by the ( iec ) chairman . many of the iso delegates present were disappointed that a convener and a “ parent committee ” for the jwg could not be elected . it was assumed that the management boards of iso and iec would solve these issues . it was later resolved that an iec representative would convene the meetings , iso would publish the ﬁrst fast-track document and administrate the development meetings , and the revision of the publication would be by iec . —bill bradley

sidebar ) . agma ’ s and iso/tc60 ’ s operating procedures have developed comprehensive standards from start to ﬁnish in two or three years . the jwg is chaired by iec and has been working on the next revision/replacement since 2004 , which will be issued as iec 61400-4 when ﬁnished . therefore , the timeline for the international wind turbine gearbox standard development : • agma information sheet started in 1993 , completed 10/1996 ; • national standard started 3/2000 , completed 10/2003 ; • iso/iec “ fast-track ” adoption started in 12/2004 and ﬁnished 10/2005 ; • iec replacement ( up-date ) started in 10/2004 and is still working after ﬁve years . at their last meeting , in april 2009 , the jwg developed the ﬁrst full committee draft ( cd ) for initial ballot within iso/tc 60 and iec/tc 88. the question could be asked , “ what has occurred over the past ﬁve years ? ” and , “ why so long ? ” the answer , as it often occurs , is not due to one reason but many interrelated conditions . experience has shown that some of the reasons could be : too much text-related information that is not necessary as requirements of the standard ; delegations coming to meetings unprepared to make consensus decisions ; time spent in meetings to study issues rather than deciding on content ; and operating in a manner that make resolutions difﬁcult ( see sidebar on standards development ) . although its revision has been time consuming , iso 81400-4:2005– wind turbines/part 4 : design and speciﬁcation of gearboxes—as developed by agma/awea—contains many items that collectively form the most comprehensive application gearbox standard in the world . content the committee responsible for ansi/ agma/awea 6006-a03 development was somewhat unique , being made up of wind turbine manufacturers , users , researchers , consultants , gear and bearing manufacturers , plus lubricant

and system suppliers from around the world , who brought many years of experience with this application to the meetings . a wind turbine is one of the—if not the most—demanding applications for a gearbox . it requires a relatively small , compact , high-power-density gear drive and electric generator to transmit ﬂuctuating loads in a very demanding environment of deﬂections , high vibration and temperature extremes . the present standard applies to gearboxes for wind turbines with power capacities ranging from 40kw to 2mw and higher . it applies to all parallelaxis , one-stage epicyclic and combined one-stage epicyclic and parallel-shaft designs . it provides requirements on specifying , designing , manufacturing , operating and monitoring reliable wind turbine gearbox systems . some of the more comprehensive gear application sections include : • how the system loads and environment shall be speciﬁed and gear capacity calculated ; • manufacturing , inspection , testing and documentation requirements ; • advanced gear tooth contact analysis and veriﬁcation ; • extensive information on the application and capacity of rolling element bearing types ; • lubricant and lubrication system requirements . in addition , annexes supply information on wind turbine architecture ; wind turbine load description ; quality assurance ; operation and maintenance ; minimum purchaser and gearbox manufacturer ordering data ; and lubrication selection and condition monitoring . the revised standard at its present stage of development has updated all the sections of the original document , plus some additions and modiﬁcations , as follows : • scope changed to cover drivetrains with a power rating in excess of 500 kw ; • sections on design lifetime and reliability , design process ,

wind turbine load calculations , gearbox components , design veriﬁcation validation , operation , service and maintenance requirements ; • new annex material . it can easily be imagined that the size of this document has increased substantively . at this stage , it is hard to determine exactly what will be retained after the three iso/iec ballot stages are completed , which could take two to three years—or more—if additional changes are incurred . in the meantime , it is believed that the advent of the ansi/ agma/awea standard has improved gear reliability . however , bearings still seem to need additional work . standards making the development and balloting of both iso/iec and agma/ansi standards is a consensus process . however , individual positions may be expressed that can enhance the contents . members of agma develop new—and continue to revise—the many standards and information sheets . they are also responsible for determining the u.s. position on iso standards . agma standards development has relied heavy on the actual experience of gear system performance in related applications , whereas some others are based on theoretical and laboratory research data .

state rep dairyland power invests in minnesota wind farm renewable energy from the new wind farm will power 2,200 homes dairyland power cooperative , our wholesale power supplier , continues to expand its renewable energy program with participation in the g. mcneilus wind farm , located in adams , minn. five turbines at the g. mcneilus wind farm-adams , located outside adams , minn. , will together generate 7.5 megawatts ( mw ) of renewable energy for hawkeye rec and dairyland ’ s 24 other member cooperatives . this is the amount of electricity required by about 2,200 residential homes in the dairyland system . hundreds of residents , county and state officials , as well as representatives from dairyland and g. mcneilus wind energy joined together to celebrate the new source of renewable energy at a site dedication on monday , oct. 27. berg noted , “ dairyland ’ s mission is to ‘ provide competitively priced energy and services to our customers and maximum value to our owners , consistent with the wise use of resources . ’ as part of our cooperative ’ s renewable energy program , this new wind farm exemplifies dairyland ’ s active commitment to that standard . ” this latest project will add to dairyland ’ s existing wind power portfolio , which includes partnership for energy output of a wind turbine farm in chandler , minn. “ dairyland works hard to be ahead of the curve with the amount and variety of renewable energy provided to our members , ” said dairyland director of planning services neil kennebeck . “ as planners , it has been a very exciting year as we continue to bring more of the best ‘ green ’ energy options into our generation mix . this wind farm is located in one of the windiest parts of minnesota , promising a good supply of renewable power for our members . in fact , it is so windy , we actually had trouble erecting the wind turbines during construction . ” in addition to the wind farm , dairyland has recently contracted for several other renewable energy projects— fueled by dairy and swine manure and landfill waste— as part of its proactive approach to providing clean , efficient electricity to its members . g. mcneilus wind farm-adams facts : dairyland power cooperative will purchase the energy output of five turbines on the adams wind farm from g. mcneilus wind energy , dodge center , minn. each wind turbine will produce 1.5 megawatts ( mw ) of electricity for a total of 7.5 mw . 2,200 residential homes can be powered by this renewable energy . each turbine weighs approximately 1,000 tons . the three blades on the turbine each weigh 13,000 lbs . , and are each 115 feet long . the circle created by the three blades is nearly as wide as a football field . the turbine tower is 225 feet tall . the turbine blades and tower are made in north dakota . the generator is made in denmark . [ sidebar ] wind power : the pros and cons although wind energy is the most well-known source of renewable power , the facts regarding wind as a fuel source are frequently not well understood . because wind , as a renewable form of energy , generates emissions-free electricity , the question is asked : why can ’ t all our power come from wind ? simply put , wind is an inconsistent fuel source…and reliability is everything when it comes to your energy needs . as electric consumers , we count on the light coming on when we flick the switch . we count on our computer to operate when we want to send an e-mail . we count on our furnace to heat our home when we are cold and our air conditioning to cool us down when we are hot . even in the windiest regions , the wind does not always blow . during the heat of the summer , when utilities ’ power supplies are seriously taxed by the use of air conditioning , what energy source is the most likely to fail ? wind . the dog days of summer are not associated with steady winds . mother nature is one element human beings can not control . we can not will the wind to blow anymore than we can wish away the rain on our wedding day . providing electricity requires a near-perfect balance of supply and demand . although a valuable part of a utility ’ s fuel supply , wind has trouble with both ends of the supply and demand equation . “ wind turbines are able to run approximately 35 percent of the time over a year . at times , way too much wind will be produced and at times , too little or none at all . this is wind ’ s fundamental problem , ” said dairyland director of planning services neil kennebeck . since electricity can not be stored , other generation resources must instantly back down or ramp up to accommodate the situation . compare that to other renewable energy sources , such as dairy and swine manure or landfill waste . these are reliable , round-the-clock sources of fuel for electric generators . cow and pig manure is abundant in our region ; therefore , concerns about an undependable fuel supply are not relevant to that fuel source . and , despite efforts to expand recycling programs , the human population will always generate landfill waste . both landfill and animal waste can be converted to methane gas for use as a non-stop fuel source . that is good for anyone who uses electricity…which is nearly everyone . in sum , wind energy is an important part of dairyland ’ s power supply . however , it can not be the only source . coal , natural gas and other types of renewables also must be included to maintain a well-rounded , reliable supply of electricity . dairyland power cooperative , la crosse , wisconsin , provides the wholesale electrical requirements and other services for hawkeye rec and 24 other electric distribution cooperatives and 20 municipal utilities . these cooperatives and municipals , in turn , supply the energy needs of more than half a million people . dairyland 's service area encompasses 62 counties in five states ( wisconsin , minnesota , iowa , illinois and michigan ) . [ sidebar ] funds from fifth wind turbine to finance an orphanage in india the wind that is blowing at the g. mcneilus wind farm-adams in southern minnesota will have the power to touch children on the other side of the world . dairyland ’ s participation in the wind farm has one very special element : the funds g. mcneilus wind energy garners from the sale of electricity to dairyland on the fifth wind turbine will be donated to build and support an orphanage for blind children in bobilli , india . within the orphanage will be a school , taking children from kindergarten through junior college . “ we are all gratified that this business arrangement will benefit these children , who currently are in dire circumstances . it is my mission to see that this renewable energy program will also give a renewed chance for a better life for the children , who have been truly on their own in every sense , ” said garwin mcneilus . for more information contact : tom miller or cindy christensen ( 563 ) 547-3801

and wachusett mountain state reservation section 1 : historic background of existing turbines site pmld owned and operated an eight turbine wind farm at our wind farm site since 1984. the current wind farm was constructed as an alternative to pmld purchasing power from seabrook nuclear power plant . the residents of the town of princeton voted in favor of purchasing and developing this 16 acre site as the town ’ s wind farm in january 1984. the existing wind farm consists of ; seven 40 kw enertech and one atlantic orient corporation 50 kw turbine mounted on 100 ’ steel lattice towers . currently five of the turbines are not operational due to lightning damage and age . all of the units are at the end of their useful life and the cost to maintain and repair the existing units is not practical . the small amount of electricity they produce does not justify the high maintenance and repair costs . our current strategy is to run the operational units to failure . the original plan as designed in 1984 recommended approximately 500 kw of capacity on 50 meter ( 164 foot ) towers . pmld did not install the recommended size and quantity of units due to the high cost , and therefore , only 320 kw of capacity was installed on much small towers . this decision resulted in less energy generated than the projected 10 % of the town ’ s requirements . the wind resource at this lower height and the 50 ’ mature tree canopy surrounding our site were also factors contributing to lower than expected amounts of renewable energy for our existing site . the new state-of-the-art turbines we propose to install are based on entirely new wind speed analysis conducted over the past three years . new wind speed data was collected from eight new anemometers mounted at various heights on our site . the proposed tower size is significantly taller than the mature tree canopy surrounding our site . this will result in generating significantly more renewable energy for the town of princeton with the least number of wind turbines on our site . our strategy is to install the least number of units that minimizes the community and environmental impact , while still generating the greatest amount of renewable energy possible for the resident of the town of princeton . in december 1999 , pmld started the public process to look at the various options regarding the future of our wind farm . one of pmld energy strategies is too provide our customers with affordable , long term fix pricing for electricity , from environmentally sound or renewable energy supplies . one of the options discussed included upgrading the existing wind farm with the newest wind turbine technology . the elected board of light commissioners representing the residents of the town of princeton decided that upgrading the existing site would be preferable to establishing a new wind farm site in town . upgrading the existing 20 year site would allow us to take advantage of both the existing infrastructure already in place and the community support for the existing location . in the time since the original equipment was installed , the wind industry has matured significantly . equipment reliability and cost effectiveness have improved significantly . the equipment capacity or size has also increased dramatically leading much larger turbines and towers . there is essentially no manufacturer today that produces a commercial wind turbine in the size or scale of our existing turbines . cost effective wind energy production only occurs by investing in larger capacity systems . new wind turbines are typically sized between 660 kw to 3000 kw and are mounted on 130 ’ to 265 ’ towers . the larger the capacity , the more cost effective a wind farm becomes . also , at higher heights , a given turbine will generate more electricity due to typically higher than average wind speeds . section 2 : project description to upgrade pmld ’ s existing wind farm pmld , through its elected board of light commissions , started considering the various alternatives to operating our existing wind farm at a public meeting held on december 18 , 1999. this meeting and the resulting wind farm research and analysis lead to special town ballot vote in february 2003 by the community to approve upgrading our existing wind farm . the community overwhelmingly supports the upgrade project and as a result of this support , pmld intends to remove the eight existing 40kw wind turbines mounted on 100 ’ towers and replaced them with two new , 1.5mw to 1.6mw wind turbines mounted on 70 meter towers . the new wind turbines will produce approximately 40 % of our town ’ s annual energy requirements in a cost effective manner . 100 % of the electricity will remain in town and pmld does not plan to sell the electricity to other entities . the electricity generated will reduce our town load and therefore reduce the amount of energy pmld purchases through wholesale contracts , ppa ’ s , or at markets rates . the environmental and community impact is relatively small based on the fact that pmld already operates a wind farm on our 16 acre site over the past 20 years . this community owned small scale wind project successfully demonstrates that renewable energy plants can be sited responsibly and sized appropriately within the environment they are meant to protect . this project reaffirms our commitment to renewable energy , reduces our dependency on fossil fueled energy , and reduces our town ’ s energy costs while balancing the environmental and community impact . this relatively small scale project only makes economic sense because pmld is utilizing existing infrastructure at our wind farm site . relocating to another site would require many more wind turbines to offset the additional infrastructure costs associated with a typical wind farm project . any other site in princeton would require significantly more costs related to site acquisition , electrical interconnection , site preparation , wind resource measurement , and most importantly , community acceptance . new sites would ultimately require many more turbines in order to justify the increased infrastructure costs . pmld further believes that installing only two new units minimizes the impact to the environment while still providing a significant amount of renewable energy to the resident/ratepayers of princeton ma . pmld considered the following criteria in order to determine that upgrading our existing site made the most economic and environmental sense . exposure to prevailing wind : the prevailing wind in princeton is from the northwest . sites with multiple turbines must be located perpendicular to the direction of the prevailing wind . potential sites must not be downrange of higher geographical terrain located northwesterly of any potential sites . higher terrain or natural barriers located in the northwest vicinity of potential sites will create wind turbulence which decreases energy production . the existing wind farm has very good exposure to the northwest prevailing winds without any natural terrain features that would cause turbulence . elevation : wind speed increase substantially with higher elevations . higher locations have a greater potential wind resource . higher elevations also help minimize the height of the wind towers . our existing site has an elevation of 1,504 ’ and is one of the highest elevations around not including wachusett mountain ( 2,000 ’ ) and little wachusett ( 1,565 ’ ) , both already owned by the department of conservation and recreation . existing land use : land that is already owned by the town should be considered first . pmld also considered ; proximity to residential neighborhood , setback from public road , whether or not anther site could be purchased or leased , and whether or not the land is owned by another governmental agency . the cost to acquire and develop new land would make this project too expensive and uneconomical . pmld ’ s existing wind farm site already exists and is owned by the town and controlled by pmld ; the natural terrain in the vicinity of the wind farm masks the view from much of the surrounding area ; and most importantly , the residential of the town of princeton voted to acquire this property as a wind farm site back on 1984 , before the surrounding area was acquired by the department of conservation and recreation ( dcr ) . road access : the existing access road along stage coach trail is suitable with minor alterations , to receive the new turbines and construction equipment . the existing access road was formerly a county road to the summit of wachusett mountain but now owned by the department of conservation and recreation ( dcr ) . as an alternative to the existing access road , pmld has a legal right of way ( row ) to the wind farm site that will be developed to the event continue access along stage coach trail is not allowed . this alternative is still economical and would only require the construction of a new 850 ’ by 20 ’ access road to our site . transmission line access : pmld already owns and operates an adequately sized , 3-phase , 13,800v , overhead distribution lines to the existing site . the existing overhead electric line is capable of handling the new electric load without major modifications . significant tree clearance , line construction , and access would be required for other potential sites that are not in the vicinity of existing distribution lines . pmld ’ s existing electric distribution system in not adequate sized in most other locations in the town of princeton . upgrading our existing electrical distribution to another site would require a significant investment by pmld and make most other sites unfeasible . section 3 : summary of options pmld considered there are a number of options pmld considered in upgrading the existing wind farm : invest the minimum amount to keep it running until failure and dismantle it . this would involve minimal investment and eliminate the wind-farm over time . this would reduce princeton ’ s amount of renewable energy . pmld could then decide whether or not to retain control of the site or sell the land and right of way . upgrade the existing wind turbines with small scale ( 50kw – 250kw ) commercial wind turbines . the projected amount of electricity generated would increase between 1-5 % depending on the size and quantity of units . the economics are very poor with no annual savings , negative net present value , and would lead to higher electricity rates . new units in this scale are no longer available from many of the leading wind turbine manufacturers . upgrade the existing wind turbines with intermediate scale ( 500kw – 750kw ) commercial wind turbines . the projected amount of electricity generated would increase between 5-20 % depending on the size and quantity of units . various cost analysis of this option illustrates a negative return on investment for this option . intermediate sized turbines are becoming less attractive because similar sighting issues exist as compared to the large scale turbines . since there is a negative return on investment , pmld decided not to pursue this option . replace the existing turbines and towers with large scale units . this is option is more cost effective and would produce a larger percentage of renewable energy for the town of princeton . the options include turbines mounted on towers from 200 ’ to 265 ’ . wind turbines in this range are sized between 1,000kw to 3,000w . these turbines become more cost effective and generate positive net present value and annual cost savings . additionally , private partners may be willing to participate in financing the project since more energy and attributes are available to trade . section 4 : community support for upgrade project pmld through its elected board of light commissions started researching the wind farm alternatives in a public meeting held on december 18 , 1999. this meeting lead to a the recommended strategy to upgrade the existing wind farm , with fewer but much larger turbines in the 1.5mw range , mounted on 213 ’ – 230 ’ monopole towers . the environmental and community impact is relatively small based on already operating a wind farm on our site for the past 20 years . the resident stakeholders also support this project as demonstrated in our surveys and ballot vote to approve the project as presented by pmld . winter survey results : a total 1,250 survey were mailed to each resident in the town of princeton . 726 surveys were returned which is a 58 % response rate . this response rate is very high for a survey but clearly indicates the level of interest in town for the project . winter 2000 customer survey results : 726 returned surveys out of 1,250 , 58 % response rate 66 % support continued investment in wind farm 78 % support larger more efficient units 68 % want pmld to maintain environmentally sound power supply see attached survey results special town election : a special town ballot vote was held on february 11 , 2003. the elected board of light commissioners requested a ballot vote for the residents of princeton . the results would determine the level of support for this project and the board of light commissioners would honor the wishes of the voting stakeholders . the overwhelming majority of residents voted in favor of the project . approximately 74 % of the voters supported the new wind farm project . this level of support reaffirmed the elected board of light commissioners decision to support and approve the project to install two much larger units at our exiting wind farm site . see attached election ballot question and result support for this project is based on the following ratepayer/stakeholder benefits : provides at least 20 years of renewable energy economically reduce our town ’ s energy costs diversifies the town ’ s sources of electricity and dependency on one bulk supplier increase the amount of renewable energy utilized as a town to 40-50 % reduce dependency on fossil fuels and associated pollution meet the requirements of massachusetts renewable portfolio standard section 5 : public process and key dates december 18 , 1999 first public meeting to discus future of site

wind farm upgrade project section 6 : turbine operation wind turbines are relatively simple systems that generate electricity when wind conditions are between 3 and 4 m/s , the speed at which the turbine blades experience sufficient lift to begin rotating , and 25 to 30 m/s , depending on the manufacturer and model . each wind turbine can be considered a fully self-controlled power unit . a wind turbine consists of the rotating blades fixed around the hub , a main drive shaft , a gearbox assembly , a generator , the control cabinet located inside the base of the tower , the tower , the concrete foundation and a transformer located either at the base of the turbine or pad-mounted adjacent to the tower base . the control of all energy production and ancillary equipment will be through multiple programmable logic controllers ( plc ) , which interface with computers at each turbine . wind turbines are designed to be operated in an automatic mode ; however , turbines may also be manually controlled for specific situations , such as resets following turbine trips and when weather conditions prevent automatic operation . all of the wind turbines will be controlled through a remote scada system location at pmld ’ s operation center . preventative maintenance data and fault conditions will be provided real-time to pmld in order to control operation of the wind turbines . during after-hours , on-call personal are expected to be respond on site within 30 minutes of any conditions that require personal attention . wind farm operators will make regular trips to the site in order to ensure the turbines are in operating conditions at all times , for regular unit maintenance and for overall project surveillance . the wind turbines will undergo semi-annual scheduled maintenance , which can require from one to two days per turbine . the o & m system will be implemented so only one turbine will be required to go off-line at a time for scheduled maintenance . in this manner , maintenance will result in minimal effects on the overall wind farm availability and energy generation . the scheduled maintenance will not require the use of cranes , as the crew can access the equipment from the ladder located in the tower , and can easily be handled by a two-man crew . the project will not require fencing , as most of the equipment will be installed within the towers , which will be large tubular structures , safely secured and impossible to scale . the individual transformers will be the only piece of equipment accessible and these are well secured and safe for the general public . see attachments : neg micon , main specification nm82 wind turbine , 2003 section 7 : project cost estimates typical wind farm projects cost between $ 1,600 and $ 2,000 per kw of turbine capacity . for this project , a 3,000 - 3,300kw wind farm consisting of two turbines will cost between $ 4,800,000 and $ 6,600,000 to construct . actual quotes were solicited and received by the project team . section 8 : federal and state credits and rebates renewable portfolio standard the commonwealth of massachusetts has established a renewable portfolio standard ( rps ) that investor owned power suppliers must meet . investor owned energy providers must provide a certain amount of renewable energy to massachusetts customers . municipal light plants are exempt , but it makes good sense to follow these higher standards . our project produces renewable energy that is consumed at the point of the generation by the town of princeton . it also generates rps certificates that are tradable is a separate non-energy related market similar to pollution credits . the quantity of the certificate that a site can generate is equal to the amount of energy . the value is market based , but initial discussions with potential buyers have placed the value at approximately $ .03 - $ .04 per kwh . renewable energy portfolio incentive municipal light departments are also eligible for a federal rebate called the renewable energy production incentive ( repi ) . this is an annual cash rebate given to any municipal that generates new renewable energy . the program is congressionally approved on an annual basis and has been in effect for the last 10 years . the current rebate is fixed at $ .019 per kwh . section 9 : energy production estimates pmld proposes to install two turbines rated between 3,000-3,300kw mounted on 70 meter towers . this business model is based on the neg 72c 70 meter tower , 72 meter rotor wind turbine . pmld ’ s site plan review and construction permit is based on a maximum tower height of 70 meters . pmld may consider a 1.65mw turbine as an alternative in order to produce more electricity than the proposed 1.5mw turbines . the most important factor in determining whether or no this project is viable , is accurately measuring and quantifying our wind resource at our site . the wind resource at our site has been measured at various heights since july 2000. pmld was also able to use its original wind data collected between 1980 and 1983 and wind data from a nearby municipal airport to verify our site specific wind resource . three separate energy production estimates were prepared for various sized turbines at our site . the preferred turbine at this time is the neg micon nm72c 1,500kw wind turbine mounted on a 70 meter tower . pmld ’ s financial analysis is based on a conservative production estimate of 7,358,000 kwh annually and a capacity factor of 28 % . this is also the smallest production estimate of the various wind turbines considered for this project . pmld may utilize another manufacturer and model once final bids are received . pmld will verify the final energy production estimate once a final bid is received and accepted . it is important to note that our construction permit is based on the installation of 70 meter towers only . pmld can install slightly larger 1.65mw turbines , but they must be installed on 70 meter towers . see attached energy production analysis : university of massachusetts , renewable energy research laboratory , wind turbine report completed november 2002 wind resource evaluation for cei/pmld , allen becker and richard simon , december 11 , 2002 neg micon , production estimate , september 1 , 2003 section 10 : financial analysis pmld is undertaking this upgrade project because of our commitment to renewable energy , to reduce our bulk or wholesale electric costs , and , to maintain stable and cost effective retail electricity rates for our customers throughout princeton . the primary benefit associated with this project is relatively low cost electricity that isn ’ t affected by fluctuating fossil fuel costs . given that we are using wind as the source of energy for this project , our fuel costs are zero and as long as there is wind , pmld will generate a significant portion of its energy requirements from the wind turbines . pmld ’ s wind farm will generate enough energy and capacity to significantly reduce our town ’ s requirements . pmld estimates the wind farm will produce approximately 40 % of the town ’ s energy requirements annually . the wind farm is separately metered within pmld ’ s service territory and there are no transmission or distribution costs associated with this project . the existing infrastructure from our original wind farm is adequate to service the new wind turbines . 100 % of the energy and capacity generated will remain in the town of princeton and will not be sold to other entities . the net difference between our total town load and wind generation is what pmld will have to purchase through ppa ’ s , energy contracts , or market rates . the long term cost forecast for energy is significantly higher than the all in $ /kwh to produce energy from our proposed wind farm project . market and contract rates for electricity are approaching $ 70/mwh to $ 90/mwh delivered to our lmp ( service territory ) . the all in cost to produce electricity through the wind turbines is approximately $ 52/mwh including repayment of the bond principal , o & m , insurance , and extended warranty over the 20 year life of the project . the total project cost of $ 5,750,000 was determined by soliciting quotes from various construction firms and the wind turbine manufactures directly . some of the costs associated with the project were determined using estimated per unit costs . some of the project costs fluctuate widely such as transportation , steel , and euro exchange rates . fluctuations in these costs could impact our final cost once the project is financed . chart 1 itemizes the various cost components of this project . the bulk of the project cost is directly related to the purchase and delivery of wind turbines . the schedule of estimated payments and approximate timeline is also included in chart 1. chart 2 is pmld ’ s financial analysis calculating the annual energy costs savings , net present value ( npv ) , and internal rate of return ( irr ) on the project . the objective of the project is to generate electricity cheaper than what it would otherwise costs pmld to purchase . this project achieves that objective and pmld estimates the project will generate approximately $ 200,000 in annual savings in our energy budget . pmld is confident that its wind farm upgrade project can produce less expensive electricity than purchasing electricity through either ppa ’ s , contracts , or local spot markets for electricity . this difference will reduce our energy costs and result in more stable electric rates for our customers . the net present value ( npv ) of the project is positive and the irr is 5.6 % . the life of the project is 20 years which matches the operational life of new wind turbines . pmld ’ s financial analysis does not include the financial benefits derived from selling our renewable portfolio standards credits ( rps ) and also does not include the financial benefits of receiving the repi credit from the federal government ( see section 8 for more information related to these benefits ) . both of these financial benefits could produce an estimated $ 255,000 and $ 140,000 in additional project revenue per year for rps and repi respectively . the rps estimate of $ 255,000 is based on selling the credits at $ 35/mwh . the repi credit of $ 140,000 is based on the federal government continuing to issue the credit at $ 19/mwh . overall our financial analysis is based on conservative assumptions and estimates . the project cost of $ 5,750,000 financed through creb bonds over the 20 year life of the project will cost pmld approximately $ 287,500 annually in bond repayments . the combined costs related to the project annual bond principal repayment , insurance , maintenance , operations , and warranty is significantly lese than what pmld would have paid for the same amount of energy through long term contracts , ppa ’ s , or spot markets . chart 1 , project cost summary total project cost summary unit cost capital $ $ 5,206,000 o & m + unscheduled maint $ pv 10 $ 425,678 warranty $ pv 10

benefits the environmental benefits can be calculated using various methods . our wind generators can offset or eliminate the need for fossil fueled power plants . carbon dioxide emissions from power plants are the leading cause of greenhouse gases . a similar sized power plant fueled by coal , oil , or natural gas emits approximately thousands of pounds of co2 , nox , and so2 annually . the wind farm contributes to the reduction of this pollution by eliminating our dependency of fossil fueled power plants . since carbon dioxide is absorbed by trees , our wind farm can absorb as much as 2,300 acres of forest . another analogy used , is to equate the energy generated by the wind farm to the amount generated by a barrel of oil . pmld ’ s wind farm can generate the same amount of energy annually as 4,700 barrels of oil . pmld ’ s wind farm will offset emissions ( pollution ) from other regional sources of electricity . if we do not install our wind farm and generate approximately 9,000,000 kwh of renewable energy annually , the same amount of energy generated from oil , coal or natural gas would create the following estimated emissions : princeton ’ s wind farm will offset emissions by : 11.6 million lbs of carbon dioxide 18,000 lbs of nitrogen oxides 50,400 lbs of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide is the primary gas involved in global warming . rising global temperatures are expected to raise the sea level , change precipitation and alter other climate conditions based on 1,293 lbs co2 per mwh generated nitrogen oxides contribute to the formation of smog , acid rain and toxic chemicals by reacting with other compounds in the air . nox emissions also contribute to the deterioration of water quality by increasing nitrogen loading . based on 2.0 lbs nox per mwh generated sulfur dioxide contributes to respiratory illness and aggravates existing heart and lung disease ; damages trees , crops , stone and other materials ; increases acidity in soils , lakes and other bodies of water ; and increases visibility impairment . sulfur dioxides form particulates that can be transported over long distances and deposited far from the point of origin . based on 5.6 lbs so2 per mwh generated data source for emissions calculated : u.s. environmental protection agency , emissions & generation resource integrated database http : //www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/egrid/pdfs/state.pdf section 12 : access road choices our primary choice for access to the site is stage coach trail . site plan review focused on the re-development of stage coach trail . as an alternative , pmld could develop its legal right-of-way in the event continued access along stage coach trail is not possible . department of conservation and recreation ( dcr ) access road : pmld currently utilizes an existing access ( see attached locus map of site in this section ) road called stage coach trail . this 1,700 ’ trail is a discontinued “ county road ” that was used to reach the summit of mount wachusett back in the late 1800 ’ s . this access road is owned and controlled by dcr . pmld has had an informal agreement to utilize the road as an alternative to developing our legal right of way ( alternative access road ) on westminster road since 1984. since the existing access road is already developed , it makes more environmental sense to continue using the existing access road and not develop a second access road to the site along our legal right-of-way . the existing access road needs minor improvement in order to deliver the turbine equipment to the site during the construction phase of this project . the improvements will include grading and compaction of the access road so that the heavy equipment can be delivered . once the project is complete , access to the site will occur 1-2 days per month . during the winter months access will be limited and the access road will not be plowed or utilized by vehicles , except in an emergency . pmld ’ s maintenance personnel will hike up the trail in order to check operations during the winter months . pmld ’ s computer control system ( scada ) will monitor the turbines 24 hours a day and notify pmld staff in the event of a problem with the site . the minor alterations to the existing access road include regarding with pervious gravel material , compacting the gravel , repairing existing drainage facilities , and removing trees along the edge of stage coach trail . all of the minor alterations and repair are necessary in order to deliver the turbine tower , blades , and generator to the site . the entrance into our 16 acre site at the top of the access road also requires modifications during construction . this is necessary for the longer pieces of equipment such as the turbine blades . the blades will be delivered in one piece approximately 131 ’ long . the turning radius is therefore fairly wide . the turning radius requires us to temporarily remove the stone walls along our site boundaries . pmld will temporarily remove approximately 30 ’ of rock wall where stage coach trail makes a left into pmld ’ s property . all of the stones walls will be reconstructed and returned to their original location once construction is complete . a relatively small number of trees will be removed along the side of the access road and at the entrance into pmld ’ s property , in order to facilitate the turning radius and delivery of equipment . pmld will replace the same number and species of trees in any location dem requests in order to mitigate the environmental impact . 10 trees greater than 2 ’ in diameter along row 15 trees between 1 ’ -2 ’ in diameter along row 10 trees between 4 ” – 1 ’ in diameter along row 20 trees less 4 ” in diameter along row at entrance to our 16 acre site after construction , the access road and entrance to our site will be returned to its original condition . access to the site for preventative and corrective maintenance will be managed accordingly : summer access : once per month , primarily using 4x4 pickups and material handling trucks . pmld can schedule these preventative maintenance visits in order to minimize impact to hikers and other users of the trials and reservation . winter access : the access road will not be plowed during the winter . access will be limited to pmld staff walking to the site in order to perform preventive maintenance and safety inspections . pmld ’ s right of way : if dcr does not allow pmld to continue using the existing access road , pmld will utilize its alternative easement access ( see location on attached locus map ) and construct an access road along its legal right of way ( row ) off westminster road . the legal row is approximately 850 ’ long by 40 ’ and is included as an easement over dcr property . pmld would remove a large number of trees along the row ( see table below ) in order to develop a suitable access road to our site . a large number of additional trees would also be removed on pmld ’ s property as well , in order to get from the end of the row to pmld ’ s turbines . 2 public shade trees greater than 2 ’ in diameter at entrance to row 5 trees greater than 2 ’ in diameter along row 26 trees between 1 ’ -2 ’ in diameter along row 40 trees between 4 ” – 1 ’ in diameter along row 75-100 tress less 4 ” in diameter along row the access road would require stripping the tree stumps and loam , cutting a passable grade , filling with suitable rock tailings , and finishing with compactable gravel fill . the cost to complete this work is included in the project budget . distribution line access : pmld installed 224 ’ of overhead electrical distribution line ( see attached locus map for location of existing electrical line ) from westminster road , over dcr property , to the southern corner of our 16 acre site in 1984. the overhead distribution line feeds our existing wind farm and is designed adequately to support the new wind turbines without modification . pmld will request dcr to formalize our existing 20 year agreement with a 224 ’ by 10 ’ aerial easement over dcr property in order to maintain the existing electrical distribution lines to our property . section 13 : location and construction plans for turbines multiple turbines are typically sited in rows perpendicular to the prevailing winds . our site experiences a north-west prevailing wind . in order to prevent turbulence from one turbine to another , the turbines are typically spaced at least three blade diameters apart . in our case , only two units will be installed so spacing is not a serious concern . the turbines will be located entirely on pmld property and no part of the turbine or blades will protrude over our property boundaries . unit 1 will be located in the northeast corner of our property . unit 2 will be located in the southwest corner of the property . the units will be spaced approximately 800 ’ apart . construction plans have been completed and submitted to the town of princeton , building inspector for permitting . pmld received a building permit on november 14 , 2005. see attachments : locus map with turbine coordinates construction plans for proposed turbines section 14 : foundations pmld ’ s proposed wind farm has 0 – 5 feet of soil overburden on bedrock . based on observation during our site inspection , the bedrock is of a high quality favorable for rock anchor foundations . these foundations will , however , require significant drilling and anchoring . as a result we estimate that the overall cost of the foundations will be significantly higher than the more traditional “ inverted t ” or “ p & h cylinder ” foundations used for wind turbine foundations in more homogeneous soils . pmld will use standard engineering practices in the design and construction of the foundations . a typical spread footing foundation for units of this size is approximately 45 ’ x 45 ’ x 7 ’ . most of the spread footing is covered with compacted common fill and only a 14-16 ’ diameter foundation pedestal is visible above finished grade . due to the sloping terrain at our site , some portion of the spread footing foundation will be exposes depending on the slope of the terrain . in cases where the terrain slopes are steep , rip rap retaining walls will be constructed to reduce the amount fill required and minimize erosion . section 15 : land survey , soil borings , and testing an updated site survey was completed for this project . the survey includes pmld ’ s property boundaries , topography , and the proposed locations of the turbines , crane pads , turbine lay down and staging areas , and the electrical infrastructure . in addition to the survey , soil/rock borings and geotechnical analysis will be performed once construction begins . other ground and site work includes ; concrete tests for the foundations and soil conductivity tests for the design of grounding mats . section 16 : electrical design and connection to pmld ’ s distribution facilities our electrical design includes pad-mount transformers , protective relays , fused load-break switches , surge arrestors , pt ’ s , ct ’ s , and hv metering . for our design , we propose ( 2 ) 1500kva oil-filled , fan cooled y-y transformers manufactured by siemens . although larger transformers could be substituted for this project , as always the tradeoff is between efficiency and cost . based on the wind regime at the princeton wind farm , larger and more costly transformers may be warranted upon further economic analysis . the feeder from the first turbine will enter a live-front panel on the second transformer ( turbine closest to pmld ’ s interconnection line ) , in a daisy-chain configuration . a separate section is provided for metering . pmld will supply our own ct ’ s and pt ’ s for hv side metering . we have specified metering with a pulsed output so that power output can be monitored by the utility via a modem connection . approximately 1000 feet separate the two proposed wind turbines . the second turbine is then another 200 feet from pmld ’ s 13.8kv line . pmld specified 350mcm feeder cable for each phase between the turbines . in a separate conduit , an interface cable will be installed to enable each turbine to be tripped off in the event of a ground fault on the turbine side of each transformer . finally , a third conduit will house the fiber optic lines for turbine communication . pmld assumes that straightforward trenching will be possible to a depth of 4-5 ’ . should this not be the case , we assume that any ledge removal will be billed as a change order on a cubic yard basis . in areas where the minimum 36-inch cover is not achievable , pmld may be required to artificially elevating the ground cover above the feeder trenches . metering metering the production of energy will be provided in a separate section of the pad-mount transformer enclosure at the turbine adjacent to pmld ’ s 13.8kv interconnection . the proposed meter will include a pulsed output port so that the utility may dial up and monitor wind farm production remotely . our electrical one-line diagram includes a ground fault trip interlock on the meter ’ s current transformer . with this arrangement , both turbines can be tripped off-line in the event pmld experiences an outage on the utility ’ s side of the meter . interconnection to electrical distribution system interconnection of the wind farm to pmld ’ s electric grid will consist of an existing , 3 phase hendrix bundle 13.8kv overhead feeder . six existing utility poles connect the wind site electrically to pmld ’ s electrical distribution system . underground feeders to each turbine will be installed from the last existing utility pole on pmld ’ s property . pmld will isolate the wind farm from its distribution system with a pole-mounted , fused disconnect with a ground level operating handle . supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) a variety of scada alternatives are available for the proposed princeton wind farm . the small size of this project does not warrant a server-based communication system typically found in large wind farms . pmld has identified scada packages “ windman express scada system ” and “ visupro system ” as potential scada systems for this project . section 17 : crane access , delivery , and installation pads the existing access road at the proposed wind farm will require minimal upgrades . the removal of several trees adjacent to the roadway will be required , and a topcoat of crushed graded gravel may be necessary . during our initial site assessment we noted that the radius of curvature at the entrance to pmld ’ s property is inadequate . consequently , our proposal includes a design for the necessary civil work at this location . this work will require the removal of several trees , the relocation of several stone walls , and re-grading of the area . the stone walls and grading will be reconstructed and returned to its current condition after construction is complete . a 300-ton manitowoc 2250 crane will be required for installation of the turbines . this crane is transported via fifteen tractor-trailer trucks and assembled on-site . in its unassembled form , only a 12-14-foot roadway is required for access of the crane assembly . once constructed , however , this crane will require a 26-foot roadway in order to move from one turbine installation site to the next . once pmld ’ s land is cleared and grubbed , and the existing wind turbines and infrastructure are removed from the site , we anticipate that the crane will be able to be travel between the two turbine locations without requiring full demobilization . the installation layout and construction of staging areas on our 16 acre site is significant . if the rotors are pre-assembled on the ground ( the most desired and economical method ) , almost an acre of space will be required at each turbine site . because the existing topography at both of the proposed turbine sites is irregular , fill material will be required . the slope of the layout area at the turbine sites need to be relatively flat for turbine assembly . additional cut and fill may be necessary at our site . section 18 : turbine shipping and delivery mass-highway must be contacted to coordinate route access and clearance along highways and town roads leading to our site . the turbines are typically shipped on 8-10 semi-trailer sized trucks . the tower is delivered in three pieces , each blade is delivered separately , and the generator , hub , transformers , and associated equipment are delivered on 2-4 trucks . the table below details the sizes and weights of each component . the turbine blades are the most critical piece since they are made out of lightweight fiberglass and are delivered in one piece . tower sections weight length diameter ( base ) diameter ( top ) embedded section 7 tons 8 ’ 14 ’ 14 ’ base 37 tons 58 ’ 14 ’ 14 ’ middle 28 tons 65 ’ 14 ’ 14 ’ top 27 tons 99 ’ 14 ’ 8 ’ weight length width height generator 51 tons 25 ’ 10 ’ 12 ’ weight length diameter blades 7.5 tons 131 ’ 10.5 ’ the turbine blades are shipped individually and are approximately 131 ’ long . minor alterations are necessary along stage coach trail in order to deliver the turbine pieces . these improvements include minor grading and compaction of the access road . the entrance into our 16 acre site at the top of the access road also requires modifications during construction . this is necessary for the long blades to make the wide turning radius from stage coach trail into the site . this turning radius requires pmld to temporarily remove the stone walls along our site boundaries . pmld will temporarily remove approximately 25-30 ’ of rock wall where stage coach trail makes a left into our site . once construction is complete , pmld will reconstruct the stones walls to their original condition . approximately 12-20 trees will be removed in this corner as well in order to facilitate the turning radius and delivery of equipment . pmld will replace the same number and species of trees in any location dem requests in order to minimize the environmental impact . see attachment : neg micon , weight , dimensions & transport guidelines , nm82 , 2003 section 19 : site structures and buildings temporary facilities no new storage facilities will be required at the wind farm site for this project . pmld plans to use the existing storage shed and electrical service at the wind farm during the installation of the new turbines . pmld will decommission and remove the existing transformers and storage shed at the conclusion of the project . meteorological towers pmld replaced the existing 78 ’ and 130 ’ meteorological towers installed in 1982 and 1999 with two new temporary 40m ( 130 ’ ) and 50m ( 165 ’ ) towers . the new meteorological towers will record and verify wind speed , direction , and temperature at 20m , 35m , 40m , and 50m . wind data has been collected in 15 minute increments since 2000. the current wind resource data-logger emails data via cell phone from the site to pmld . pmld may require one 50m meteorological tower to remain for one additional year after construction is complete in order to verify the power production guarantee . existing turbines and towers the existing turbines and towers will be disassembled and lowered to the ground by pmld ’ s developer . pmld will transport and store the old units at its operations building on worcester road . pmld will sell the old towers and wind turbines . section 20 : local , state , and federal permitting pmld successfully completed all of the necessary environmental reviews and permitting requirements for this important community project and was issued a building permit in november 2005. pre-construction studies and activities completed to date include : town of princeton , special town ballot vote in support of project completed february 2003 . majority of residents voted in favor of project . project received 605 of the 818 total votes or 74 % supported the infrastructure improvements to their 20 year old wind farm . expanded environmental notification form ( eenf ) completed and submitted to eoea for mepa review in march 2004. this report covers impacts related to vegetation , cultural resources , recreational use of reservation , air navigation , noise , visual , security , and public safety . mepa review and certificate issued april 23 , 2004. pmld received favorable mepa review from the secretary of the executive office of environmental affairs ( eoea ) . the certificate states “ that the potential environmental impacts identified in the eenf for the project do not warrant further mepa review ” and further states “ the project advances the commonwealth ’ s management goals for protected parklands and furthers a number of commonwealth objectives related to air quality and sustainable development ” . special use permit issued on october 5 , 2005 by dcr to pmld to utilize stage coach trail as access road . historic and cultural resource survey , completed august 2004 alternatives analysis in response to historic and cultural resource survey , completed november 2004 intensive archeological survey , completed september 2005. study found no significant archeological resources and recommends no further studies . massachusetts historic commission ( mhc ) letter dated october 28 , 2005. agrees with intensive archeological survey , completed september 2005. mhc agrees to pal recommendation of no further historic studies . noise study , photo simulation , shadow analysis , and wind data analysis , completed may 2002 by renewable energy research laboratory . determined that wind turbine sounds are generally quite , well masked , and virtually inaudible at greater distances than 200 meters . preliminary acoustic noise impact assessment , completed may 2002 by pb power . the new turbines will generate 40dba at 1800 ’ . 40dba is the noise level of a quiet urban residential neighborhood . wind resource evaluation , completed december 2002 national heritage and endangered species program determination of no rare plants or animals or exemplary natural communities in the area of our site , completed june 2002 faa determination of no hazard to air navigation , completed july 2002 bird risk study , completed september 2002 by dr. paul kerlinger . he concluded that risk associated with repowering is likely to be low and not significant and not a potential threat to avian populations . shadow flicker modeling and results , completed by wind engineers , inc. may 2004. this study was conducted at harrington farm as they are the closest business/resident to the wind farm . there will be no shadow flicker in the summertime . there is shadow flicker in the morning only . shadow flicker will occur for a total of 12-16 hours during the year between the hours of 7:00am and 9:00am . study also includes mollica property and indicates that very similar amounts of shadow flicker may occur . these worst case scenarios are based on the assumption that there are obstructions such as trees obstructing the shadow flicker . both properties are

mutually developed the article 97 legislation that allows dcr to grant an easement over stage coach trail in exchange for a greater amount of land owned and controlled by the pmld and the town of princeton . this legislation was sponsored by senate chandler and representative evangelidis . the bill was favorably reviewed by the joint committee on bonding , capital expenditures , and state assets . the bill was review and released by the senate ways & means committee . the senate voted and passed the bill on february 2 , 2005. the house committee on steering , policy , and schedule will

princeton . issued november 14 , 2005 and based on new zoning by-laws and second site plan review completed september 2005. dte filing for a comprehensive zoning by-law exemption . filed february 2006. section 21 : land use before and after construction the town of princeton , through its light department ( pmld ) , owns and operates the 16 acre wind farm site off westminster road . pmld has complete control and maintenance of the land since it was purchased with electric ratepayer revenues in 1984. the site includes an 850 ’ x 40 ’ right of way off westminster road . as an alternative to developing this row , the department of conservation and recreation ( dcr ) allowed pmld access through its right of way along stage coach trail since 1984 in order to minimize the environmental impact of an additional access road to the same site . a site plan will be created detailing all topographic details , cut and fill , and grade change . upon completion of the installation , topsoil will be reapplied over all of the cleared areas , and the site will be vegetated . pmld will request both dcr and ma audubon to recommend what state the cleared portion of the 16 acre is returned to , when construction is completed . the site could be allowed to return to its natural state ( forest ) or the site could be maintained as open-space with periodic brush cutting and mowing . maintaining the site as open-space will ensure more accurate post avian studies . pmld will not install exterior lighting on the site except for the faa required lighting on top of each tower . the gravel access road will be maintained to allow access to the site . pmld and outsourced preventative maintenance workers will visit the site approximately two days per month during the spring , summer and fall . pmld will not access the site by vehicle during the winter months unless there is an emergency . the turbine equipment will be monitored remotely by pmld ’ s scada system and site access will be minimal during the winter months . the existing improved gravel access road on our 16 acre site will remain after construction is complete . the access road will end with enough room for vehicles to turn around . no dedicated parking spaces will be constructed or are necessary . trail access during construction pmld will coordinate construction activities in order to minimize impact on visitors and hikers to the reservation . although the construction schedule anticipates 36 weeks of construction to complete the project , only small portions of the that time will involve heavy use and activity on stage coach trail . grading and compacting the road will take approximately 3-4 weeks , delivery and pouring the cement will take approximately 1 week , and delivery of the turbine and tower will take approximately 1 week . all other work will take place on pmld ’ s site and only require vehicle access along stage coach trail . pmld will work with dcr to coordinate the timing of construction , trail access , and alternative access to the reservation trail system during construction . section 22 : project schedule pmld developed a 36-week project schedule outlining all of the major design and construction tasks . this schedule accounts for all long lead items , a likely ground breaking project start date , and includes “ adverse weather ” days . given that the physical turbine erection will take place during the relatively calm summer months , we have included only minimal “ adverse weather days ” for this task . moreover , we have assumed that the crane being used for the installation will not require a complete demobilization and remobilization when moving between the two turbine sites . our preliminary project schedule is broken down into various tasks . long lead time equipment and significant tasks include : wind turbines have a 6-12 month lead-time transformers and various switchgear items have between 10-14 week lead time site preparation and access road work takes 1-2 months drilling and pad construction takes 1-2 months the foundation must cure for at least 30 days before concrete testing and consequent turbine installation the turbines are installed by crane in 2-3 weeks turbine commissioning is completed within 1 week earliest ground breaking : the long lead-times required for the wind turbines provide project flexibility , as the design and construction tasks can be completed well within a 3-6 month timeframe . this allows us to complete all site work well before turbine delivery is anticipated . heavy snowfall will impede the mobilization of erection equipment at the site and therefore turbine erection must be coordinated in the spring , summer or fall months . schedule logic and staffing : the proposed project schedule below presents a preliminary map of the various construction phases leading up to the installation of the turbines . we believe there is great flexibility with regard to paralleling some construction tasks , although space limitations may limit the productivity of multiple crews at times . once the site is cleared and grubbed , foundation preparations can take place concurrently with trenching for the feeders and final site grading and compacting . we propose this to ensure that any necessary ledge removal is completed before the foundations are installed or the turbines are erected . the manitowoc 2250 requires 15 tractor trailer trucks and a crew of six for assembly . pmld plans to mobilize a turbine erection crew consisting of two crane operators ( for both the 300-ton crane and the assist crane ) , a crane oiler , and a rigger . the erection crew will include the installer ’ s field manager , two turbine erection technicians , and an installation supervisor from the turbine manufacturer . once the turbines are installed and the transformers and switchgear are in place , a commissioning crew consisting of turbine technicians and a turbine manufacturer ’ s supervisor will complete final hookup and commissioning . once on-line , the turbine manufacturer ’ s supervisor will provide two full days of training for pmld . section 23 : design and installation assumptions pmld has made the following assumptions in the development of our price quotes for this project : pmld will prepare and submit all necessary and applicable permits pertaining to this project . wind turbine foundations are based on the assumption that the bedrock at the proposed sites is suitable for a “ typical ” design . ultimately , the results of a site-specific geotechnical analysis will dictate the final foundation designs and consequent costs . gravel/fill material is available at a nearby gravel pit . excavation to a depth of 4-5 feet . we have tentatively assumed that excavations for trenching and foundations will not require ledge removal . should ledge removal be required , the installation contractor will be required to do the necessary drilling , blasting , and removal . sales or usage tax has not been included in our price quotes . applicable import duties are included in the price of the turbines . electrical service will be required during the installation of the proposed wind turbines . the existing transformer at pmld ’ s wind site will remain operative during the project , and that supplementary portable electric generators will not be required . during the installation of the turbines , pmld assumes that the 300-ton manitowoc crane will require only one day of mobilization/demobilization between the two turbine sites . although pmld has requested turnkey quotes , we may complete some of the installation tasks associated with this project in order to reduce costs . all price quotes developed herein reflect complete turnkey services . some of the tasks in this scope of work will be completed with 12-hour workdays . pmld assumes that there will be no problems associated with access or construction during these extended workdays . loss of use ( business interruption insurance ) is not included in this proposal but will be required once the units are in operation . transportation estimates provided by wind turbine manufacturers vary significantly . actual freight costs may differ at the time of shipping and will be reflected in final project price . section 24 : wind turbine erection methods pmld proposes to use a 300-ton manitowoc 2250 series c crane with a luffing jib to erect the wind turbines . the installation contractor must have relationships with several crane services in the massachusetts region that can provide cranes of this size . a sample wind turbine assembly layout is included in appendix 2. the erection sequence will be carried out in standard format : tower sections and nacelle being placed , then followed by the complete rotor assembly ( the rotor will require all open area at the lift site during its assembly ) . all weather and safety precautions will be taken . the secondary ( small ) crane will be used to support this erection sequence . section 25 : preventative maintenance and turbine operation preventative maintenance the project cost will include a 2-3 year maintenance agreement with the manufacturer . the units will be maintained by the manufacturer according to their recommended schedule . pmld ’ s staff will accompany the manufacturer during every pm visit during the first 2-3 years in order to learn the manufacturer ’ s pm process . pmld will assume pm in year four if the manufacturer certifies our staff proficient and honors the extended manufacturer warranty . manufacturer ’ s warranty the project cost will include a 2-year manufacturer ’ s warranty . pmld will purchase an additional 3-year manufacturer ’ s warranty to cover the equipment through years 3-5. construction insurance pmld will require the installation contractor to purchase full insurance coverage for this project including liability , site , and equipment breakage for the construction period . corrective maintenance insurance pmld will purchase property insurance to cover all major corrective maintenance and catastrophic equipment failures including lightning , mechanical failure , tower collapse , etc . the insurance policy will include power replacement coverage as well , to ensure that pmld does not incur any costs for replacement power in the event the turbines are off-line due to corrective maintenance or catastrophic equipment failure . hazardous materials no hazardous materials will be stored on site . pmld will install oil-filled transformers for this project . the insulating oil is non-hazardous “ mineral oil ” . each transformer pad will include emergency oil overflow reservoirs . as the proposed wind turbines are induction machines , they require a significant volume of gearbox oil . standard preventative practices will be employed to ensure that this oil does not enter the environment during the installation and operation of the turbines . the transformers and gearboxes will be inspected monthly during preventative maintenance visits to ensure containment of oil based insulation and lubricating fluids . spares and special tools all turbine manufacturers will provide a detailed list of recommended spare items . the manufacturer will determine the most appropriate spares inventory for this project . pmld will contact other municipal and private wind farms to coordinate a spare parts inventory list . life span and decommissioning the life span of a wind turbine is about 20 years and occasionally up to 30 years . at this stage , the turbines can either be replaced or removed . turbines can be removed as quickly as they are erected ( about one per day ) . the foundations and underground cabling can be removed from the site , but it is generally recommended that foundations are simply covered over , and that tracks and cabling be allowed to remain . the scrap value of the turbines will generally cover a proportion of the cost of decommissioning . the board of light commissioners will decide what to do with the turbines at the end of their useful life . section 26 : operational issues potential sources of pollution wind energy is an extremely clean electricity source . no airborne or other pollutants are emitted during the operation of the wind turbines . wind turbines do require the use of hydraulic and/or gearbox oil . transformers are oil-cooled using non-hazardous mineral oil . any potential oil leak would be contained inside the turbine tower or transformer pedestal and would be prevented from reaching the surrounding environment by enclosed basins capable of retaining 110 % of the oil holding capacity . also , the transformer will be installed on an impermeable concrete slab , with a lip designed to contain any oil spill . no harmful waste or pollutant will be discharged into the environment during the construction time period . all normal precautionary measures and standard construction practices will be implemented to minimize disturbance to the site , control runoff and sedimentation , noise levels , dust emissions , to avoid oil or fuel spills , and to collect waste . as a precautionary measure , the project will allow only construction and craning equipment in good repair on site . furthermore , emergency response spill kits will be maintained on site in the event of the loss of containment of hazardous fluids . noise levels are expected to increase during the construction period . road graders , construction equipment , cranes and increased traffic will be the major sources of noise , which will result in minor inconveniences for local residents and hikers . potential cause of resource conflicts recreational land use around the construction site is expected to be temporarily affected during construction only . as such , no resource use conflict is expected between the wind power project and recreational use of the neighboring reservation . other land uses in the area are limited and no particular resource conflict is expected with the implementation and operation of the wind turbines . construction period mitigation measures in order to minimize the amount of environmental impact the project could generate , certain mitigation measures will be implemented . prevention of non-native vegetation species from colonizing the area ( dispersed by machinery and workers ) by ensuring the machinery is clean timing of construction : undertaken to minimize impact on the soils and vegetation use existing roads as much as possible avoid ecologically sensitive areas should any objects of archaeological value be found during construction , work should stop temporarily to allow a qualified archaeologist to assess the importance of the finding and devise a suitable mitigation plan , including buffers to protect the site . minimize the amount of vegetation removed from the site . avoid construction during avian nesting seasons silt controls to monitor the amount of silt created by the access roads . these measures will be included in a detailed environmental protection plan ( epp ) that will be developed and submitted to the department of environment prior to the onset of the project construction activities . emergency access and parking the access road on pmld ’ s site will act as parking for the site and can accommodate the turning radius of operation and emergency vehicles . site lighting no site lighting will be installed except for the faa require tower light ( see section 27 ) drainage and strom water the access road will be designed using pervious gravel and materials . no special drainage is required because the road is pervious ( see construction documents for more details ) . the access road will be design to accommodate and properly discharge storm water and snow melt . security of site turbines are monopole structures with lockable porthole type doors . turbines are climbed from within the tower using osha approved lad safe system . the monopole can not be climbed on the outside . the door to each turbine is locked at all times and access through the door is monitored through the scada system monitored at pmld ’ s operation center . access road gate the access road to the site will be gated and locked at all times . only authorized employees and contractors will be allowed to utilize the access road . keys to the gate will be maintained at pmld , wachusett mountain visitor center , princeton police department , and the princeton fire department . site fencing the site will remain open and unfenced . the towers and transformers will be locked and appropriate signage will indicate the potential damage to equipment and personnel if the devices are tampering with . site perimeter signage pmld will install signage around the perimeter of the site to inform the public the site is the town of princeton ’ s wind farm . the signage will also inform the public that the site is a renewable energy generation facility ; it will also provide a phone number , monitored 24 hours a day , for emergencies and questions . the perimeter sign dimension will be approximately 12 ’ x 24 ’ mounted on steel posts . energy kiosk and display pmld will also install am energy kiosk at the entrance to our wind farm to provide the public with information describing ; what the wind farm is , why it was constructed , the annual energy produced , safety concerns , and emergency phone numbers . the kiosk will be located on pmld ’ s property at the corner of the access road and the 16 acre site . the 3 ’ x 5 ’ display will be constructed to match similar displays within the wachusett mountain reservation . section 27 : visual impact most forms of electricity generation have drawbacks . for example , the air pollution and greenhouse gases resulting from oil , coal , or natural gas generated electricity can ’ t be seen , but is serious in terms of impact on human health and on the environment . with wind power , what you see is what you get . wind farms are clean , and very visible . the installation of a two , 70 meter tall wind turbines in a rural and mostly wooded location will certainly be visible from various locations . even our existing eight 100 ’ wind turbines are visible from various locations in the area . the wind turbines are sited in the environment they are meant to protect . the turbines are well masked by the nature tree canopy and the natural rolling topography surrounding the site . the tubular towers and the aerodynamic blades have been designed with smooth lines that tend to have greater aesthetic value than our older lattice tower type wind turbines . they are considered attractive industrial structures . improvements in technology have also lowered the speed of the turbines . our exiting existing turbines spin at approximately 70 rpm ’ s , while the new , but much larger turbines spin at only 17-20 rpm ’ s . this slow speed reduces noise and creates a more aesthetically pleasing site . photo simulations were created by the renewable energy research laboratory at the university of massachusetts . pmld floated two balloons at the 70m hub height in order to create a reference point for some of the photo simulations . see attached photo simulations of wind farm from various locations photo simulation from scenic overlook ledges to wind farm photo simulation from wachusett mountain summit to wind farm photo simulation from brown hill to wind farm photo simulation from 106 thompson road to wind farm photo simulation from 67 westminster road to wind farm photo simulation from 178 westminster road to wind farm photo simulation from 191 westminster to wind farm photo simulation between 178 and 191 westminster to wind farm flicker shadow the rotation of the wind turbine blades during periods with low sun angles and bright sun , such as early morning , may result in a flickering , or shadow . this effect is typically limited to the time the sun is directly behind the turbines . since the closest private property is 2,400 ’ away from the wind farm , it is unlike any flicker shadow will occur . shadow flicker typically occurs when the observer or property is much closer to the turbines and inline with the turbines and sun . see attachment : solar shadow effects , pb power , may 2004 section 28 : faa required warning lights faa advisory circular ac 70/7460-1k states that warning lights should be installed on wind turbine structures . in order to comply with the faa advisory , pmld selected the least intrusive lighting system available , which will minimize the impact to the environment ( birds ) and surrounding community . pmld will install a medium intensity white strobe light for night and day use . the strobe light will be programmed to strobe for the longest period of time allowed . the flash rate will be approximately 40 flashes per minute during the day and 20 flashes per minute during the night . the slow flash rates allow the lamp to completely darken . this technique has proven to be less distractive to communities and avian life . pmld will also utilize fixtures that have the lowest amount of stray light and shielding to prevent light pollution below the horizon of the generator enclosure on top of the tower . the lights will be located on top of the generator enclosure , which tends to mask the light from shining directly down . the faa allows cone shields to prevent the light from directing downward . pmld will ensure the lights are installed in a position on top of the generator enclosure with cone shields in order to prevent stray light from impacting the community and environment . faa publishes strict guidelines on the amount of stray light that can emit below the horizon . in fact , the amount of stray light below the horizon can not exceed 75 candelas , the approximate light intensity of a 60w light bulb . most manufacturers design strobe lights so that stray light does not exceed 25 candelas or 1/3 the amount of the standard . when the time comes to specify the strobe lights , pmld will ensure we utilize the manufacturer with the lowest stray light as compared to the faa standard . the faa has determined that our wind farm does not exceed obstruction standards and would not be a hazard to air navigation . see attached : “ faa , determination of no hazard to air navigation ” dated july 25 , 2002 section 29 : noise modern wind turbines create very little noise above the natural background noise typically caused by wind . the noise level from the turbines proposed at our site is significantly less than the noise level of the existing units . in order to provide a perspective of sound levels , consider the fact that normal conversation is approximately 60dbs . the noise level in a bedroom at night is approximately 30dbs . the sound from a new wind turbine can be equated to trees rustling in the wind or ocean waves breaking . the small amount of sound at close distances is not intrusive but is considered background noise , similar to wind and ocean sounds or even a refrigerator humming . during quiet non-windy days and nights , the units will not operate and there is no noise . generally speaking as the wind approaches the speeds necessary for the turbines to work , you will hear more wind and background related noise than anything else . since the closest private property is approximately 2,200 ’ from the turbines , our noise studies , completed by umass renewable energy research laboratory and pb power , indicate that without taking into consideration wind related background noise and forest or topographic barriers that tend to mask noise , the level of noise at 2,200 ’ will be 36 db ( a ) . this noise level is slightly louder than whispering . based on our studies and including normal wind related background noise , there will be little or no noise , 2,200 ’ ( 670m ) away from the turbine . ( see attached noise studies ) it ’ s important to reiterate that the existing ( 8 ) turbines generate significantly more noise than the proposed units . technology improvements and slower blade rotation significantly reduces the noise levels of newer turbines . based on studies ( see figure 1 ) completed by the national renewable energy laboratory ( aiaa-2004-1185 ) , the existing units generate noise levels ranging from 60-65 db ( a ) , at approximately 122 ’ ( measured using hub height plus ½ the blade diameter ) away from the turbine at ground level . figure 1 , noise characteristics of existing pmld turbines compared to typical background noise based on the manufacturers noise curve ( see figure 2 ) for a nm82 wind turbine , the noise generated from the proposed units will be approximately 50-55 db ( a ) , 364 ’ away from the base of the turbine . noise levels will diminish with distance from the turbines and at approximately 1,968 ’ ( 600m ) the noises of the turbines is completely masked by natural background noise . figure 2 , neg micon nm82 sound power level characteristics , august 2003 acoustic emission measurements conform to applicable elements of iec 61400-11 `` acoustic emissions measurements . '' the purpose of this measurement standard is to document the acoustic emission characteristics of the wind turbine type . this standard was developed to provide a uniform methodology that will ensure consistency and accuracy in the measurement and analysis of acoustic emissions by wind turbine generator systems ( wtgs ) . see attached noise studies : acoustic noise impact assessment , pb power , may 28 , 2002 university of massachusetts , renewable energy research laboratory , wind turbine report completed november 2002. located in section 9 of this report . section 30 : avian impact bird fatalities at wind generation sites are very low . studies at existing sites indicate only 2.19 bird deaths per turbine per year ( nwcc ) . migrating birds , like hawks , tend to fly above 500 feet . pmld hired avian expert , dr. paul kerlinger of “ curry & kerlinger ” to analyze potential avian impact at our site ( see attached bird risk report by paul kerlinger , september 2002 ) . dr. kerlinger was the former audubon director of the cape may bird observatory in new jersey and authored “ how birds migrate ( 1995 ) and flight strategies of migrating hawks ( 1989 ) . dr. kerlinger ’ s visit and analysis indicates that avian risk from our project is likely to be low and not significant . in perspective , more birds die annually from the following : 100 million annually flying into glass windows 100 million from house cats ( source : american bird conservancy ) 50-100 million from automobiles and trucks 4-10 million from guyed communications towers over 500 ’ from the total number of turbines installed in the united stated , only 10,000 – 40,000 avian fatalities per year are expected . however , because our site is in a known migration path , pmld will perform a post avian study during the first 2-3 years of operation . pmld will request dem and ma audubon ’ s assistance in selecting and approving the post avian study methodology . pmld ’ s property is approximately one mile away from the summit of mount wachusett . since there is a large number of migrating hawks during a specific time of the year ( typically october ) , pmld will provide the hawk watch community our emergency contact numbers in order to alert pmld when conditions occur that increase the risk of avian fatalities . these events may include low visibility , fog , and specific weather events . in these events , pmld will stop the turbines in order to minimize the risk to migrating birds . bird collisions earlier turbine tower designs used latticed towers , which were frequently used by raptors as perching locations allowing for a clear view of open land ( kerlinger , 2001 ) . studies have shown a predominance of bird strikes during take-off , as the birds were carried by the draft into the rotor of downwind-operated turbines . today 's wind turbines are essentially upwind machines ( i.e . the rotor is upwind from the tower ) , commonly mounted on tubular towers , where raptors have no opportunity to perch . furthermore , large turbines have reduced rotational speeds ( 17 to 24 rpm ) , which decreases the chances of bird collisions . also , recent reviews of avian impact studies conducted at wind power facilities in europe and in the united states reveal that bird turbine interactions resulting in bird fatalities represent extremely minor occurrences . nowhere in europe ( even in tarifa , spain and coastal netherlands ) and in all but one location in the united states ( altamont pass , ca ) have these impacts been judged to be significant or to cause avian population problems or impact rare or threatened species ( kerlinger , 2001 ) . finally , the numbers of fatalities reported at wind plants has been extremely small , especially when compared to other sources of human induced mortality as indicated in the table above ( kerlinger , 2001 ) . mitigation and monitoring measures pmld will implement mitigation measures to ensure minimal environmental and avian impact : tubular towers will be installed to reduce the possibility of birds perching on the towers . ( tubular towers also improve the aesthetics of the wind farm ) the electrical distribution lines connecting the wind turbines to pmld distribution system will be installed underground . this prevents avian perch points and improves aesthetics . any equipment brought to the site during the construction period will be in good repair , to prevent oil , grease , or other hazardous spills . grass will be planted on disturbed areas after construction pmld is committed to developing and implementing a post study on the effects of the wind farm project on migrating birds in the area . the highest probability of bird strikes is during the spring and fall bird migration periods . critical migration periods ( spring and fall ) will be identified and these periods will be the focus of monitoring avian fatalities associated with the wind farm . this program will determine the level of wind turbine bird mortality during migration . in developing the post study , the pmld will ensure there are clear and achievable objectives and hypotheses , temporal and spatial controls , and practical methodologies . pmld will also consult with regulatory authorities and stakeholders to discuss aspects of this study prior its implementation . the study ’ s results will help quantify bird mortality during migration periods . results of the study will be used to design , implement and eventually evaluate mitigation strategies that may be required to address the bird mortality issue . see attached : bird risk report from dr. kerlinger dated september 10 , 2002 study plan for post-construction monitoring , dated february 8 , 2003 section 31 : icing the new units are designed to withstand low temperatures , wind , and icing conditions . icing events that result in significant ice accretion are not common at our location . only 3-5 ice events per year are expected at the princeton site . there are two types of ice that can form on wind turbines : glaze and rime ( manwell 2000 ) . meteorologists classify transparent and homogeneous ice similar to ice cubes , which forms on vertical and horizontal surfaces , as glaze . its amorphous , dense structure clings tenaciously to any surface on which it forms . in contrast , milky and crystalline ice is termed rime . rime lacks the transparency of glaze , is less dense , and does not cling as tenaciously as glaze . given our site elevation is only 1,500 ’ glaze ice is more common than rime ice . however small the number of ice events is , some small amount of ice will accumulate on either the existing towers and turbines and the new ones . this same ice also accretes on the trees surrounding our site , on our overhead utility lines along our roads , and on the mature tree canopy that covers stage coach trail adjacent to the wind site . typically , significant ice events last only 24-48 hours before melting off the existing turbines and trees . the risk of a hiker being hit by dropping ice is less than from the tree given the shape , size , and diameter of the new tower , ice build-up is less of a risk with the new units as compared to the existing towers . the new tower will be a non-guyed 8 ’ -14 ’ diameter monopole tower . the large diameter and surface area decreases the likelihood of ice accretion as compared to our existing lattice style towers small diameter blades . the new units also rotate slower at only 20 rpm as compared to 70 rpm by the existing units . the slower blade speed and reduced number of turbines from the existing eight to only two , also reduces the risk of ice accretion and ice throw . pmld will install sensors that monitor ice accretion , which will shut down the turbines during significant ice events . this safety feature is not present on our existing turbines . the turbine control system ( scada ) will send an alert to pmld ’ s 24-hour dispatch . once the turbines are shut down and the warning sent , pmld ’ s staff must visibly check the site for ice accretion . the turbines will not be restarted until the ice melts away or is removed by jogging the turbines blades ( jogging is a quick start and stop operation that flex ’ s the fiberglass turbine blades enough to cause the ice to break off and fall to the ground ) . during weather conditions that may lead icing , pmld will supervise the wind turbine site more closely . the turbine scada system will monitor the site 24 hours a day . the controls of the turbine will automatically perform the following functions in order to shut down the units and minimize the risk of ice throw during an ice event . power curve : ice accretion on the blades has a big influence on the lift force and therefore on the power curve of the wind turbine generator ( wtg ) . the power curve is programmed into the control system and is always compared with the actual power output . when the mean ( average ) of the power is continuously out of the power curve for 2 minutes , it is an indication that ice has accumulated on the blades and the wtg will be stopped automatically . the turbine stays off until it is reset manually by an operator who must physically visit the site to determine if icing is present . if icing is present the operator will jog the turbine to shed the ice or keep the turbine off until the ice melts away naturally . vibration sensors : additional loads resulting from iced blades cause vibrations which are monitored by the control system . when the vibrations exceed the adjusted limits , the turbines will be stopped . the turbine will stay off until it is reset manually again , after an operator physically the visits to determine the cause of the vibration . ice sensors : the ice sensor is installed on the roof of the nacelle ( generator enclosure ) . ice sensors measure the temperature and the relative air humidity of the environment . if certain values are measured which indicate ice , the turbine is stopped by the control system . the meteorological values are determined from national weather institutes . the turbine can only be restarted manually after an operator physically visits the site to ensure the unit is clear of ice and it is safe to restart the unit . in all these cases an autonomous restart of the turbine is impossible and ice throw is avoided and minimized . shut down and restart of the turbine are recorded in the alarm list of the control system and can be provided to anyone requesting the information to prove the reliability if our system . signage will be fixed on the turbine and site perimeter to warning passing pedestrians of the risk . section 32 : massachusetts historic commission massachusetts historic commission ’ s ( mhc ) conducted a site review of the wind farm project , on september 16 , 2003. pmld and mhc visited the various historic properties and districts in princeton as inventoried by mhc and included on the national register . the topography of princeton and mature tree canopies generally hide the new turbines from the majority of these sites . pmld developed various topographic profiles in order to determine that the new wind farm is not visible from many of the historic locations . where they are visible , pmld plans to mitigate with appropriate signage and displays , explaining the wind farm and its associated environmental benefits . overall pmld believes there is no adverse impact on these locations . pmld has operated a wind farm in this location for almost 20 years and we are replacing eight turbines with only two new units . the two new turbines are significantly larger but they will not impact the view-shed any more than the original units . in fact , the new units operate at a slower , more graceful speed , and the monopole towers tend to be more attractive than our existing lattice style towers . attached are the various topographic profiles of each site we visited or discussed . the profiles clearly illustrate whether or not the wind farm is visible from the various historic locations . ma inventoried locations is wind farm visible ? bullock ski lodge no dcr visitors center no dcr superintendent ’ s house no scenic overlook ledges yes wachusett mountain summit yes edward goodnow house no nation register locations princeton center historic center no fernside no the existing wind turbines , installed in 1984 , are also visible from some of the mhc inventoried locations in princeton . since the wind farm may be visible from at two of the inventoried locations , pmld proposes the following mitigation strategies at three department of conservation and recreation ( dcr ) locations . dcr superintendents house this property is currently closed and visitors do not utilize the facility . the facility is scheduled to be renovated by dcr in the future , as an educational center for the wachusett mountain reservation . given the terrain and mature tree canopy at this location , the turbines will not be visible from the rear of this property . even though the units are not visible from this location , pmld proposes to install a renewable energy education display/kiosk . the educational material in the kiosk would provide information to the public about princeton ’ s wind farm , renewable energy generation , and energy efficient products . this type of static display would also explain the environmental benefits of wind turbines and how they are sited within the environment they are meant to protect . pmld would also be available to conduct educational seminars related to wind energy , for groups and individuals visiting the visitor ’ s center . scenic overlook ledges this is the only location that will have a direct view of the two new turbines . this location is along the up-road to the summit of wachusett mountain . pmld is not sure if this location is an inventoried historic site , but since it provides a great view of the existing and proposed wind turbines , we developed an accurate photo simulation from this location . the attached photo simulation clearly illustrates the existing and proposed turbines . the old turbines , which have been visible since 1984 , will be removed once construction begins . pmld believes there is no adverse impact to this location since we are replacing the eight turbines with two new units . the two new turbines are significantly larger but they will not impact the view-shed any more than the original units . in fact , the new units operate at a slower , more graceful speed , and the monopole towers tend to be more attractive than our existing lattice style towers . pmld proposes to install a renewable energy education display/kiosk at this location with dcr approval . a kiosk or static display would explain the renewable energy project and environmental benefits of the wind turbines visible from this location . wachusett mountain summit there are approximately 13 historic properties inventoried by mhc at the summit of wachusett mountain . none of these inventoried locations have a direct view of the existing or proposed wind farm . most of the historic viewing locations at the summit point in an easterly direction away from the wind farm . the new turbines will be visible from the summit in a southwesterly direction from the junction of harrington trail and the fire tower . the wind farm is approximately 1 mile away . pmld was able to accurately create a photo simulation of the new wind turbines from one location on the summit of wachusett mountain . the new wind turbines will be visible from the summit looking in a southwesterly direction at the junction of harrington trail and the base of the existing fire/communication tower on the summit . the wind farm is approximately 1 mile away from this location . as you can see from the photo simulation , the wind turbines are attractive and not overbearing in proportion to the view shed . since the wind turbines are visible from this location , pmld proposes to install a renewable energy education display/kiosk . a kiosk or static display would explain to visitors to the summit , the town of princeton ’ s renewable energy project and the associated environmental benefits of the wind turbines visible from this location . topographic profiles in addition to the photo simulations found in section 26 , pmld created the following profiles of the topography between each historic property and the wind farm . each topographic profile confirms whether or not the wind farm is visible form the various historic locations in princeton . topographic profile from bullock ski lodge to wind farm topographic profile from dcr visitors center to wind farm topographic profile from dcr superintendent ’ s house to wind farm topographic profile from scenic overlook ledges to wind farm topographic profile from wachusett mountain summit to wind farm topographic profile from edward goodnow house to wind farm topographic profile from princeton center historic center to wind farm topographic profile from fernside to wind farm topographic profile from east princeton historic district to wind farm as illustrated in topographic profile 4 and 5 , the wind turbines will be visible at two historic locations in princeton . however , it is important to note that the existing turbines are visible from these historic locations as well . pmld believes there is no additional impact from installing the two new turbines at our existing wind farm . photo simulations of the wind farm from these locations are found in section 26. as noted earlier , pmld proposes to install energy kiosks at these locations in order to help mitigate the visual impact of princeton ’ s wind farm . section 33 : benefits to the general public and wachusett mountain state reservation pmld prefers to utilize the existing access road along stage coach trail . the existing access road is owned and controlled by the department of conservation and recreation ( dcr ) . when the original wind was installed in 1984 , dcr allowed pmld to utilize stage coach trail as an alternative to pmld developing a second road to the same site along pmld ’ s legal right of way . pmld will request dcr to grant access along stage coach trail through the mepa process . pmld will file an enf describing the two options for access to the site . if dcr allows pmld continued access along stage coach trail , pmld will begin the legal process of exchanging its legal right-of-way with a new right-of-way along stage coach trail . pmld believes the following benefits justify continued access along stage coach trail and the eventual exchange of legal right-of-ways . pmld ’ s right of way ( row ) will not be developed : pmld will not develop its legal row and remove approximately 1 acre of matures trees through dcr ’ s property . in exchange , dcr would allow pmld to continue using the existing access road pmld has utilized for the last 19 years . the condition of the exiting access road is adequate , needing only minor improvements such as gravel and compaction . there is significantly more environmental impact to the reservation , if pmld constructs is legal right of way to the wind farm . pmld will give dcr , 5-8 acres of land not developed at the wind farm : dcr ’ s harrington trail currently follows a path through the town of princeton ’ s 16 acre wind farm . pmld will request the town of princeton to give dcr , ownership and control , of the land surrounding that portion of harrington trail on town owned property . pmld would also request the town of princeton to give dcr , ownership and control of any unused portion of the wind farm so that it could not be developed in the future . this could potentially add approximately 5-8 acres of land to the reservation at no cost to dcr . electric service to mountain road visitors center : pmld will design and install an underground electrical service to the new mountain road visitors center . the design and installation will include approximately 300 ’ of conduct , underground conductors , and connection to pmld ’ s electrical distribution system at no cost to dcr . renewable energy static display and kiosk : pmld will provide and install renewable energy education kiosks at the new visitor ’ s center or existing visitors facility on mountain road valued at approximately $ 3,000 . the material would include information related to renewable energy production and energy efficiency . pmld will also provide and install a static display on stage coach trail and on the summit of wachusett mountain to highlight information related to the wind farm for hikers and visitors to the reservation . solar energy demonstration project : pmld will provide and install a 300w , solar panel system , to demonstrate the latest technology in solar energy technology at the existing or new visitor ’ s center on mountain road . this solar energy demonstration project would reduce the wachusett mountain visitors center ’ s actual energy consumption , save money , and act as a renewable energy educational tool for the public . solar panels and renewable energy displays would also demonstrate dcr ’ s commitment to both protecting the natural environment and utilizing renewable energy . overhead electrical service to mountain summit : the overhead electric service to the summit of wachusett mountain is approximately fifty years old and includes 50 utility poles and over one mile of electrical conductors . dcr , as the owner , is responsible for all preventative and corrective maintenance to this electric service . pmld has performed preventative and corrective maintenance on this electric service at no cost to dcr over the last 10 years . the annual costs are approximately $ 5,000 - $ 15,000 depending on how much damage is caused by weather related events . pmld will continue to provide preventative and corrective maintenance at no cost to dcr and assist dcr is designing a new electric service to the summit . new access road to summit : pmld understands that a new access road will be constructed to the summit of wachusett mountain . this project should incorporate a new underground electrical service to the summit , to replace dcr ’ s existing overhead electric service mentioned above . pmld will design and connect the new underground service for dcr at no cost . the approximate value of these services is $ 20,000 - $ 25,000 . renewable energy : as a customer of pmld , the wachusett mountain visitors center will receive a large percentage of its electricity from renewable resources . the new wind farm and existing hydroelectric power supplies would increase the percentage of renewable energy delivered to the wachusett mountain visitors center to approximately 40 % at no additional cost or premium . dcr could take advantage of this fact and actively market its commitment to protecting the environment by utilizing a significant amount of reliable and cost effective renewable energy . educational seminars and tours : pmld will continue to provide personnel and material resources to help educate visitors to the reservation about wind energy and its associated environmental benefits . since 1984 , pmld has conducted various educational seminars about renewable energy for students , teachers , and reservation visitors . pmld has also participated in nature hikes with dcr staff to educate visitors about renewable energy as they hike to the summit wachusett mountain . pmld believes that our new wind farm will draw more visitors to the reservation and lead to a greater awareness of renewable energy and its place in our environment . road improvements to stage coach trail : pmld will maintain the access road at no cost to dcr and will repair the culverts at the beginning of stage coach trail . pmld ’ s maintenance will include culverts , water dams , and periodic grading of the access road to ensure the road is maintained in an esthetically pleasing manner . signage : pmld will provide and install appropriate signage around the wind farm to instruct visitors as to the various safety considerations while hiking through and around the area of the wind farm . stage coach trail parking area : in order to improve access to the reservation and enhance vehicle/pedestrian safety , pmld proposes to install a parking area on dcr owned land at the intersection of stage coach trail and westminster road . a new , crushed stone parking area could accommodate up to 10 vehicles . vehicles must currently park along the side of westminster road , because of the lack of any dedicated visitor parking spaces for visitors to the reservation .
