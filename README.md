## Word Embedding Approach for Synonym Extraction of Multi-Word Terms.

We introduce Semi-Compositional **Semi-Comp** and Full-Compositional **FullComp** approaches to deal with synonym acquisition of multiword terms. We conducted experiments on two specialized domains using wind energy and breasdt cancer data sets in French and English. Our results show significant improvements over the state of the art.
